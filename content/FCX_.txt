copper gold and molybdenum 

following is a brief discussion of our primary natural resources  copper gold and molybdenum for further discussion of historical and current market prices of these commodities refer to mda 

copper 

copper is an internationally traded commodity and its prices are determined by the major metals exchanges  the london metal exchange lme commodity exchange inc comex and shanghai futures exchange prices on these exchanges generally reflect the worldwide balance of copper supply and demand and can be volatile and cyclical during 2021 the lme copper settlement price averaged 423 per pound ranging from a low of 352 per pound to a record high of 486 per pound and was 440 per pound on december 31 2021 

in general demand for copper reflects the rate of underlying world economic growth particularly in industrial production and construction according to wood mackenzie a widely followed independent metals market consultant copper’s enduse markets and their estimated shares of total consumption are construction 29 percent electrical applications 27 percent consumer products 22 percent transportation 11 percent and industrial machinery 11 percent we believe copper will continue to be essential in these basic uses as well as contribute significantly to new technologies for clean energy to advance communications and to enhance public health examples of areas we believe will require additional copper in the future include i high efficiency motors which consume up to 75 percent more copper than a standard motor ii electric vehicles which consume up to four 

times the amount of copper in terms of weight compared to vehicles of similar size with an internal combustion engine and require copperintensive charging station infrastructure to refuel and iii renewable energy such as wind and solar which consume four to five times the amount of copper compared to traditional fossil fuel generated power 

gold 

gold is used for jewelry coinage and bullion as well as various industrial and electronic applications gold can be readily sold on numerous markets throughout the world benchmark prices are generally based on london bullion market association london quotations during 2021 the london pm gold price averaged 1799 per ounce ranging from a low of 1684 per ounce to a high of 1943 per ounce and was 1806 per ounce on december 30 2021 there was no london pm gold price quote on december 31 2021 

molybdenum 

molybdenum is a key alloying element in steel and the raw material for several chemicalgrade products used in catalysts lubrication smoke suppression corrosion inhibition and pigmentation molybdenum as a highpurity metal is also used in electronics such as flatpanel displays and in super alloys used in aerospace reference prices for molybdenum are available in several publications including metals week cru report and metal bulletin  during 2021 the weekly average price of molybdenum quoted by metals week averaged 1592 per pound ranging from a low of 1009 per pound to a high of 2001 per pound and was 1870 per pound on december 31 2021 

products and sales 

our consolidated revenues for 2021 primarily included sales of copper 80 percent gold 11 percent and molybdenum 6 percent copper concentrate sales to pt smelting ptfi’s 395percentowned copper smelter and refinery in gresik indonesia totaled 14 percent of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 12 percent for the year ended december 31 2020 and 13 percent for the year ended december 31 2019 which is the only customer that accounted for 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues during the three years ended december 31 2021 refer to note 16 for a summary of our consolidated revenues and operating income loss by business segment and geographic area 

copper products 

we are one of the world’s leading producers of copper concentrate cathode and continuous cast copper rod during 2021 59 percent of our mined copper was sold in concentrate 21 percent as cathode and 20 percent as rod from our north america operations the copper ore from our mines is generally processed either by smelting and refining or by solution extraction and electrowinning sxew as described below 

copper concentrate  we produce copper concentrate at six of our mines in which mined ore is crushed and treated to produce a copper concentrate with copper content of approximately 20 to 30 percent in north america copper concentrate is produced at the morenci bagdad sierrita and chino mines and a significant portion is shipped to our miami smelter in arizona for further processing copper concentrate is also produced at the cerro verde mine in peru and the grasberg minerals district in indonesia 

copper cathode  we produce copper cathode at our electrolytic refinery located in el paso texas and at nine of our mines 

sxew cathode is produced from the morenci bagdad safford sierrita miami chino and tyrone mines in north america and from the cerro verde and el abra mines in south america  for ore subject to the sxew process the ore is placed on stockpiles and copper is extracted from the ore by dissolving it with a weak sulfuric acid solution the copper content of the solution is increased in two additional sx stages and then the copperbearing solution undergoes an ew process to produce cathode that is on average 9999 percent copper our copper cathode is used as the raw material input for copper rod brass mill products and for other uses 

copper cathode is also produced at atlantic copper our wholly owned copper smelting and refining unit in spain and pt smelting copper concentrate is smelted  ie  subjected to extreme heat to produce copper anode which weighs between 800 and 900 pounds and has an average copper content of 995 percent the anode is further treated by electrolytic refining to produce copper cathode which weighs between 100 and 350 pounds and has an average copper content of 9999 percent refer to “mining operations  smelting facilities and other mining properties” for further discussion of atlantic copper and pt smelting 

continuous cast copper rod  we manufacture continuous cast copper rod at our facilities in el paso texas and miami arizona primarily using copper cathode produced at our north america copper mines 

copper sales 

north america  the majority of the copper produced at our north america copper mines and refined in our el paso texas refinery is consumed at our rod plants to produce copper rod which is sold to wire and cable manufacturers the remainder of our north america copper production is sold in the form of copper cathode or copper concentrate under us dollardenominated annual contracts cathode and rod contract prices are generally based on the prevailing comex monthly average settlement price for the month of shipment and include a premium generally copper cathode is sold to rod brass or tube fabricators during 2021 23 percent of our north america mines’ copper concentrate sales volumes were shipped to atlantic copper for smelting and refining and sold as copper anode and copper cathode by atlantic copper 

south america    production from our south america mines is sold as copper concentrate or copper cathode under us dollardenominated annual and multiyear contracts during 2021 our south america mines sold approximately 75 percent of their copper production in concentrate and 25 percent as cathode during 2021 

5 percent of our south america mines’ copper concentrate sales volumes were shipped to atlantic copper for smelting and refining and sold as copper anode and copper cathode by atlantic copper 

substantially all of our south america copper concentrate and cathode sales contracts provide final copper pricing in a specified future month generally one to four months from the shipment date primarily based on quoted lme monthly average settlement copper prices revenues from our south america concentrate sales are recorded net of royalties and treatment charges  ie fees paid to smelters that are generally negotiated annually in addition because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrate is unrecoverable from the smelting process revenues from our south america concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances for unrecoverable metals which are a negotiated term of the contracts and vary by customer 

indonesia    ptfi sells its production in the form of copper concentrate which contains significant quantities of gold and silver primarily under us dollardenominated longterm contracts ptfi also sells a small amount of copper concentrate in the spot market following is a summary of ptfi’s aggregate percentage of concentrate sales to unaffiliated third parties pt smelting and atlantic copper for the years ended december 31 



substantially all of ptfi’s concentrate sales contracts provide final copper pricing in a specified future month generally one to four months from the shipment date primarily based on quoted lme monthly average settlement copper prices revenues from ptfi’s concentrate sales are recorded net of royalties export duties treatment charges and allowances for unrecoverable metals 

refer to item 1a “risk factors” for discussion of indonesia regulations regarding ptfi’s concentrate exports 

gold products and sales 

we produce gold almost exclusively from the grasberg minerals district the gold we produce is primarily sold as a component of our copper concentrate or in slimes which are a product of the smelting and refining process gold generally is priced at the average london price for a specified month near the month of shipment revenues from gold sold as a component of our copper concentrate are recorded net of treatment charges royalties export duties and allowances for unrecoverable metals revenues from gold sold in slimes are recorded net of refining charges 

molybdenum products and sales 

we are the world’s largest producer of molybdenum and molybdenumbased chemicals in addition to production from the henderson and climax molybdenum mines we produce molybdenum concentrate at certain of the north america copper mines and the cerro verde copper mine in peru the majority of our molybdenum concentrate is processed in our own conversion facilities our molybdenum sales are primarily priced based on the average published metals week price for the month prior to the month of shipment 

governmental regulations 

our operations are subject to a broad range of laws and regulations imposed by governments and regulatory bodies both in the us and internationally these regulations touch all aspects of our operations including how we extract process and explore for minerals and how we conduct our business including regulations governing matters such as environmental and reclamation matters mining rights climate change occupational health and safety and human rights 

environmental and reclamation matters 

our operations are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations including environmental laws and regulations governing the generation storage treatment transportation and disposal of hazardous substances solid waste disposal air emissions wastewater discharges remediation restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination including mine closures and reclamation protection of endangered and threatened species and designation of critical habitats and other related matters in addition we must obtain regulatory permits and approvals to start continue and expand operations as a mining company compliance with environmental health and safety laws and regulations is an integral and costly part of our business we conduct our operations in a manner that aims to protect public health and the environment and we believe our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects 

laws such as the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended cercla and similar state laws may expose us to joint and several liability for environmental damages caused by our operations or by previous owners or operators of properties we acquired or are currently operating or at sites where we previously sent materials for processing recycling or disposal we have substantial obligations for environmental remediation on mining properties previously owned or operated by fmc and certain of its affiliates at december 31 2021 we had 17 billion recorded in our consolidated balance sheet for environmental obligations attributable to cercla or analogous state programs and for estimated future costs associated with environmental matters at closed facilities or closed portions of operating facilities 

we are required by us federal and state laws and regulations to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans for our mining properties if we are unable to do so most of our financial assurance obligations are imposed by state laws that vary significantly by jurisdiction depending on how each state regulates land use and groundwater quality the us environmental protection agency epa and state agencies may also require financial assurance for investigation and remediation actions that are required under settlements of enforcement actions under cercla or similar state laws 

regulations have been considered at various governmental levels to increase financial responsibility requirements both for mine closure and reclamation in 2019 legislation was enacted in colorado that eliminates our ability to use parent company guarantees and requires proof of an end date for water treatment as a condition of permit issuance authorizing mining operations with some exceptions for existing operations in 2018 epa concluded a rulemaking that considered the need for financial responsibility for hardrock mining operations under cercla by publishing its determination that it did not intend to require financial responsibility for the hardrock mining industry sector in 2019 the dc circuit upheld the epa’s decision in connection with the presidential executive order issued on january 20 2021 epa will review this final action though the timing of its review is unknown 

our mining operations are also subject to regulations under the endangered species act esa that are intended to protect species listed by the department of interior’s fish  wildlife service fws as endangered or threatened along with critical habitat designated by fws for these listed species the regulations limit the ability of landowners including us to obtain federal permits or authorizations needed for expansion of our operations and may also affect our ability to obtain retain or deliver water to some operations on october 26 2021 fws published two proposed rules that rescind changes made in 2019 and 2020 to mitigate potential regulatory constraints on mining operations under the esa 

new or revised environmental regulatory requirements are frequently proposed many of which result in substantially increased costs for our business including those regarding financial assurance above and in item 1a “risk factors” for example our miami arizona smelter processes a significant portion of the copper concentrate produced by our north america copper mines epa is currently in the process of revising the standards for hazardous air pollutants from primary copper smelters which could impose additional requirements on our operations we may be required to modify our systems or install additional equipment to address findings new 

requirements or for other reasons which could result in significant costs including increased capital expenditures and operating costs and could adversely impact our business 

epa and state agencies continue to consider regulations for manmade organic compounds that could be present in soil groundwater and surface water at our existing and former operations these regulations may include drinking water standards hazardous waste requirements and hazardous substance designations for perfluorooctanesulfonic and perfluorooctanoic acids epa is also considering how to reduce lead exposure in the environment under multiple environmental programs certain federal and state health agencies also support more stringent lead cleanup levels the timing for these epa activities is unclear but reduction in lead cleanup levels could result in material increases to our environmental reserves for ongoing residential property cleanup projects near former smelter sites 

epa and the department of the army together the agencies continue to consider whether and how to regulate remote “tributaries” under the regulatory definition of “waters of the united states” that are protected by the clean water act these requirements can impose significant additional restrictions on land uses in remote areas with only tenuous connections to active waterways regulations adopted by the agencies in 2015 2019 and 2020 governing “waters of the united states” have been challenged by multiple states and industry parties and litigation on all three final rules is ongoing most recently a federal district court in arizona vacated and remanded the regulations that became effective in 2020 and the agencies subsequently published a proposed rule on december 7 2021 that announced they will revert back to regulations in place prior to 2015 these rules define whether we need federal authorization under the clean water act to expand our operations 

we incurred environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs including our joint venture partners’ shares to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect our operations totaling 03 billion in both 2021 and 2020 and 04 billion in 2019 for 2022 we expect to incur approximately 05 billion of aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs the timing and amounts of estimated payments could change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements changes in scope and costs of reclamation activities the settlement of environmental matters and the rate at which actual spending occurs on continuing matters 

for information about environmental regulation litigation and related costs refer to item 1a “risk factors” and notes 1 and 12 

mining rights 

we conduct our mining and exploration activities pursuant to concessions granted by or under contracts with the host government in the countries where we operate these countries include among others the us peru chile and indonesia mining rights include our license to operate and involve our payment of applicable taxes and royalties to the host governments the concessions and contracts are subject to the political risks associated with the host countries for information about mining rights including laws and regulations applicable to ptfi governmental agreements and licenses to operate refer to “mining operations” below item 1a “risk factors” and notes 3 11 12 and 13 

climate change 

in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate governmental bodies are increasingly enacting legislation and regulations in response to the potential impacts of climate change for example as a result of the 2015 paris agreement a number of governments have pledged “nationally determined contributions” to control and reduce greenhouse gas emissions including the us additionally the recent pledges made as part of the 2021 glasgow climate pact could result in further policy changes in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate further several states in the us including colorado and new mexico have advanced goals reducing or eliminating fossil fuelbased energy production carbon tax legislation also has been adopted in jurisdictions where we operate including indonesia and we expect that such carbon taxes and other carbon pricing mechanisms will increase over time we anticipate that we will dedicate more resources and money to comply and remediate in response to legislative or regulatory changes and our ability to modify our operations to avoid these costs may be limited in the near term however it is not yet possible to reasonably estimate the nature extent timing and cost or other impacts of any future carbon pricing mechanisms other climate change regulatory programs or future legislative action that may be enacted 

for information about the potential impacts of climate change and related regulations refer to item 1a “risk factors” 

health and safety 

the safety and health of our workforce is our highest priority management believes that safety and health considerations are integral to and compatible with all other functions in the organization and that proper safety and health management will enhance production and reduce costs we are subject to extensive regulation of worker health and safety including the requirements of the us occupational safety and health act and similar laws of other jurisdictions in the us the operation of our mines is subject to regulation by the us mine safety and health administration msha under the federal mine safety and health act of 1977 mine act msha inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the mine act additionally in the us various state agencies have concurrent jurisdiction arising under state law that regulate worker health and safety in both our industrial facilities and mines if regulatory inspections result in an alleged violation we may be subject to fines and penalties and in instances of alleged significant violations our mining operations or industrial facilities could be subject to temporary or extended closures refer to exhibit 951 to this form 10k for additional information regarding certain orders and citations issued by msha for our operations during the year ended december 31 2021 for information about health and safety refer to “human capital” below and item 4 “mine safety disclosures” 

human rights 

we have adopted policies that govern our working relationships with the communities and governments where we operate and that are designed to guide our practices and programs in a manner that respects human rights and the culture of the local people impacted by our operations for information about human rights refer to “community and human rights” below 

competition 

the top 10 producers of copper comprise approximately 43 percent of total worldwide mined copper production for the year 2021 we ranked second among those producers with approximately seven percent of estimated total worldwide mined copper production our competitive position is based on the size quality and grade of our ore bodies and our ability to manage costs compared with other producers we have a diverse portfolio of mining operations with varying ore grades and cost structures our costs are driven by the location grade and nature of our ore bodies and the level of input costs including energy labor and equipment the metals markets are cyclical and our ability to maintain our competitive position over the long term is based on our ability to acquire and develop quality deposits hire and retain a skilled workforce and to manage our costs 

mining operations 

the copper mark 

we are committed to validating all of our copper producing sites including our mines and smelting and refining facilities with the copper mark a comprehensive assurance framework designed to demonstrate the copper industry’s responsible production practices to achieve the copper mark each site is required to complete an external assurance process to assess conformance with 32 environmental social and governance requirements as of december 31 2021 we had a total of seven sites that had been validated bagdad morenci miami el paso cerro verde el abra and atlantic copper and we have commenced the copper mark assessment process at four additional sites in north america chino tyrone safford and sierrita 

tailings management 

our tailings management and stewardship program which involves qualified external engineers of record and periodic oversight by independent tailings technical review boards and our tailings stewardship team complies with the tailings governance framework on preventing catastrophic failure of tailings storage facilities adopted in december 2016 by the international council on mining and metals icmm an industry group of which we are a founding member and required to be implemented by icmm members in august 2020 the coconveners of the global tailings review which included icmm published the global industry standard on tailings management the tailings standard the tailings standard includes 77 requirements across 6 key areas including the design construction operation and monitoring of tailings facilities management and governance emergency response and longterm recovery and public disclosure as a member of icmm we are committed to implementation of the 

tailings standard by august 2023 for priority tailings storage facilities and by august 2025 for our remaining facilities in line with the tailings standard requirementscommitments

description of indonesia ore bodies  our indonesia ore bodies are located within and around two main igneous intrusions the grasberg monzodiorite and the ertsberg diorite the host rocks of these ore bodies include both carbonate and clastic rocks that form the ridge crests and upper flanks of the sudirman range and the igneous rocks of monzonitic to dioritic composition that intrude them the igneoushosted ore bodies the grasberg block cave and portions of the dmlz occur as vein stockworks and disseminations of copper sulfides dominated by chalcopyrite and to a lesser extent bornite the sedimentaryrock hosted ore bodies portions of the dmlz and kucing liar and all of the big gossan occur as “magnetiterich calciummagnesian skarn” replacements whose location and orientation are strongly influenced by major faults and by the chemistry of the carbonate rocks along the margins of the intrusions 

the copper mineralization in these skarn deposits is dominated by chalcopyrite but higher bornite concentrations are common moreover gold occurs in significant concentrations in all of the district’s ore bodies though rarely visible to the naked eye these gold concentrations usually occur as inclusions within the copper sulfide minerals though in some deposits these concentrations can also be strongly associated with pyrite

pt smelting  pt smelting an indonesia company owns and operates a copper smelter and refinery in gresik indonesia on april 30 2021 ptfi acquired an additional 145 percent of the outstanding common stock of pt smelting for 33 million increasing its ownership interest to 395 percent mitsubishi materials corporation owns the remaining 605 percent 

in november 2021 ptfi completed agreements with mitsubishi materials corporation to implement the expansion of pt smelting’s capacity by 30 percent to 13 million metric tons of concentrate per year which is expected to be completed by the end of 2023 in connection with ptfi’s commitment to develop additional smelting capacity in indonesia refer to note 2 for discussion of ptfi’s loan to pt smelting 

ptfi’s contract with pt smelting provides for ptfi to supply 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements subject to a minimum or maximum treatment charge rate necessary for pt smelting to produce 205000 metric tons of copper annually on a priority basis ptfi may also sell copper concentrate to pt smelting at market rates for quantities in excess of 205000 metric tons of copper annually ptfi supplied 100 percent of pt smelting’s concentrate requirements in 2021 74 percent in 2020 and 90 percent in 2019 

in early 2017 the indonesia government issued new regulations to address exports of unrefined metals including copper concentrate and anode slimes and other matters related to the mining sector these regulations permit the export of anode slimes which is necessary for pt smelting to continue operating in december 2021 pt smelting received a twelvemonth extension of its anode slimes export license which currently expires december 9 2022 subject to review and approval by the indonesia government every six months refer to item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

pt smelting’s anode production from its smelter totaled 280400 metric tons of copper in 2021 276900 metric tons in 2020 and 246100 metric tons in 2019 copper cathode production from its refinery totaled 256900 metric tons of copper in 2021 273000 metric tons in 2020 and 241200 metric tons in 2019 

pt smelting’s maintenance turnarounds which range from two weeks to a month to complete typically are expected to occur approximately every two years with shortterm maintenance turnarounds in the interim pt smelting completed a 30day maintenance turnaround during december 2020 and the next major turnaround is scheduled for the second half of 2022 in addition pt smelting has a planned 75day shutdown scheduled for the first half of 2023 associated with its expansion project 

miami smelter  we own and operate a smelter at our miami mining operation in arizona the smelter has been operating for over 100 years and has been upgraded numerous times during that period to implement new technologies improve production and comply with air quality requirements 

the miami smelter processes copper concentrate primarily from our north america copper mines concentrate processed through the smelter totaled 674000 metric tons in 2021 764000 metric tons in 2020 and 641000 metric tons in 2019 in addition because sulfuric acid is a byproduct of smelting concentrate the miami smelter is also the most significant source of sulfuric acid for our north america leaching operations 

major maintenance turnarounds are anticipated to occur approximately every two or three years for the miami smelter we performed a major maintenance turnaround during 2021 the next major maintenance turnaround is scheduled for the first half of 2024   

rod  refining operations  our rod  refining operations consist of conversion facilities located in north america including a refinery in el paso texas and rod mills in el paso texas and miami arizona we refine our copper anode production from our miami smelter at our el paso refinery the el paso refinery has the potential to operate at an annual production capacity of about 900 million pounds of copper cathode which is sufficient to refine all of the copper anode we produce at our miami smelter our el paso refinery also produces nickel carbonate copper telluride and autoclaved slimes material containing gold silver platinum and palladium 

molybdenum conversion facilities  we process molybdenum concentrate at our conversion plants in the us and europe into such products as technicalgrade molybdic oxide ferromolybdenum pure molybdic oxide ammonium molybdates and molybdenum disulfide we operate molybdenum roasters in sierrita arizona fort madison iowa and rotterdam the netherlands and we operate a molybdenum pressureleach plant in bagdad arizona we also produce ferromolybdenum for customers worldwide at our conversion plant located in stowmarket united kingdom 

other north america copper mines  we have five nonoperating copper mines  ajo bisbee tohono twin buttes and christmas which are located in arizona  that have been on care and maintenance status for several years and would require new or updated environmental studies new permits and additional capital investment which could be significant to return them to operating status 

mining development projects and exploration activities 

capital expenditures totaled 21 billion including 125 billion for major projects and 02 billion for indonesia smelter projects in 2021 20 billion including 12 billion for major projects and 01 billion for indonesia smelter projects in 2020 and 265 billion including 15 billion for major projects in 2019 capital expenditures for major projects during 2021 2020 and 2019 were primarily associated with underground development activities in the grasberg minerals district and the lone star copper leach project at our safford mine which was completed in the second half of 2020 refer to mda for projected capital expenditures for the year 2022 

we have several projects and potential opportunities to expand production volumes extend mine lives and develop largescale underground ore bodies as further discussed in mda our nearterm major development projects will focus on the underground development activities in the grasberg minerals district considering the longterm nature and large size of our development projects actual costs and timing could vary from estimates additionally in response to market conditions the timing of our expenditures will continue to be reviewed we continue to review our mine development and processing plans to maximize the value of our mineral reserves 

additionally full development of ptfi’s underground mineral reserves at the grasberg minerals district is expected to require approximately 3 billion most of which will be incurred over an approximate 12year period of capital expenditures at our processing facilities to optimize the handling of underground ore from the grasberg block cave dmlz and kucing liar deposits increases in power loads at these processing facilities and the underground mines are expected to require additional power generation with capital expenditures approximating 06 billion for new dualfuel power generation upgrades to existing transmission lines and refurbishment of the existing three coal units 

our mining exploration activities are primarily associated with our existing mines focusing on opportunities to expand mineral reserves and mineral resources to support development of additional future production capacity exploration results continue to indicate opportunities for significant future potential reserve additions at our existing properties in north america and south america exploration spending associated with mining operations totaled 50 million in 2021 34 million in 2020 and 77 million in 2019 

refer to item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion of risks associated with mine development projects and exploration activities and ptfi’s iupk 

sources and availability of energy natural resources and raw materials 

our copper mining operations require significant amounts of energy principally diesel electricity coal and natural gas most of which is obtained from third parties under longterm contracts energy represented approximately 21 percent of our copper mine site operating costs in 2021 including purchases of approximately 220 million gallons of diesel fuel approximately 8000 gigawatt hours of electricity at our north america and south america copper mining operations we generate all of our power at our indonesia mining operation approximately 750 thousand metric tons of coal for our coal power plant in indonesia and approximately 1 million mmbtu million british thermal units of natural gas at certain of our north america mines based on current cost estimates energy is expected to approximate 25 percent of our copper mine site operating costs in 2022 

our mining operations also require significant quantities of water for mining ore processing and related support facilities the loss of water rights for any of our mines in whole or in part or shortages of water to which we have rights could require us to curtail or shut down mining operations for a further discussion of risks and legal proceedings associated with the availability of water refer to “governmental regulations” above item 1a “risk factors” and item 3 “legal proceedings” 

sulfuric acid is used in the sxew process and is produced as a byproduct of the smelting process at our smelters and from our sulfur burners at the safford mine sulfuric acid needs in excess of the sulfuric acid produced by our operations are purchased from third parties 

human capital 

we are committed to promoting the health safety and wellbeing of our workforce and striving to further strengthen our commitment to promoting an inclusive diverse and agile workplace we believe our global workforce is the foundation of our success our board of directors board oversees our policies and implementation programs that govern our approach to management of our human capital with the board’s corporate responsibility committee having oversight of health and safety matters and the board’s compensation committee having oversight of other human capital matters including those relating to workforce recruitment retention and development pay equity and inclusion and diversity 

workforce

our objective is to achieve zero workplace fatalities and to decrease injuries and occupational illnesses we measure our safety performance through regularly established benchmarks including our companywide total recordable incident rate trir which includes both employees and contractors in 2021 regrettably we had 3 workplace fatal events 2 work related and 1 not yet classified as either an independent medical episode or work related and 17 potential fatal events pfes compared to 5 fatalities and 12 pfes in 2020 overall the percentage of high risk incidents has trended down from 11 percent in 2019 to 7 percent in 2020 and 2021 our trir per 200000 manhours worked was 069 in both 2021 and 2020 meeting our 2021 and 2020 targets the metal mining sector industry average per 200000 manhours worked reported by msha was 170 for 2021 preliminary for the period of january 1 2021 through september 30 2021 and 166 in 2020 

in 2021 we continued to take steps to protect our workforce from covid19 including by continuing operating protocols at each of our operating sites to contain and mitigate the risk of spread of covid19 we will continue to monitor assess and update our covid19 response and to provide assistance to employees in obtaining vaccinations we are committed to the communities where we operate and continue to work closely with them including providing monetary support and inkind contributions of medical supplies and food to support our 

employees around the world we adjusted our policies for sick leave and other pay practices to encourage ill employees to stay home we also implemented a policy to allow those who can work remotely to do so during the pandemic and looking beyond we have committed to maintaining health benefits and offer guidance resources to support mental and physical wellbeing 

employee engagement training and development 

we operate in regions of varying ethnic religious and cultural backgrounds and we often are the largest employer in our local communities a key to our success is the ability to recruit retain develop and advance talented employees with diverse perspectives 

in addition to the health safety and wellbeing of our global workforce we have prioritized a flexible highly engaged and agile workforce the covid19 pandemic has amplified our focus on the need for and receptivity to innovation across all facets of the business particularly in how we communicate engage and collaborate across our global workforce in a more virtual environment 

we are committed to ongoing training and development of our workforce we focus on attracting and retaining talented people by offering quality employment with competitive compensation and benefits as well as opportunities for professional development and growth strategic talent reviews and succession planning occur regularly and across all business areas to support the advancement of our employees we offer training and development programs encouraging advancement from within and continue to promote strong and experienced management talent we leverage both formal and informal programs to identify foster and retain top talent at both the corporate and operations levels 

additionally hiring locally is a commitment we make to the communities surrounding our operations and to our host countries most people employed at our operations are host country nationals we retain expatriate expertise for managerial and technical roles only when it is not available in local communities to further these efforts expatriates receive cultural training upon their arrival to a new location

refer to item 1a “risk factors” for further information on human capital matters 

community and human rights 

we have adopted policies that govern our working relationships with the communities where we operate and that are designed to guide our practices and programs in a manner that respects human rights and the culture of the local people impacted by our operations 

we continue to make significant expenditures on community development health education training and cultural programs which include 

• comprehensive job training programs 

• clean water and sanitation projects 

• public health programs including malaria control and human immunodeficiency virus 

• agricultural assistance programs 

• small and medium enterprise development programs 

• basic education programs 

• cultural promotion and preservation programs 

• community infrastructure development 

• charitable donations 

in 2000 we endorsed the joint us state departmentbritish foreign office voluntary principles on human rights and security voluntary principles we participated in developing these voluntary principles with other major natural resource companies and international human rights organizations and they are incorporated into our human rights policy the voluntary principles provide guidelines for our security programs including interaction with hostgovernment security personnel private security contractors and our internal security employees 

our human rights policy most recently updated in december 2020 reflects our commitment to implementing the united nations guiding principles on business and human rights we have embarked on a program to plan and conduct sitelevel human rights impact assessments hria at our global operations 

hrias help us to embed human rights considerations into our business practices including sitelevel sustainable development risk registers we completed a hria at our cerro verde operation in peru in 2017 and at our new mexico mining operations in 2018 during 2021 we substantially completed a hria at our el abra operations in chile and began a comprehensive hria for all of our arizona sites including morenci bagdad safford sierrita and miami which we expect to complete in the first half of 2022 we also participate in a multiindustry human rights working group to gain insight from peer companies and experts in the field to learn how best practices are evolving 

we believe that our social and economic development programs are responsive to the issues raised by the local communities near our areas of operation and help us maintain good relations with the surrounding communities and avoid disruptions of mining operations as part of our ongoing commitment to our community stakeholders we have made and expect to continue making investments in certain social programs including inkind support and administration across our global operations from time to time over the last three years these investments have averaged 124 million per year nevertheless social and political instability in the areas of our operations may adversely impact our mining operations refer to item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

south america  cerro verde has provided a variety of community support projects over the years following engagements with regional and local governments civic leaders and development agencies in 2006 cerro verde committed to support the costs for a new potable water treatment plant to serve arequipa in addition an agreement was reached with the peru government for development of a water storage network that was financed by cerro verde and a distribution network that was financed by the cerro verde civil association 

cerro verde reached an agreement with the regional government of arequipa the national government the local water utility company and other local institutions to allow it to finance engineer and construct a wastewater treatment plant for the city of arequipa which was completed in 2015 the wastewater treatment plant supplements existing water supplies to support cerro verde’s concentrator expansion and also improves the local water quality enhances agriculture products grown in the area and reduces the risk of waterborne illnesses in addition to these projects cerro verde annually makes significant community development investments in the arequipa region 

security matters  consistent with our operating permits in peru and our commitment to protect our employees and property we have taken steps to provide a safe and secure working environment as part of its security program cerro verde maintains its own internal security department both employees and contractors perform functions such as protecting company facilities monitoring shipments of supplies and products assisting in traffic control and aiding in emergency response operations the security department receives human rights and voluntary principles training annually some contractors assigned to protection of expatriate personnel are armed these contractors also receive training in defensive driving and firearms handling cerro verde’s costs for its internal civilian security department totaled 7 million in both 2021 and 2020 and 9 million in 2019 

cerro verde like all businesses and residents of peru relies on the peru government for the maintenance of public order upholding the rule of law and the protection of personnel and property the peru government is responsible for employing police personnel and directing their operations cerro verde has limited public security forces in support of its operation with the arrangement defined through a memorandum of understanding with the peru national police cerro verde’s share of support costs for governmentprovided security approximated 1 million in each of the years 2021 2020 and 2019 

indonesia  in 1996 ptfi established the freeport partnership fund for community development the partnership fund through which ptfi has made available funding and technical assistance to support community development initiatives in the areas of health education economic development and local infrastructure ptfi has committed to provide funding based on a percentage of its revenues through 2041 for the development of the local communities in its area of operations through the partnership fund ptfi incurred costs of 75 million in 2021 36 million in 2020 and 28 million in 2019 for this commitment 

throughout 2019 ptfi consulted with key stakeholders to restructure the management of the partnership fund in compliance with ptfi’s iupk throughout this process ptfi continued its contributions to ensure no disruptions in implementation of approved projects beginning in february 2020 the partnership fund is now managed by a legally recognized indonesia foundation  yayasan pemberdayaan masyarakat amungme dan kamoro or ypmak ypmak is governed by a board of governors consisting of seven representatives including four from ptfi 

in addition to the partnership fund ptfi has made and expects to continue making annual investments in public health education community infrastructure and local economic development 

security matters    consistent with our ongoing commitment to protect our employees and property we have taken steps to provide a safe and secure working environment as part of its security program ptfi maintains its own internal civilian security department both employees and contractors are unarmed and perform functions such as protecting company facilities monitoring shipments of supplies and products assisting in traffic control and aiding in emergency response operations the security department receives human rights training annually 

ptfi’s costs for its internal civilian security department totaled 50 million in 2021 47 million in 2020 and 52 million in 2019 

ptfi like all businesses and residents of indonesia relies on the indonesia government for the maintenance of public order upholding the rule of law and protection of personnel and property the grasberg minerals district has been designated by the indonesia government as one of indonesia’s vital national assets this designation results in the police and to a lesser extent the military playing a significant role in protecting the area of our operations the indonesia government is responsible for employing police and military personnel and directing their operations 

from the outset of ptfi’s operations the indonesia government has looked to ptfi to provide logistical and infrastructure support and assistance for these necessary services because of the limited resources of the indonesia government and the remote location of and lack of development in papua ptfi’s financial support of the indonesia government security institutions assigned to ptfi’s operations area represents a prudent response to ptfi’s requirements and commitments to protect its workforce and property better ensuring that personnel are properly fed and lodged and have the logistical resources to patrol ptfi’s roads and secure its area of operations in addition the provision of such support is consistent with our philosophy of responsible corporate citizenship and reflects our commitment to pursue practices that protect and respect human rights 

ptfi’s support costs for the governmentprovided security totaled 25 million in 2021 and 22 million in both 2020 and 2019 this supplemental support consists of various infrastructure and other costs including food housing fuel travel vehicle repairs allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs and community assistance programs conducted by the military and police

mineral reserves 

our estimates of mineral reserves have been prepared in accordance with the disclosure requirements of sk 1300 proven and probable mineral reserves were determined from the application of relevant modifying factors to geological data in order to establish an operational economically viable mine plan the estimates are based on mapping drilling sampling assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry mineral reserves as used in the mineral reserve data presented here means the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated resource which includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined or extracted proven mineral reserves mean the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource from geological evidence revealed in outcrops trenches workings or drill holes with grades andor quality estimates from detailed closelyspaced sampling and geologic characterization that defines the size shape depth and mineral content to a high degree of confidence probable mineral reserves means the economically mineable part of an indicated mineral resource for which quantity and grade are estimated from information similar to that used for measured mineral resources where the samples are farther apart and the geological characterization is adequate probable mineral reserves can also include remaining portions of a measured mineral resource the degree of assurance although lower than that for proven mineral reserves is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 

our estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves are prepared by and are the responsibility of our employees these estimates are reviewed and verified regularly by independent experts in mining geology and reserve determination our mineral reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies we conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk we revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies refer to item 1a “risk factors” for discussion of risks associated with our estimates of proven and probable mineral reserves 

estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves at december 31 2021 were determined using metals price assumptions of 250 per pound for copper 1200 per ounce for gold and 10 per pound for molybdenum for the threeyear period ended december 31 2021 lme copper settlement prices averaged 325 per pound london pm gold prices averaged 1654 per ounce and the weekly average price for molybdenum quoted by metals week averaged 1197 per pound 

the estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves presented in the table below represent the estimated metal quantities from which we expect to be paid after application of estimated metallurgical recoveries and smelter recoveries where applicable 



a estimated consolidated recoverable copper reserves include 18 billion pounds in leach stockpiles and 03 billion pounds in mill stockpiles refer to “mill and leach stockpiles” for further discussion

the table below summarizes changes in estimated recoverable copper gold and molybdenum in mineral reserves between december 31 2020 and 2021 for our properties identified as material under sk 1300 



a the downward adjustments at morenci are primarily the result of revised mine designs partly offset by increased crushed leach recovery and rerouting of ore types the upward adjustments at cerro verde are primarily the result of updated resource modeling and revised mine designs partly offset by mine scheduling strategy and nearterm recovery assumptions the adjustments at grasberg minerals district are primarily the result of revised mine designs and mine schedule changes 

in defining our openpit mineral reserves we apply a “variable cutoff grade” strategy the objective of this strategy is to maximize the net present value of our operations we use a “breakeven cutoff grade” to define the insitu mineral reserves for our underground ore bodies the breakeven cutoff grade is defined for a metric ton of ore as that equivalent copper grade once produced and sold that generates sufficient revenue to cover all operating and administrative costs associated with our production 

our copper mines may contain other commercially recoverable metals such as gold molybdenum and silver we value all commercially recoverable metals in terms of a copper equivalent percentage to determine a single cutoff grade copper equivalent percentage is used to express the relative value of multimetal ores in terms of one metal the calculation expresses the relative value of the ore using estimates of contained metal quantities metals prices as used for reserve determination recovery rates treatment charges and royalties our molybdenum properties use a molybdenum cutoff grade 

the table below shows the minimum cutoff grade for mineral reserves by process for each of our existing ore bodies as of december 31 2021 



production sequencing 

the following chart illustrates our current plans for sequencing and producing our proven and probable mineral reserves at each of our ore bodies and the years in which we currently expect production from each ore body and related stockpiles our proven and probable mineral reserves in indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041 and our current mine plan and planned operations are based on the assumption that ptfi will comply with its obligations under the iupk and receive the second 10year extension from 2031 through 2041 refer to item 1a “risk factors” and note 13 for further discussion we develop our mine plans based on maximizing the net present value from the ore bodies significant additional capital expenditures will be required at many of these mines in order to achieve the lifeofmine plans reflected below 

a development commenced in october 2021 the ultimate timing of the start of production is dependent upon a number of factors and may vary from the date shown here 

mill and leach stockpiles 

mill and leach stockpiles generally contain lower grade ores that have been extracted from an ore body and are available for metal recovery mill stockpiles contain sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through milling concentrating smelting and refining or alternatively by concentrate leaching leach stockpiles contain oxide ores and certain secondary sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities 

because it is impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count reasonable estimation methods are employed the quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grades of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles 

expected copper recoveries for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing the recoverable copper in mill stockpiles once entered into the production process can be produced into copper concentrate almost immediately 

expected copper recoveries for leach stockpiles are determined using smallscale laboratory tests small to largescale column testing which simulates the production process historical trends and other factors including mineralogy of the ore and rock type total copper recovery in leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low percentage to more than 90 percent depending on several variables including processing methodology processing variables mineralogy and particle size of the rock for newly placed material on active stockpiles as much as 80 percent of total copper recovery may be extracted during the first year and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years processes and recoveries are monitored regularly and recovery estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes 

following are our stockpiles and the estimated recoverable copper contained within those stockpiles as of december 31 2021 



a totals may not foot because of rounding 

b rounds to less than 01 billion pounds of recoverable copper 

c consolidated stockpiles represent estimated metal quantities after reduction for morenci’s joint venture partner interests refer to note 3 for further discussion

our estimates of mineral resources have been prepared in accordance with the disclosure requirements of sk 1300 as a result of the sec’s revised disclosure requirements for mining registrants we replaced our estimate of mineralized material with an estimate of mineral resources including measured indicated and inferred resources in accordance with the disclosure requirements of sk 1300  we hold various properties containing mineral resources in addition to mineral reserves that we believe could be brought into production should market conditions warrant however permitting and significant capital expenditures may be required before mining of these resources could commence at these properties a mineral resource is a concentration or occurrence of material of economic interest in such form grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for economic extraction such a deposit cannot qualify as recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves until engineering legal and economic feasibility are confirmed based upon a comprehensive evaluation of development and operating costs grades recoveries and other material factors mineral resources include measured indicated and inferred mineral classifications a measured mineral resource is a resource for which the quantity and grade are estimated from detailed closelyspaced sampling and geologic characterization that defines the size shape depth and mineral content to a high degree of confidence an indicated mineral resource is a resource for which quantity and grade are estimated from information similar to that used for measured mineral resources where the samples are farther apart and the geological characterization is adequate an inferred mineral resource is a resource for which quantity and grade are estimated from information similar to that used for measured and indicated mineral resources but with limited geological evidence and sampling inferred mineral resource grade and mineralization continuity have a lower degree of confidence accordingly no assurance can be given that the estimated mineral resources not included in mineral reserves will become proven and probable mineral reserves estimated mineral resources as presented on the following pages were assessed using prices of 300 per pound for copper 1200 per ounce for gold 12 per pound for molybdenum and 20 per ounce for silver cutoff grade strategy and expected recoveries used to evaluate mineral resources are consistent with those for mineral reserves but would require additional work to substantiate refer to item 1a “risk factors” for discussion of risks associated with our estimates of mineral resources

the table below summarizes changes in estimated contained copper gold and molybdenum in mineral resources between december 31 2020 and 2021 for our properties identified as material under sk 1300 



a the upward adjustments at morenci are primarily the result of lower estimated unit costs coupled with revised mine designs the downward adjustments at cerro verde are primarily the result of converting material from mineral resources to mineral reserves in the revised mineral reserves mine designs the downward adjustments at the grasberg minerals district are primarily the result of revised mine designs and a higher cutoff grade 

internal controls over the mineral reserves and mineral resources estimation process 

we have internal controls over the mineral reserves and mineral resources estimation processes that result in reasonable and reliable estimates aligned with industry practice and reporting regulations annually qualified persons and other employees review the estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources the supporting documentation and compliance to the internal controls and based on their review of such information recommend approval to use the mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates to our senior management our controls utilize management systems including but not limited to formal quality assurance and quality control protocols standardized procedures workflow processes supervision and management approval internal and external reviews and audits reconciliations and data security covering record keeping chain of custody and data storage 

our systems also cover exploration activities sample preparation and analysis data verification mineral processing metallurgical testing recovery estimation mine design and sequencing and mineral reserve and resource evaluations with environmental social and regulatory considerations our quality assurance and control protocols over sampling and assaying of drill hole samples include insertion of blind samples consisting of standards blanks and duplicates in the primary sample streams as well as selective sample validation at secondary laboratories 

these controls and other methods help to validate the reasonableness of the estimates the effectiveness of the controls are reviewed periodically to address changes in conditions and the degree of compliance with policies and procedures refer to item 1a “risk factors” for discussion of risks associated with our estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources

financial risks 

fluctuations in the market prices of the commodities we produce have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in our financial performance and in the trading prices of our common stock extended material declines in the market prices of such commodities could adversely affect our financial condition 

our financial results vary with fluctuations in the market prices of the commodities we produce primarily copper and gold and to a lesser extent molybdenum extended material declines in market prices of such commodities could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and the value of our assets may depress the price of our common stock and may have a material adverse effect on our ability to comply with financial and other covenants in our debt agreements repay our debt and meet our other obligations during 2020 the covid19 pandemic and resulting negative impact on the global economy created significant volatility in the financial markets including the copper market copper prices were initially impacted by economic uncertainty however in mid2020 copper prices began to rise and reached a record high during 2021 despite the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

fluctuations in commodities prices are caused by varied and complex factors beyond our control including global supply and demand and inventory levels global economic and political conditions international regulatory trade andor tax policies including national tariffs commodities investment activity and speculation interest rates expectations regarding future inflation rates the strength of the us dollar compared to foreign currencies the price and availability of substitute products and changes in technology volatility in global economic growth particularly in developing economies has the potential to adversely affect future demand and prices for commodities geopolitical uncertainty and protectionism have the potential to inhibit international trade and negatively impact business confidence which creates the risk of constraints on our ability to trade in certain markets and has the potential to increase price volatility 

in addition to the factors discussed above copper prices may be affected by demand from china which is currently the largest consumer of refined copper in the world for infrastructure the growing markets for automobiles and appliances and by the global focus on a transition to new technologies for clean energy to advance communications and to enhance public health as well as demand from north america europe and asian countries other than china additional factors affecting gold prices may include purchases and sales of gold by governments and central banks demand from china and india two of the world’s largest consumers of gold and global demand for jewelry containing gold for additional information regarding the historical fluctuations of the prices of copper gold and molybdenum refer to “markets” in mda 

if market prices for the primary commodities we produce were to materially decline and remain low for a sustained period of time we may have to revise our operating plans including curtailing or modifying our mining and processing operations as we had to do in early 2020 in response to the global covid19 pandemic we may be unable to decrease our costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues in which case we may incur losses and those losses may be material 

declines in prices of commodities we sell could also result in metals inventory adjustments and impairment charges for our longlived assets refer to note 4 for additional information regarding metals inventory adjustments recorded for the three years ended december 31 2021 other events that could result in impairment of our longlived assets include but are not limited to decreases in estimated proven and probable mineral reserves and any event that might have a material adverse effect on current and future expected mine production costs 

our debt and other financial commitments may limit our financial and operating flexibility 

at december 31 2021 our total consolidated debt was 95 billion see mda and note 8 and our total consolidated cash and cash equivalents was 81 billion we also have various other financial commitments including reclamation and environmental obligations takeorpay contracts and leases for further information see the risk factor below relating to mine closure and reclamation regulations although we have been successful in repaying debt in the past refinancing our bank facilities and issuing new debt securities in capital markets transactions there can be no assurance that we can continue to do so see the risk factor below regarding increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from stakeholders including creditors with respect to our esg practices performance and disclosures in addition we or our subsidiaries may incur additional debt in future periods or reduce our holdings of cash and cash equivalents in connection with funding existing operations capital expenditures dividends share repurchases or in pursuing other business opportunities 

our level of indebtedness and other financial commitments could have important consequences to our business including the following 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the industry in which we operate 

• increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic industry and regulatory conditions 

• limiting our ability to fund future working capital capital expenditures general corporate requirements andor material contingencies to engage in future development activities or to otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt 

• requiring us to sell assets to reduce debt or 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt andor fewer financial commitments 

any failure to comply with the financial andor other covenants in our debt agreements may result in an event of default that would allow the creditors to accelerate maturities of the related debt which in turn may trigger crossacceleration or crossdefault provisions in other debt agreements our available cash and liquidity may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our debt instruments that may be accelerated upon an event of default 

as of january 31 2022 our senior unsecured debt was rated “baa3” with a stable outlook by moody’s investors service “bbb” with a stable outlook by fitch ratings and “bb” with a stable outlook by standard  poor’s if we are unable to maintain our indebtedness and financial ratios at levels acceptable to these credit rating agencies or should our business prospects deteriorate our current credit ratings could be downgraded which could adversely affect the value of our outstanding securities and existing debt our ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms and could increase our borrowing costs 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic and any future major public health crisis may have an adverse impact on our business 

since early 2020 the covid19 pandemic has significantly impacted economic activity and markets throughout the world the extent and duration of adverse impacts that the covid19 pandemic including new and emerging strains and variants or any future major public health crisis may have on our operations and business including demand for the commodities we produce and on global financial markets remains uncertain our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively including because of illness quarantines government actions or other restrictions despite our efforts to manage the impacts of the pandemic there can be no assurance that our actions will be effective in containing and mitigating the risk of spread or a major outbreak of covid19 or any future major public health crisis at our operating sites additionally although several vaccines for covid19 have been approved there are risks that these vaccines will not be effective against new and emerging strains and variants of the virus and that these vaccines may not be widely available or accepted in the areas in which we operate a major outbreak of covid19 or any future major public health crisis at any of our operating sites and particularly at ptfi’s remote operating site could disrupt or change our operating plans which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

actions taken by governmental authorities and third parties to contain and mitigate the risk of spread of covid19 and those that may be taken for any future major public health crisis have impacted and may in the future negatively impact our business for example in midmarch 2020 the peru government issued a supreme decree and declaration of a national emergency in its efforts to contain the outbreak of covid19 to comply with the government’s requirements in 2020 we temporarily transitioned our cerro verde mine to care and maintenance status and adjusted operations to prioritize critical activities these and other impacts of covid19 or any future major public health crisis had or could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

changes in or the failure to comply with the requirements of mine closure and reclamation regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are required by us federal and state laws and regulations to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans for our mining properties if we are unable to do so as of december 31 2021 our financial assurance obligations totaled 15 billion for closure and reclamationrestoration costs of us mining sites refer to note 12 for additional information regarding our financial assurance obligations and items 1 and 2 “business and properties” for a discussion of certain of such us federal and state laws and regulations applicable to freeportmcmoran inc fcx a substantial portion of our financial assurance obligations are satisfied by fcx and subsidiary guarantees our ability to continue to provide guarantees depends on state and other regulatory requirements our financial performance and our financial condition other forms of assurance such as letters of credit and surety bonds are costly to provide and depending on our financial condition and market conditions may be difficult or impossible to obtain failure to provide the required financial assurance could result in the closure of the affected properties 

plans and provisions for mine closure and remediation may change over time due to changes in stakeholder expectations legislation standards and technical understanding and techniques which may cause our provisions for environmental and asset retirement obligations to be underestimated and could materially affect our financial position or results of operations for example our implementation of the global industry standard for tailings management the tailings standard discussed in items 1 and 2 “business and properties” herein could require 

changes to our closure and reclamation plans although it is uncertain if these changes would result in material capital or operating cost increases in addition climate change could lead to changes in the physical risks posed to our operations which could result in changes in our closure and reclamation plans to address such risks any modifications to our closure and reclamation plans that may be required to address physical climate risks may materially increase the costs associated with implementing closure and reclamation at any or all of our active or inactive mine sites and the financial assurance obligations related to the same refer to notes 1 and 12 for further discussion of our environmental and asset retirement obligations and see the risk factor below relating to the physical impacts of climate change 

unanticipated litigation or negative developments in pending litigation changes in income tax laws or other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

we are and may in the future become involved in various legal proceedings and subject to other contingencies that have arisen or may arise in the ordinary course of our business or are associated with environmental matters including those described in note 12 and in item 3 “legal proceedings” we are also involved periodically in other reviews inquiries investigations and other proceedings initiated by or involving government agencies some of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief from time to time we are involved in disputes over the allocation of environmental remediation obligations at “superfund” and other sites in addition we may be held responsible for the costs of addressing contamination at the site of current or former activities or at third party sites or be held liable to third parties for exposure to hazardous substances should those be identified in the future the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant monetary damages penalties other sanctions or injunctive relief against us limitations on our property rights or regulatory interpretations that increase our operating costs management does not believe based on currently available information that the outcome of any individual legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition although individual or cumulative outcomes could be material to our operating results for a particular period depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period 

regardless of the merit of particular claims defending against litigation or responding to investigations can be expensive timeconsuming disruptive to our operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations we may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges there can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur 

further we are a global business with operations in various jurisdictions in the event of a dispute arising at our foreign operations we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the us or in enforcing the judgment of a foreign court or arbitral panel against a sovereign nation our inability to enforce our right and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels including against a sovereign nation could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

we have significant net operating losses nols in the us generated in prior years these nols are available to offset future taxable income resulting in minimal estimated tax liability in the us over the next several years at current metals market prices changes to us income tax laws andor recommendations from the organization for economic cooperation and development regarding a global minimum income tax and other changes being considered andor implemented in countries where we operate could materially impact our income tax provision cash tax liability and effective tax rate in addition these changes may result in new limitations on our ability to benefit from our significant us nols 

international risks 

our international operations are subject to geopolitical economic and social risks 

we are a usbased mining company with substantial assets located outside of the us risks of conducting business in countries outside the us can include 

• delays in obtaining or renewing or the inability to obtain maintain or renew or the renegotiation cancellation revocation or forced modification including the inherent risk of these actions being taken unilaterally by government owned entities of contracts leases licenses permits stability agreements or other agreements andor approvals 

• expropriation or nationalization of property protectionism or restrictions on repatriation of earnings or capital 

• changes in and differing interpretations of the host country’s laws regulations and policies which may be applied retroactively including but not limited to those relating to labor taxation royalties duties tariffs divestment imports exports including restrictions on the export of copper concentrate and anode slimes copper andor gold trade regulations immigration currency and environmental matters including land use and water use additional requirements on foreign operations and investment andor result in fines fees and sanctions imposed for failure to comply with the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate the risk of any of which may increase with rising “resource nationalism” in countries around the world 

• geopolitical social and economic instability bribery extortion corruption civil unrest blockades acts of war guerrilla activities insurrection and terrorism certain of which may result in among other things an inability to access our property or transport our commodities and in particular our investments and operations in peru and chile currently may be susceptible to such risks 

• risk of loss associated with trespass illegal artisanal mining theft sabotage and vandalism 

• risk of loss due to major public health issues including any pandemic such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic epidemic or endemic health issues as a result of the potential related impact to employees disruptions to operations supply chain delays trade restrictions and impact on economic activity in affected countries or regions and due to the limitations of certain local health systems and infrastructure to contain such major public health issues see above for further discussion of our risks specific to the covid19 pandemic 

• changes in us trade tariff tax immigration or other policies that may harm relations with foreign countries or result in retaliatory policies 

• increases in training and other costs and challenges relating to requirements by governmental entities to employ the nationals of the country in which a particular operation is located 

• foreign exchange controls fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and inflation and 

• reduced protection for intellectual property rights 

our insurance does not cover most losses caused by the above described risks for example we do not have political risk insurance accordingly our exploration development and production activities outside of the us may be substantially affected by many unpredictable factors beyond our control some of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

we are required to comply with a wide range of laws and regulations in the countries where we operate or do business for example our international operations must comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption and antibribery laws of the other jurisdictions in which we operate we operate in jurisdictions that have experienced public and private sector corruption and where significant anticorruption enforcement activities prosecutions and settlements have occurred we have a large number of contracts with local and foreign suppliers and contractors who may take action contrary to or fail to adopt standards controls and procedures including health safety environment human rights and community standards that are equivalent to our standards controls and procedures there can be no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from misinterpretation of or noncompliance with applicable laws and internal policies recklessness fraudulent behavior dishonesty or other inappropriate acts committed by our affiliates employees agents suppliers or contractors as such our corporate policies and processes may not prevent or detect all potential breaches of law 

or governance practices any such breaches could result in safety events that may result in injuries or fatalities significant criminal or civil fines and penalties litigation or regulatory action or inquiries shareholder activism such as to stop using a certain supplier or contractor civil unrest or other adverse impacts on human rights and loss of operating licenses or permits and may damage our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

we conduct international mining operations in indonesia peru and chile and exploration activities in other foreign jurisdictions accordingly in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in countries outside the us our business may be adversely affected by political economic social and regional uncertainties in each of these countries for example we are involved in several significant tax proceedings and other tax disputes with indonesia and peru tax authorities refer to note 12 for further discussion of these matters other risks specific to certain countries in which we operate are discussed in more detail below 

because our mining operations in indonesia are a significant operating asset our business may be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties in indonesia 

maintaining a good working relationship with the indonesia government and pt indonesia asahan aluminium persero pt inalum also known as mind id an indonesia stateowned enterprise and shareholder in ptfi is important because of the significance of our indonesia operations to our business and because our mining operations there are among indonesia’s most significant business enterprises partially because of the grasberg minerals district’s significance to indonesia’s economy the environmentally sensitive area where it is located and the number of people employed our indonesia operations have been the subject of political debates and criticism in the indonesia press and have been the target of protests and occasional violence improper management of our working relationship with the indonesia government could lead to a disruption of operations andor impact our reputation in indonesia and in the region where we operate which could adversely affect our business 

the mining industry is subject to extensive regulation within indonesia and there have been major developments in laws and regulations applicable to mining concession holders some of which have conflicted with ptfi’s contractual rights in the past in particular the enactment of law no 4 of 2009 on coal and mineral mining on january 12 2009 the mining law replaced the previous regulatory framework which allowed concession holders including ptfi to conduct mining activities in indonesia under a contract of work system notwithstanding provisions in ptfi’s former contract of work cow prohibiting it from doing so the indonesia government sought to modify ptfi’s former cow to address provisions contained in the mining law and implementing regulations adopted thereunder some of which were not required under or conflicted with ptfi’s former cow 

in early 2017 the indonesia government issued new regulations to address exports of unrefined metals including copper concentrate and anode slimes and other matters related to the mining sector ptfi’s export license for copper concentrate is valid for one year periods subject to review and approval by the indonesia government every six months depending on greenfield smelter development progress ptfi’s export license expires on march 15 2022 refer to mda and note 12 for further discussion of the administrative fine levied by the indonesia government on ptfi for failing to achieve physical development progress on the greenfield smelter and ongoing discussions with the indonesia government regarding a deferred schedule for the completion of the greenfield smelter in light of the ongoing covid19 pandemic the 2017 regulations also permit the export of anode slimes which is necessary for pt smelting ptfi’s 395percentowned copper smelter and refinery located in gresik indonesia to continue operating pt smelting’s export license for anode slimes expires on december 9 2022 subject to review and approval by the indonesia government every six months in addition to a delay in the renewal of its export license for anode slimes in 2017 pt smelting’s operations were shut down from midjanuary 2017 until early march 2017 as a result of labor disturbances copper concentrate sales to pt smelting totaled over 10 percent of our consolidated revenues for each of the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 we cannot predict when and if ptfi’s copper concentrate export license and pt smelting’s anode slimes export license may be renewed ptfi’s sale of concentrates could be interrupted if either of these export license is not timely renewed or if pt smelting is unable to operate either due to other operational or financial constraints which would adversely impact our revenues and operations 

we cannot assure you that future regulatory changes affecting the mining industry in indonesia will not be introduced or unexpectedly repealed or that new interpretations of existing laws and regulations will not be issued which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

ptfi will not mine all of the ore reserves in the grasberg minerals district before the initial term of its iupk expires in 2031 ptfi’s iupk may not be extended through 2041 if ptfi fails to abide by its terms and conditions and applicable laws and regulations 

on december 21 2018 ptfi was granted an iupk to replace its former cow enabling ptfi to conduct operations in the grasberg minerals district through 2041 under the terms of the iupk ptfi has been granted mining rights through 2031 with rights to extend its mining rights through 2041 subject to among other things ptfi’s completion of construction of additional domestic smelting capacity totaling 2 million metric tons of concentrate per year by the end of 2023 an extension of which has been requested due to covid19 mitigation measures subject to the approval of the indonesia government and fulfilling its defined fiscal obligations to the indonesia government refer to note 13 for a summary of the iupk’s key fiscal terms the expansion of pt smelting is expected to be complete in late 2023 and the construction of the greenfield smelter is expected to be completed as soon as feasible in 2024 which is subject to among other things no additional covid19 related disruptions 

the iupk also requires ptfi to pay duties on concentrate exports of 5 percent declining to 25 percent when development progress for additional smelting capacity in indonesia exceeds 30 percent and eliminated when development progress for additional smelting capacity in indonesia exceeds 50 percent refer to mda and note 12 for further discussion of the administrative fine levied by the indonesia government on ptfi for failing to achieve physical development progress on the greenfield smelter and ongoing discussions with the indonesia government regarding a deferred schedule for the completion of the greenfield smelter in light of the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

the preliminary capital cost estimate for the greenfield smelter and related precious metal refinery approximates 3 billion in july 2021 ptfi entered into a 10 billion fiveyear unsecured bank credit facility to advance its indonesia smelter projects and is currently arranging additional debt financing for these projects ptfi’s ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions and future market prices as well as ptfi’s operational performance cash flows and debt position among other factors financing may not be available when needed or if available the terms of such financing may not be favorable to ptfi see the risk factor below regarding increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from stakeholders including creditors with respect to our esg practices performance and disclosures 

our proven and probable mineral reserves in indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041 and ptfi’s current longterm mine plan and planned operations are based on the assumption that ptfi will abide by the terms and conditions of the iupk and will be granted the 10year extension from 2031 through 2041 as a result ptfi will not mine all of these mineral reserves during the initial term of the iupk prior to the end of 2031 we expect to mine 48 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable mineral reserves at december 31 2021 representing 53 percent of our net equity share of recoverable copper reserves and 55 percent of our net equity share of recoverable gold reserves 

if ptfi does not complete the construction of additional domestic smelting capacity totaling 2 million metric tons of concentrate per year by the end of 2023 an extension of which has been requested due to covid19 mitigation measures subject to the approval of the indonesia government or fulfill its defined fiscal obligations to the indonesia government as set forth in the iupk the iupk may not be extended from 2031 through 2041 and ptfi would be unable to mine all of the proven and probable mineral reserves in the grasberg minerals district which would adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position 

operational risks 

our mining operations are subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our business and our underground mining operations have higher risks than a surface mine 

we have assets in a variety of geographic locations all of which exist in and around broader communities and environments maintaining the operational integrity and performance of our assets is crucial to protect our people the environment and communities in which we operate our mines are very large in scale and by their nature are subject to significant operational risks some of which are outside of our control and many of which are not covered fully or in some cases even partially by insurance these operational risks which could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and cash flows include earthquakes rainstorms floods wildfires and other natural disasters environmental hazards including discharge of metals concentrates pollutants or hazardous chemicals surface or underground fires equipment failures accidents including in connection with mining 

equipment milling equipment or conveyor systems transportation of chemicals explosives or other materials and in the transportation of employees and business partners to and from sites including where these services are provided by third parties such as vehicle and aircraft transport wall failures and rock slides in our openpit mines and structural collapses of our underground mines or tailings impoundments underground water and ore management lower than expected ore grades or recovery rates and seismic activity resulting from unexpected or difficult geological formations or conditions whether in mineral or gaseous form as a result of the covid19 pandemic workplace entry and travel restrictions may result in the delay of key personnel or external consultants accessing our sites to undertake inspections or other activities potentially resulting in unidentified asset integrity 

for a discussion of risks specific to our tailings management see the risk factor below relating to our management of waste rock and tailings 

we are facing continued geotechnical challenges due to the older age of some of our openpit mines and a trend toward mining deeper pits and more complex deposits no assurances can be given that unanticipated geotechnical and hydrological conditions may or may not occur nor whether these conditions may lead to events such as landslides and pit wall failures in the future or that such events will be detected in advance geotechnical instabilities can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control such as seismic activity or severe weather which may lead to floods mudslides pitwall instability and possibly even slippage of material in early 2019 our el abra operation in chile experienced heavy rainfall and electrical storms as a result our operating results for 2019 were impacted by a suspension of el abra’s crushed leach stacking operations for approximately 35 days we cannot predict whether similar events will occur in the future or the extent to which any such event would affect this or any of our other operations 

our business is dependent upon our workforce being able to safely perform their jobs including the potential for physical injuries or illness underground mining operations can be particularly dangerous and in may 2013 a tragic accident which resulted in 28 fatalities and 10 injuries occurred at the grasberg minerals district when the rock structure above the ceiling of an underground training facility collapsed no assurance can be given that similar events will not occur in the future 

we experience mining induced seismic activity from time to time in the grasberg minerals district we cannot predict whether additional occurrences of seismic activity or other unexpected geological activity will occur that could cause schedule delays or additional revisions to ptfi’s mine plans which could adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry our indonesia mining operations involve additional risks given their location in steep mountainous terrain in a remote area of indonesia these conditions have required us to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities the area also receives extreme rainfall which has led to periodic floods and mudslides further the mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time 

we maintain insurance at amounts we believe to be reasonable to cover some of these risks and hazards however our insurance may not sufficiently cover losses from certain natural or operating disasters no assurance can be given that such insurance will continue to be available or that it will be available at economically feasible premiums or that we will be able to obtain or maintain such insurance we may elect to not purchase insurance for certain risks due to the high premium costs associated with insuring such risk or for various other reasons we do not have coverage for certain environmental losses and other risks the lack of or insufficiency of insurance coverage could adversely affect our cash flows and overall profitability 

the occurrence of one or more of these events in connection with our exploration activities and development of and production from mining operations may result in the death of or personal injury to our employees other personnel or third parties the loss of mining equipment damage to or destruction of mineral properties or production facilities significant repair costs monetary losses deferral or unanticipated fluctuations in production extensive community disruption including short and longterm health and safety risks loss of licenses permits or necessary approvals to operate loss of workforce confidence loss of infrastructure and services disruption to essential supplies or delivery of our products environmental damage and potential legal liabilities all of which may adversely affect our reputation business prospects results of operations and financial position further the impacts of any serious incidents that occur may also be amplified if we fail to respond timely or in an appropriate manner 

our management of waste rock and tailings are subject to significant environmental safety and engineering challenges and risks that could adversely affect our business 

the waste rock including overburden and tailings produced in our mining operations represent our largest volume of waste material managing the volume of waste rock and tailings presents significant environmental safety and engineering challenges and risks primarily relating to structural stability geochemistry water quality and dust generation management of this waste is regulated in the jurisdictions where we operate and our programs are designed to comply with applicable national state and local laws permits and approved environmental impact studies 

we maintain large leach pads and tailings impoundments containing viscous material tailings impoundments include large embankments that must be engineered constructed and monitored to ensure structural stability and avoid leakages or structural collapse our tailings impoundments in arid areas must have effective programs to suppress fugitive dust emissions and we must effectively monitor prevent and treat acid rock drainage at all of our operations in indonesia we use a river transport system for tailings management which presents other risks discussed in more detail in the risk factor below relating to the environmental challenges at our indonesia mining operations 

subsidiaries of our company currently operate 16 active tailings storage facilities 14 in the us and 2 in peru of which 11 have an upstream design and 5 have a centerline design we also manage 52 tailings storage facilities in the us that are inactive or closed 45 with an upstream design 5 with a centerline design and 2 with a downstream design and another 5 with an upstream design that are deemed “safely closed” according to the definition in the tailings standard in 2021 we produced approximately 295 million metric tons of tailings the failure of tailings and other embankments at any of our mining operations could cause severe and in some cases catastrophic property and environmental damage and loss of life as well as adverse effects on our business and reputation many of our tailings storage facilities are located in areas where a failure has the potential to impact individual dwellings and a limited number of impoundments are in areas where a failure has the potential to impact nearby communities or mining infrastructure as a result our programs take into account the significant consequences resulting from potential failure modes and we dedicate substantial financial resources and internal and external technical resources to pursue the safe management of all those facilities reducing and in some cases eliminating the number of and potential consequences of credible failure modes our tailings management and stewardship program involves qualified external engineers of record and periodic oversight by independent tailings technical review boards and our tailings stewardship team we continue to enhance our existing practices to strengthen the design operation and closure of tailings storage facilities in an effort to reduce the risk of severe or catastrophic failure of those facilities however no assurance can be given that these events will not occur in the future for additional information regarding the company’s tailings management and stewardship program including the tailings standard refer to items 1 and 2 “business and properties” herein 

in addition changes to the physical risks to our facilities resulting from climate change could lead to changes in our plans for managing tailings and waste rock in order to address such risks which may materially increase the costs associated with managing waste rock and tailings at any or all of our active or inactive mine sites for further discussion see the below risk factor relating to the physical effects of climate change 

based on observations from tailings failures at unaffiliated mines in addition to fatalities and severe personal property and environmental damages these events could result in limited or restricted access to mine sites suspension of operations decrease in mineral reserves legal liability government investigations additional regulations and restrictions on mining operations in response to any such failure increased monitoring costs and production costs increased insurance costs or inability to obtain insurance increased costs andor limited access to capital remediation costs inability to comply with any additional safety requirements or obtain necessary certifications evacuation or relocation of communities or other emergency action and other impacts which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position 

our indonesia mining operations have the potential to create difficult and costly environmental challenges and future changes in indonesia environmental laws could increase our costs 

mining operations on the scale of our indonesia operations involve significant environmental risks and challenges our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of tailings in 2021 ptfi produced approximately 52 million metric tons of tailings our tailings management plan which has been approved by the indonesia government uses the unnavigable river system in the highlands near our mine to transport the tailings to an 

engineered deposition area in the lowlands lateral levees have been constructed to help contain the footprint of the tailings and to limit their impact in the lowlands 

another major environmental challenge at ptfi is managing overburden which is rock that was required to be moved aside in the open pit mining process to reach the ore in the grasberg open pit in the presence of air water and naturally occurring bacteria some overburden can generate acid rock drainage or acidic water containing dissolved metals that if not properly managed can adversely affect the environment in addition specific overburden stockpiles are subject to erosion caused by the large amounts of rainfall with the eroded stockpile material eventually being deposited in the lowlands tailings management area the grasberg overburden stockpiles have experienced erosion over time this overburden affects the volume as well as the physical and chemical characteristics of the sediment material deposited in the lowlands tailings management area which can result in environmental impacts ptfi’s current designated tailings deposition management plan as well as robust environmental monitoring programs take into account the presence of this overburden in the lowlands tailings management area 

as part of its ongoing management and monitoring program ptfi expanded the scope of its analyses to assess possible impacts to the environment and human health from overburden erosion and tailings including conducting and updating a human health risk assessment during 2021 ptfi continued to advance work on the human health risk assessment to evaluate these potential impacts a study conducted by thirdparty expert consultants with ptfi support assessed potential exposure pathways including surface waters groundwaters sediments and soils dust and terrestrial and aquatic tissues ptfi continues further study and evaluation and in furtherance of this effort has been assisting local health authorities with a community health survey which is providing further data to evaluate any potential impacts from operations and information on community health conditions the ongoing study and evaluation which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2022 will assist in determining what additional monitoring and mitigation efforts may be required in the future 

in the past the indonesia government has raised questions with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans including a suggestion that we implement a pipeline system rather than the river transport system for tailings management our indonesia mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area such that a pipeline system would be difficult to construct and maintain and more prone to catastrophic failure and could therefore involve significant potentially adverse environmental issues based on our own studies and others conducted by third parties we do not believe that a pipeline system for all mine tailings is feasible 

overtopping or levee failure induced by extreme weather events is a potential risk additionally unanticipated structural failure of the levee system in the future could result in flooding of the nearby communities and related loss of lives andor severe personal property and environmental damages this may necessitate evacuation or relocation of communities or other emergency action financial assistance to the communities impacted and remediation costs to repair and compensate for the social cultural and economic impacts 

managing these environmental challenges at our indonesia operations could result in reputational harm and increased costs that could be significant 

in december 2018 indonesia’s ministry of environment and forestry moef issued a revised environmental permit to ptfi to address many of the operational activities that it alleged were inconsistent with earlier studies ptfi and the moef also established a new framework for continuous improvement in environmental practices at ptfi’s operations including initiatives that will examine options to potentially increase tailings retention and to evaluate large scale beneficial uses of tailings within indonesia lapiitb the thirdparty expert nominated by moef to perform the framework evaluation submitted their report to the moef in june 2021 ptfi is currently evaluating additional actions and activities based on the study conclusions in addition moef finalized environmental permitting related to the underground rail facilities and deep mill level zone dmlz production of 80 thousand metric tons per day in november 2021 permitting of certain facilities for underground mining production operations as well as permitting for the extension of levees to contain the lateral flow of tailings in the lowlands continues to progress 

we cannot assure you that future environmental changes affecting the mining industry in indonesia will not be introduced or unexpectedly altered or repealed or that new interpretations of existing indonesia environmental laws and regulations will not be issued which could have a significant impact on ptfi 

violence civil and religious strife and activism could result in loss of life and disrupt our operations 

indonesia has long faced separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces several separatist groups have sought increased political independence for the province of papua where our grasberg minerals district is located in papua there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the indonesia military and police in addition illegal miners have periodically clashed with police who have attempted for years to move them away from our facilities social economic and political instability in papua could materially and adversely affect us if it results in damage to our property or interruption of our indonesia operations 

starting in 2009 a series of shooting incidents occurred within the ptfi project area including along the road leading to our mining and milling operations since 2009 there have been 22 fatalities and more than 75 injuries to our employees contractor employees government security personnel and civilians shooting incidents in ptfi’s project area have continued on a sporadic basis through january 2021 when a helicopter contracted to ptfi was fired upon and struck by a single gunshot in an area adjacent to the project area there were several shooting incidents in the first half of 2020 including an incident near a ptfi office building where one employee was killed and two others injured in addition in december 2018 a mass shooting incident targeting a highway construction crew occurred in a remote mountain area approximately 100 miles east of the ptfi project area resulting in at least 19 fatalities and several were reported as missing separatist security incidents including shootings continue to occur regionally ptfi actively monitors security conditions and the occurrence of incidents in the region 

the safety of our workforce is a critical concern and ptfi continues to work with the indonesia government to enhance security and address security issues within the ptfi project area and in nearby areas although we have implemented measures and safeguards consistent with both international standards and our own internal standards relating to the use of force and respect for human rights the implementation of these measures and safeguards does not guarantee that personnel national police or other security forces will uphold these standards in every instance we continue to limit the use of the road leading to ptfi’s mining and milling operations to secured convoys including transport of personnel by armored vehicles in designated areas 

we cannot predict whether additional incidents will occur that could result in loss of life disruption or suspension of ptfi’s operations if other disruptive incidents occur they could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in ways that we cannot predict at this time 

south america countries have historically experienced uneven periods of economic growth as well as recession periods of high inflation and general economic and political instability since 2019 both peru and chile have experienced significant civil unrest unrelated to our operations for example in fourthquarter 2021 an unaffiliated copper producer in southern peru announced the suspension of its operations after repeated and sustained community protests on the governmentdesignated concentrate transport route along public roads which constrained the operation from shipping its product although such civil unrest has not significantly impacted our results similar events in the future could cause our south america operations to be materially impacted in which case we may not be able to meet our production and sales targets we cannot predict whether similar or more significant incidents of civil unrest will occur in the future in peru or chile 

our mining operations including future expansions or developments depend on the availability of significant quantities of secure water supplies 

we recognize that access to clean safe and reliable water supplies is vital to the health and livelihood of our host communities our mining operations require physical availability and secure legal rights to significant quantities of water and the increasing pressure on water resources requires us to consider both current and future conditions in our approach we aim to balance our operational water requirements with those of the local communities environment and ecosystems most of our north america and south america mining operations are in areas where competition for water supplies is significant and where climate change may lead to increasing scarcity of water resources in the future continuous production at our mines and any future expansions or developments are dependent on many factors including our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies current and longterm water risks include those that arise from our operations such as failure to properly manage tailings and overburden and events that we do not control such as extreme weather and other physical risks associated with climate change for further discussion of the physical impacts of climate change see the related risk factor below 

as discussed in item 3 “legal proceedings” in arizona where our operations use both surface water and groundwater we are a participant in an active adjudication in which arizona courts have been attempting for over 45 years to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for the gila river watershed one of the state’s largest river systems if we are not able to satisfactorily resolve the issues being addressed in the adjudications water uses could be diminished or curtailed and our operations at morenci safford and sierrita could be adversely affected unless we are able to acquire alternative resources 

water for our cerro verde operation in peru comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the rio chili watershed that collects water primarily from seasonal precipitation and from wastewater collected from the city of arequipa and treated at a wastewater treatment plant constructed by us as a result of occasional drought conditions temporary supply shortages that could affect our cerro verde operations are possible 

water for our el abra mining operation in chile comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascotán aquifer in 2010 el abra obtained regulatory approval for the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascotán aquifer for its sulfide processing plant which began operations in 2011 our current permit will expire in 2029 unless we are able to renew it again the agreement to pump from this aquifer is subject to continued monitoring of the aquifer water levels and select flora species to ensure that environmentally sensitive areas are not impacted by our pumping if impact occurs reductions in pumping are required to restore water levels which could have an adverse effect on production from el abra for further discussion see the risk factor above relating to the geopolitical economic and social risks associated with our international operations 

although we typically have sufficient water for our indonesia operations the area receives considerable rainfall that makes us susceptible to periodic floods and mudslides the nature and magnitude of which cannot be predicted 

although each of our mining operations currently has access to sufficient water supplies to support current operational demands as discussed above the availability of additional supplies for potential future expansions or development will require additional investments and will take time to develop if available while we are taking actions to acquire additional backup water supplies such supplies may not be available at acceptable cost or at all so that the loss of a water right or currently available water supply could force us to curtail operations or force premature closures and the ability to obtain future water supplies could prevent future expansions or developments thereby increasing andor accelerating costs or foregoing profitable operations 

fluctuations in the price and availability of commodities we purchase and constraints on supply and logistics could affect our profitability further significant delays or increases in costs affecting transportation services may affect our business 

prices and availability of commodities consumed or used in our operations such as natural gas diesel ammonium nitrate chemical reagents and steelrelated products can affect the costs of production at our operations these prices fluctuate and can be volatile and any cost increases could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in 2021 we experienced price increases on certain commodities including fuel steel ammonia and acid while these increases did not significantly impact our results in 2021 additional increases may occur in 2022 and such increases may be material 

ensuring continuity of supply of materials to our operations is critical to our business we also rely on the availability of components from suppliers for key machines and equipment which may be impacted by competition demands as well as the availability of input materials in the creation of such equipment a supplier’s failure to supply materials or components in a timely manner or to meet our quality quantity cost requirements or our technical specifications or our inability to obtain alternative sources of materials or components on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us could adversely affect our operations in 2021 we experienced longer lead times on delivery of certain materials and shortages on certain materials including lubricants semiconductors personal protective equipment rubber and acid while these delays and shortages did not significantly impact our results in 2021 these issues may continue in 2022 and such shortages and delays may be material 

our business depends on the inbound transportation of commodities we use and the outbound transportation of the commodities we produce by truck rail and ocean freight the covid19 pandemic has created global shipping and logistics challenges any significant increase in the cost of the transportation of these commodities or products as a result of increases in fuel or labor costs higher demand for logistics services or otherwise would adversely affect our results of operations additionally if the transportation service providers fail to deliver commodities used in our operations to us or the commodities we produce to our customers in a timely manner or at all such failure could 

adversely impact our ability to meet our production schedules delay our projects and capital initiatives negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

our information technology systems may be adversely affected by disruptions damage failure and risks associated with implementation and integration 

our industry has become increasingly supported by and dependent on digital technologies our strategy of operating large longlived geographically diverse assets has been increasingly dependent on our ability to become fully integrated and highly automated many of our business and operational processes are heavily dependent on traditional and emerging technology systems to conduct daytoday operations improve safety and efficiency and lower costs 

as our dependence on information systems including those of our thirdparty service providers and vendors grows we become more vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks in recent years cybersecurity events have increased in frequency and magnitude these incidents may include but are not limited to installation of malicious software phishing ransomware credential attacks unauthorized access to data and other advanced and sophisticated cybersecurity breaches and threats including threats that increasingly target critical operational technologies and process control networks if any of these threats materialize we could be subject to manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks production downtimes communication interruption or other disruptions and delays to our operations or to the transportation of products or infrastructure utilized by our operations unauthorized release of proprietary commercially sensitive confidential or otherwise protected information a misappropriation or loss of funds the corruption of data significant health and safety consequences environmental damage loss of intellectual property fines and litigation damage to our reputation or financial losses from remedial actions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition we have experienced targeted and nontargeted cybersecurity events in the past and may experience them in the future while these cybersecurity events did not result in any material loss to us or interrupt our daytoday operations as of january 31 2022 there can be no assurance that we will not experience any such losses or interruption in the future given the unpredictability of the timing and the evolving nature and scope of information technology disruptions the various procedures and controls we use to monitor and protect against these threats and to mitigate our potential risks to such threats may not be sufficient in preventing cybersecurity events from materializing further as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities to cybersecurity threats 

we could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective not installed properly or not properly integrated into our operations system modification failures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations and could if not successfully implemented adversely impact the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 

human capital risks 

labor disputes or labor unrest could disrupt our operations 

our business is dependent on maintaining good relations with our workforce a significant portion of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates refer to items 1 and 2 “business and properties” of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding labor matters and expiration dates of such agreements as of december 31 2021 approximately 31 percent of our global labor force was covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 14 percent of our global labor force was covered by agreements that will or were scheduled to expire during 2022 

labor agreements are negotiated on a periodic basis and may not be renewed on reasonably satisfactory terms to us or at all if we do not successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements with our union workers we may incur prolonged strikes and other work stoppages at our mining operations which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations additionally if we enter into a new labor agreement with any union that significantly increases our labor costs relative to our competitors our ability to compete may be materially and adversely affected 

we could experience labor disruptions such as work stoppages work slowdowns union organizing campaigns strikes or lockouts that could adversely affect our operations for example during thirdquarter 2016 ptfi experienced labor productivity issues and a 10day work stoppage which continued during fourthquarter 2016 and into the first half of 2017 beginning in midapril 2017 ptfi experienced a high level of worker absenteeism which unfavorably impacted mining and milling rates and in may 2017 a significant number of employees and contractors elected to participate in an illegal strike action these employees were subsequently deemed to have voluntarily resigned under existing indonesia laws and regulations resulting in increased costs associated with employee severance in thirdquarter 2020 we experienced a fiveday laborrelated work stoppage related to covid19 travel restrictions when a small group of workers at ptfi staged protests and a blockade restricting access to the main road to the mining operations area we reached an amicable resolution with the group of workers while upholding our covid19 safety protocols there were no strikes or lockouts at any of our operations in 2021 

we cannot predict whether additional labor disruptions will occur significant reductions in productivity or protracted work stoppages at one or more of our operations could significantly reduce our production and sales volumes or disrupt operations which could adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

our future success depends on our ability to attract retain and develop qualified personnel 

our success is dependent on the contributions of our highly skilled and experienced workforce our business depends upon our ability to attract retain and develop a qualified inclusive and diverse workforce our ability to attract qualified personnel is affected by the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the available positions the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages if we fail to attract retain and develop qualified inclusive and diverse personnel necessary for the efficient operation of our business this could result in decreased profitability productivity and efficiency which may have a material adverse effect on our performance 

risks related to development projects and mineral reserves 

development projects are inherently risky and may require more capital and have lower economic returns than anticipated and the development of our underground mines are also subject to other unique risks 

mine development projects typically require a number of years and significant expenditures during the development phase before production is possible our development projects include underground development activities at the grasberg block cave dmlz and kucing liar ore bodies in the grasberg minerals district which currently constitute approximately 28 percent of our estimated consolidated recoverable proven and probable copper reserves and 94 percent of our estimated consolidated recoverable proven and probable gold reserves there are many risks and uncertainties inherent in all development projects including but not limited to unexpected or difficult geological formations or conditions potential delays cost overruns lower levels of production during rampup periods shortages of material or labor construction defects breakdowns and injuries to persons and property 

the development of our underground mines are also subject to other unique risks including but not limited to underground fires or floods ventilating harmful gases fallofground accidents and seismic activity resulting from unexpected or difficult geological formations or conditions for example we experience mining induced seismic activity from time to time in the grasberg minerals district while we anticipate taking all measures that we deem reasonable and prudent in connection with the development of our underground mines to safely manage production there is no assurance that these risks will not cause schedule delays revised mine plans injuries to persons and property or increased capital costs any of which may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition additionally although we devote significant time and resources to our project planning approval and review processes many of our development projects are highly complex and rely on factors that are outside of our control which may cause the actual time and capital required to complete a development project to exceed our estimates 

exploration is highly speculative and our exploration activities may not result in additional discoveries to replace mineral reserves 

our existing mineral reserves will be depleted over time by production from our operations because our profits are primarily derived from our mining operations our ability to replenish our mineral reserves is essential to our longterm success depleted mineral reserves can be replaced in several ways including expanding known ore bodies reducing operating costs that could extend the life of a mine by allowing us to costeffectively process ore types that were previously considered uneconomic by locating new deposits or acquiring interests in mineral reserves from third parties exploration is highly speculative in nature involves many risks and uncertainties requires substantial capital expenditures and in some instances advances in processing technology and is frequently unsuccessful in discovering significant mineral resources since new large longlife deposits are increasingly scarce accordingly our current or future exploration programs may not result in the discovery of additional deposits that can be produced profitably even if significant mineral resources are discovered it will likely take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production during which time the economic feasibility of production may change we may not be able to discover enhance develop or acquire mineral reserves in sufficient quantities to maintain or grow our current reserve levels which could negatively affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources are uncertain and the volume and grade of ore actually recovered may vary from our estimates 

our estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources have been prepared in accordance with the disclosure requirements of subpart 1300 of us securities and exchange commission sec regulation sk there are numerous uncertainties inherent in mineral estimates such estimates are to a large extent based on assumed longterm prices for the commodities we produce primarily copper gold and molybdenum and interpretations of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other exploration techniques which may not necessarily be indicative of future results our mineral estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies we conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk we revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies geological assumptions about our mineral resources that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available 

estimates of mineral reserves or the cost at which we anticipate the mineral reserves will be recovered are based on assumptions such as metal prices and other economic inputs changes to such assumptions may require revisions to reserve estimates which could affect our asset carrying values and may also negatively impact our future financial condition and results until mineral reserves are actually mined and processed the quantity of ore and grades must be considered as an estimate only 

in addition if the market prices for the commodities we produce decline from assumed levels if production costs increase or recovery rates decrease or if applicable laws and regulations are adversely changed we can offer no assurance that the indicated level of recovery will be realized or that mineral reserves can be mined or processed profitably if we determine that certain of our estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves have become uneconomic this may ultimately lead to a reduction in our aggregate reported mineral reserves which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

additionally the term “mineral resources” does not indicate recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as defined by the sec estimates of mineral resources are subject to further exploration and evaluation of development and operating costs grades recoveries and other material factors and therefore are subject to considerable uncertainty mineral resources do not meet the threshold for mineral reserve modifying factors such as engineering legal andor economic feasibility that would allow for the conversion to mineral reserves accordingly no assurance can be given that the estimated mineral resources not included in mineral reserves will become recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves 

regulatory environmental and social risks 

the costs of compliance with environmental health and safety laws and regulations applicable to our operations may constrain existing operations or expansion opportunities related permit and other approval requirements may delay or result in a suspension of our operations 

our operations are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations including environmental laws and regulations governing the generation storage treatment transportation and disposal of hazardous substances solid waste disposal air emissions wastewater discharges remediation restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination including mine closures and reclamation protection of endangered and threatened species and designation of critical habitats and other related matters these laws and regulations are subject to change and to changing interpretation by governmental agencies and other bodies vested with broad supervisory authority as a mining company compliance with environmental health and safety laws and regulations is an integral and costly part of our business in addition we must obtain regulatory permits and approvals to start continue and expand operations 

certain federal and similar state laws and regulations may expose us to joint and several liability for environmental damages caused by our operations or by previous owners or operators of properties we acquired or are currently operating or at sites where we previously sent materials for processing recycling or disposal as discussed in more detail in the risk factor below relating to costs incurred for remediating environmental conditions on our properties that are no longer in operation we have substantial obligations for environmental remediation on properties previously owned or operated by freeport minerals corporation fmc and certain of its affiliates noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in material penalties or other liabilities in addition compliance with these laws may from time to time result in delays in or changes to our development or expansion plans compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs which we expect will continue to increase over time because of increased regulatory oversight adoption of increasingly stringent environmental standards and other factors 

new or revised environmental regulatory requirements are frequently proposed many of which result in substantially increased costs for our business including those regarding financial obligations regulations have been considered at various governmental levels to increase financial responsibility requirements for mine closure and reclamation adoption of such environmental regulations or more stringent application of existing regulations may materially increase our costs threaten certain operating activities and constrain our expansion opportunities in addition no assurances can be made that restrictions relating to conservation will not have an adverse impact on expansion of our operations or not result in delays in project development constraints on exploration and constraints on operations in impacted areas 

we have incurred and expect to incur environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs including our joint venture partners’ shares to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect our operations the timing and amounts of estimated payments could change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements changes in scope and costs of reclamation activities the settlement of environmental matters and the rate at which actual spending occurs on continuing matters 

we are also subject to extensive regulation of worker health and safety our mines are inspected on a regular basis by government regulators who may issue citations and orders when they believe a violation has occurred under applicable mining regulations if inspections result in an alleged violation we may be subject to fines and penalties and in instances of alleged significant violations our mining operations or industrial facilities could be subject to temporary or extended closures 

many other governmental bodies regulate other aspects of our operations and our failure to comply with these legal requirements can result in substantial penalties in addition new laws and regulations including executive orders or changes to or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations by courts or regulatory authorities occur regularly but are difficult to predict any such variations could negatively impact the mining sector including our business substantially increase costs to achieve compliance or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

for additional information regarding the various regulations affecting us see items 1 and 2 “business and properties” of this annual report on form 10k 

we incur significant costs for remediating environmental conditions on properties that have not been operated in many years 

fmc and its subsidiaries and many of their affiliates and predecessor companies have been involved in exploration mining milling smelting and manufacturing in the us for more than a century activities that occurred in the late 19th century and the 20th century prior to the advent of modern environmental laws were not subject to environmental regulation and were conducted before american industrial companies fully understood the longterm effects of their operations on the surrounding environment 

companies like fmc are now legally responsible for remediating hazardous substances released into the environment from properties owned or operated by them as well as properties where they arranged for disposal of such substances irrespective of when the release to the environment occurred or who caused it that liability is often asserted on a joint and several basis with other prior and subsequent owners operators and arrangers meaning that each owner or operator of the property is and each arranger may be held fully responsible for the remediation although in many cases some or all of the other responsible parties no longer exist do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found as a result because of our acquisition of fmc in 2007 many of the subsidiary companies we now own are potentially responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the us and we expect to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those remediation issues we are also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources 

at december 31 2021 we had more than 100 active remediation projects in 24 us states in addition fmc and certain affiliates and predecessor companies were parties to agreements relating to the transfer of businesses or properties that contained indemnification provisions relating to environmental matters and from time to time these provisions become the source of claims against us 

our environmental obligation estimates are primarily based upon 

• our knowledge and beliefs about complex scientific and historical facts and circumstances that in many cases occurred many decades ago 

• our beliefs and assumptions regarding the nature extent and duration of remediation activities that we will be required to undertake and the estimated costs of those remediation activities which are subject to varying interpretations and 

• our beliefs regarding the requirements that are imposed on us by existing laws and regulations and in some cases the clarification of uncertain regulatory requirements that could materially affect our environmental obligation estimates 

significant adjustments to these estimates are likely to occur in the future as additional information becomes available the actual environmental costs may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs and any such changes could be material 

in addition remediation standards imposed by the us environmental protection agency and state environmental agencies have generally become more stringent over time and may become even more stringent in the future imposition of more stringent remediation standards particularly for arsenic and lead in soils poses a risk that additional remediation work could be required at our active remediation sites and at sites that we have already remediated to the satisfaction of the responsible governmental agencies and may increase the risk of toxic tort litigation 

refer to items 1 and 2 “business and properties” and note 12 for further discussion of our environmental obligations 

we face increasing regulatory and stakeholder expectations relating to our ghg emissions and energy transition plans which may adversely affect our business further we may not be able to timely or successfully transition from fossil fuel sources for our significant energy needs which may result in reputational damage 

our operations require significant energy much of which is currently from fossil fuel sources and is obtained from third parties under longterm contracts energy represented approximately 21 percent of our copper mine site operating costs in 2021 and is expected to approximate 25 percent in 2022 the principal sources of energy consumption at our mining operations are diesel fuel which powers mine trucks and other transportation equipment purchased electricity which powers core facilities and certain onsite metal processing operations and coal and natural gas which provides electricity at certain operations 

existing and proposed new governmental conventions laws regulations and standards both in the us and internationally including those related to climate and ghg emissions may in the future add significantly to our operating costs limit or modify our operations and require more resources to comply and remediate in response for additional information on climate change conventions laws regulations and standards applicable to fcx refer to items 1 and 2 “business and properties” 

if we do not adapt to the expectations of stakeholders regarding a lowcarbon future in a timely manner it may result in reputational damage with key stakeholders impacting investor confidence market value and access to and cost of capital in response to climate change and societal demands for action we have announced ghg emissions reduction targets and aspirations which will result in additional costs to us and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to achieve any current or future ghg emissions targets or aspirations 

while we strive to transition to more renewable power sources for our mining operations as a commercial consumer of power our ability to reduce our ghg emissions associated with our power consumption demand is dependent upon the mix of our suppliers and locallyavailable renewable energy resources at our various sites the transition to renewable and other energy sources could among other things increase our capital expenditures operating and energy costs depending on the scope magnitude and timing of increased regulation of fossilfuel based energy production including ghg emissions as well as the availability of alternative energy sources 

in certain aspects of our operations our ability to reduce our ghg emissions is directly dependent on the actions of third parties and technological solutions and innovation and our ability to make significant rapid changes in our ghg emissions in response to potential future regulations may be limited for example our dieselfueled mine trucks are a significant contributor to ghg emissions at our north america and south america operations but reduction of emissions from mine trucks will depend upon the development of alternativefueled mining equipment by our thirdparty suppliers at our remote operations in indonesia we own and operate a coalfired power plant and our ability to transition to commercially viable alternative sources of energy will depend on among other things a feasibility study and technological considerations 

the physical impacts of climate change may adversely affect our mining operations workforce and supply chain 

we recognize that as the climate changes our operations workforce and supply chain may be exposed to changes in the frequency intensity andor duration of intense storms drought flooding including from sea level rise at our coastal operations wildfire and other extreme weather events and patterns such potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would vary by operation based on particular geographic circumstances at many of our mine sites climate change is projected to impact local precipitation regimes resulting in shorterduration higherintensity storm events and the potential for less precipitation overall we could face increased operational costs associated with managing additional volumes of storm water during more intense future events including supply disruption delays and increased pricing in addition the potential for overall decreases in precipitation could affect the availability of water needed for our operations leading to increased operating costs or in extreme cases disruptions to mining operations 

in addition with respect to our tailings facilities as part of our commitment to implementing the tailings standard discussed in items 1 and 2 “business and properties” herein we will be required to consider uncertainties due to climate change incorporate that assessment into the relevant knowledge base for our tailings facilities use this knowledge base to enhance the resilience of our approach to the impacts of climate change using an adaptive management approach incorporate that knowledge into facility operations and take measures to mitigate both 

environmental impact and potential failure risks at our tailings facilities including those arising from climate change these obligations likely will require future changes at our tailings facilities which could increase our operational expenses or require further capital investments 

increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from stakeholders with respect to our esg practices performance commitments and disclosures may impact our reputation increase our costs and impact our access to capital 

stakeholder scrutiny related to our esg practices commitments performance and disclosures continues to increase we have adopted certain policies and programs including with respect to responsible production frameworks climate change water stewardship biodiversity tailings management and stewardship waste management safety and health human capital management human rights social performance and community and indigenous peoples relations and supply chainresponsible sourcing it is possible however that our stakeholders might not be satisfied with our esg practices commitments performance andor disclosures or the speed of their adoption implementation and measurable success if we do not meet our stakeholders’ evolving expectations our reputation access to and cost of capital and stock price could be negatively impacted 

investor advocacy groups certain institutional investors investment funds creditors and other influential investors are increasingly focused on our esg practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the esg implications of their investments and lending decisions 

organizations that provide information to investors and financial institutions on esg performance and related matters have developed quantitative and qualitative data collection processes and ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to esg matters such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions in addition many investors have created their own proprietary ratings that inform their investment and voting decisions unfavorable ratings or assessment of our esg practices including our compliance with certain disclosure standards and frameworks may lead to negative investor sentiment toward us which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and cost of capital 

similarly some financial institutions have incorporated esg ratings into their credit risk assessments and screen companies based on their esg practices and performance when making lending decisions if we are unable to meet the esg lending criteria set by our creditors or are required to take certain remediation steps to satisfy such criteria our access to capital on terms we find favorable may be limited and our costs may increase 

as we continue to focus on our esg practices commitments performance and disclosures and as esgrelated regulations and disclosure standards and frameworks continue to evolve we have expanded our public disclosures in these areas such disclosures may reflect goals aspirations commitments cost estimates and other expectations and assumptions including over long timeframes which are necessarily uncertain and may not be realized 

further the voluntary disclosure standards or frameworks we choose to align with are evolving and may change over time and our interpretation of such disclosure standards and frameworks may differ from those of others either of which may result in a lack of consistent or meaningful comparative data from period to period andor significant revisions to our goals and aspirations or reported progress in achieving such goals and aspirations 

ensuring that there are adequate systems and processes in place to comply with the various esg tracking and disclosure obligations will require management’s time and expense if we do not adapt to or comply with investor or stakeholder expectations including with respect to evolving disclosure standards and frameworks or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so we may suffer from reputational damage and our business financial condition cost of capital andor stock price could be materially and adversely affected 

in addition our customers and end users may require that we implement certain additional esg procedures or standards before they will start or continue to do business with us which could lead to preferential buying based on our esg practices compared to our competitors’ esg practices further being associated with activities by suppliers contractors or other affiliates that have or are perceived to have individual or cumulative adverse impacts on the environment climate biodiversity and land management water access and management human rights or cultural heritage could negatively affect our reputation and impose additional costs 

failure or the perceived failure to manage our relationships with the communities andor indigenous peoples where we operate or that are near our operations could harm our reputation and social license to operate 

our relationships with the communities andor indigenous peoples where we operate or that are adjacent to or near our operations are critical to the longterm success of our existing operations and the development of any future projects there is ongoing and increasing stakeholder concern relating to a company’s social license to operate and the perceived effects of mining activities on the environment and on communities impacted by such activities we may engage in activities such as exploration production construction or expansion of our operations that have or are perceived to have adverse impacts on the local communities and their relevant stakeholders society as a whole indigenous peoples cultural heritage human rights and the environment among other things for example our operations may take place on or adjacent to indigenous peoples’ ancestral lands and such indigenous peoples may assert rights to the lands where we operate further we may be required or expected by our stakeholders to consult with andor obtain consent from indigenous peoples with respect to these operations 

in addition our assets are generally longlived and stakeholders’ perceptions and expectations can change over the life of the mine changes in the aspirations and expectations of local communities andor indigenous peoples where we operate with respect to our employee health and safety performance and our contributions to infrastructure community development environmental management and other factors could affect our social license to operate and reputation and could lead to delays andor increased costs if expansions or new projects are blocked either temporarily or for extended periods failure to effectively engage with communities on an ongoing basis including the withdrawal of consent or support of indigenous peoples or other stakeholders could adversely impact our business damage our reputation andor result in loss of rights to explore operate or develop our projects 

risks related to our common stock 

our holding company structure may impact our ability to service our debt declare dividends and repurchase shares 

we are a holding company with no material assets other than the capital stock and intercompany receivables of our subsidiaries as a result our ability to repay our indebtedness and pay dividends is dependent on the generation of cash flows by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend loan debt repayment or otherwise our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to make funds available to us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends dividends from subsidiaries that are not wholly owned are shared with other equity owners cash at our international operations is also typically subject to foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation into the us 

in addition our subsidiaries may not be able to or be permitted to make distributions to us or repay loans to us to enable us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal restrictions as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries certain of our subsidiaries are parties to credit agreements that restrict their ability to make distributions or loan repayments to us if such subsidiary is in default under such agreements or to transfer substantially all of the assets of such subsidiary without the consent of the lenders our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries’ assets upon their liquidation reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries’ creditors including any trade creditors 

as more fully described in note 10 during 2021 our board of directors board adopted a performancebased payout framework which currently includes base and variable dividends and a share repurchase program our ability to continue to pay dividends base or variable and the timing and amount of any share repurchases is at the discretion of our board and management respectively and is subject to a number of factors including maintaining our net debt target capital availability our financial results cash requirements business prospects global economic conditions changes in laws contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board or management as applicable our share repurchase program may be modified increased suspended or terminated at any time at the board’s discretion our dividend payments and share repurchases may change and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares at all or in any particular amounts a reduction or suspension in our dividend payments or share repurchases could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult these provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by the board refer to exhibit 41 for further discussion of our antitakeover provisions 

further our bylaws provide to the fullest extent permitted by law that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware or if the court of chancery does not have or declines to accept jurisdiction the united states district court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any i derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf ii action asserting a claim that is based upon a violation of a duty by any of our current or former directors officers employees or stockholders in such capacity iii action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law or to which the delaware general corporation law confers jurisdiction upon the court of chancery of the state of delaware iv action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine or v action asserting an “internal corporate claim” as that term is defined in section 115 of the delaware general corporation law the choice of forum provision may increase costs to bring a claim discourage claims or limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees which may discourage such lawsuits against us or our directors officers and other employees alternatively if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions the exclusive forum provision in our bylaws will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under the federal securities laws including the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the securities act of 1933 as amended or the respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder 

in addition because we are incorporated in delaware we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with or acquisition of us 

these provisions may deter an acquisition of us that might otherwise be attractive to our stockholders 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

not applicable 







 item 3 legal proceedings 

below is a discussion of our material pending legal proceedings not otherwise required to be disclosed in our notes to consolidated financial statements refer to note 12 for a discussion of other material pending legal proceedings 

in addition to the material pending legal proceedings discussed below and in note 12 we are involved periodically in ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business and not required to be disclosed some of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief 

united states us securities and exchange commission sec regulations require us to disclose environmental proceedings involving a governmental authority if we reasonably believe that such proceedings may result in monetary sanctions above a stated threshold pursuant to the sec regulations we use a threshold of 1 million for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such environmental proceedings is required 

management does not believe based on currently available information that the outcome of any currently pending legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition although individual or cumulative outcomes could be material to our operating results for a particular period depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period 

water rights adjudications 

our operations in the western us require significant secure quantities of water for mining and ore processing activities and related support facilities continuous operation of our mines is dependent on among other things our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies in the arid western us where certain of our mines are located water rights are often contested and disputes over water rights are generally timeconsuming expensive and not necessarily dispositive unless they resolve both actual and potential claims the loss of a water right or a currently available water supply could force us to curtail operations or force premature closures thereby increasing andor accelerating costs or foregoing profitable operations 

at our north america operations certain of our water supplies are supported by surface water rights which give us the right to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location in arizona where our operations use both surface and groundwater we are a participant in an active adjudication in which arizona courts have been attempting for over 45 years to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for the gila river system one of the state’s largest river systems this gila river adjudication primarily affects our morenci safford including lone star and sierrita mines the gila river adjudication is addressing the state law claims of thousands of competing users including us as well as significant federal water claims that are potentially adverse to the state law claims of both surface water and groundwater users groundwater is treated differently from surface water under arizona law which historically allowed land owners to pump unlimited quantities of subsurface water subject only to the requirement of putting it to “reasonable use” however court decisions in the adjudication have concluded that some subsurface water constitutes “subflow” that is to be treated legally as surface water and is therefore subject to the arizona doctrine of prior appropriation and to the adjudication and potentially unavailable to groundwater pumpers including us in the absence of valid surface water claims any recharacterization of groundwater as surface water could affect the ability of consumers farmers ranchers municipalities and industrial users like us to continue to access water supplies that have been relied on for decades because we are a user of both groundwater and surface water in arizona we are an active participant in the gila river adjudication 

in re the general adjudication of all rights to use water in the gila river system and sources  maricopa county superior court cause nos w1 salt w2 verde w3 upper gila and w4 san pedro this case was originally initiated in 1974 with the filing of a petition with the arizona state land department and was consolidated and transferred to the maricopa county superior court in 1981 the principal parties in addition to us include arizona public service company asarco llc bhp copper inc the state of arizona various cities and towns and water companies the gila valley irrigation district the franklin irrigation district the san carlos irrigation and drainage district the salt river project the san carlos apache tribe the gila river indian community and the us on behalf of those tribes on its own behalf and on behalf of the white mountain apache tribe the fort mcdowell mohaveapache indian community the salt river pimamaricopa indian community and the payson community of yavapai apache indians prior to january 1 1983 various indian tribes filed separate suits in the us district court in arizona claiming superior rights to water being used by many other parties including us and claiming damages for prior use in derogation of their allegedly superior rights these federal proceedings have been stayed in favor of the adjudications pending in arizona state courts and some of the federal suits have since been settled 

in 2005 the maricopa county superior court directed the arizona department of water resources adwr to prepare detailed recommendations regarding the delineation of the “subflow” zone of the san pedro river a tributary of the gila river subsurface water within the subflow zone is presumed to constitute appropriable subflow rather than groundwater although we have minimal interests in the san pedro river basin a decision that recharacterizes groundwater in that basin as appropriable subflow may set a precedent for other river systems in arizona that could have material implications for many commercial industrial municipal and agricultural users of groundwater including our arizona operations in 2017 the court approved adwr’s proposed subflow zone maps water pumped from wells located inside the mapped subflow zone is now presumed to be appropriable subflow no party has appealed that decision 

adwr is now in the process of preparing subflow delineations for the applicable watercourses in verde river watershed in december 2021 adwr issued a report proposing a delineation for the verde river mainstem and sycamore creek and objections to that report are due in may 2022 we do not have any active mining operations in the verde watershed that would be impacted by this phase of the adjudication 

in 2014 adwr submitted a proposal for the development of procedures for “cone of depression” analyses to determine whether a well located outside of the subflow zone creates a cone of depression that intersects the subflow zone based on these cone of depression analyses wells outside of the subflow zone could be subject to the adjudications pending in arizona state courts in the absence of a valid surface water claim to support the pumping owners of wells deemed to be depleting the subflow zone through their cones of depression may be subject to claims that they must refrain from pumping subflow or must pay damages in january 2017 adwr issued a report containing its recommended cone of depression test and a trial was held in march 2018 concerning adwr’s recommended action 

on november 14 2018 the special master for the gila river adjudication issued a final decision rejecting adwr’s recommended cone of depression test instead adopting our position that a numeric model capable of accounting for complexities of the aquifer system should be used the special master also confirmed that the cone of depression test instead would be an initial test for determining which wells are subject to the adjudications rather than proving that a well is pumping subflow or establishing how much of a well’s water production is subflow such matters will be determined by a subsequent “subflow depletion test” which has not yet been formulated some of our adversaries objected to the special master’s final decision and the arizona superior court heard oral argument on the objections in february 2020 this issue remains under advisement with the arizona superior court 

in response to the special master’s decision in december 2018 adwr submitted its initial report on the “subflow depletion test” which will specify the methodology a well owner must use to quantify the portion of the water drawn from a well that is subflow as opposed to groundwater however adwr remains in the process of developing its proposed subflow depletion test we along with the other parties will have the opportunity to provide input throughout the process 

the first issue litigated concerned whether for the subflow depletion test the subflow zone should be represented in the numeric model as extending only as deep as the bottom of the floodplain alluvium or extend all the way down to bedrock in august 2021 the special master issued an order recognizing our position that if the vertical extent of the subflow zone is extended below the floodplain alluvium it would result in overstated depletion calculations accordingly the special master ordered that the vertical boundary of the subflow zone be restricted to the floodplain alluvium to date our adversaries have not taken steps to appeal this ruling 

in proceedings separate from the development of the depletion test in june 2020 the special master designated legal questions to be resolved concerning a well owner’s ability to obtain a surface water right for subsurface water that while initially believed to be nonappropriable groundwater is ultimately determined to be appropriable subflow in april 2021 the special master ruled that for uses initiated after enactment of the 1919 permitting statute a well owner may not pursue a surface water right unless the well owner filed an application for a permit to appropriate 

as part of the adjudications the us has asserted numerous claims for express and implied “reserved” surface water and groundwater rights on indian and nonindian federal lands throughout arizona these claims are related to reservations of federal land for specific purposes eg indian reservations national parks military bases and wilderness areas unlike state lawbased water rights federal reserved water rights are given priority in the “prior appropriation” system based on the date the land was reserved not the date that water was first used on the land in addition federal reserved water rights may enjoy greater protection from groundwater pumping than is accorded to state lawbased water rights 

in multiple instances the us asserts a right to all water in a particular watershed that was not effectively appropriated under state law prior to the establishment of the federal reservation this creates risks for both surface water users and groundwater users because such expansive claims may severely impede competing uses of water within the same watershed because there are numerous federal reservations in watersheds across arizona the reserved water right claims of the us pose a significant risk to multiple operations including morenci and safford including lone star in the upper gila river watershed and sierrita in the santa cruz watershed because federal reserved water rights may adversely affect water uses at each of these operations we have been actively involved in litigation over these claims because federal reserved water rights have not yet been quantified the task of determining how much water each federal reservation may use has been left to the arizona superior court handling the gila river adjudication several “contested cases” to quantify reserved water rights for particular federal reservations in arizona are currently pending with only one resolved at this time that case in re aravaipa canyon wilderness area was to resolve the us’s claims to water for the aravaipa canyon wilderness area the case was tried in 2015 and the court issued a decision in december 2018 supportive of our position on almost all issues including rejection of us’s core argument that wilderness areas are entitled to all water that was not appropriated 

at the time the reservation was created we believe the rulings in this case will support our positions in other pending federal reserved water right cases including these in re fort huachuca  which involves the us’s claims to water for an arizona army base and is awaiting a decision following a trial which concluded in february 2017 in re redfield canyon wilderness area  which involves the us’s claims to water for another wilderness area and is awaiting a decision following a trial which concluded in may 2017 and in re san pedro riparian national conservation area  which involves the us’s claims to water for a national conservation area and is awaiting a decision following a trial which concluded in may 2018 

given the legal and technical complexity of these adjudications their long history and their longterm legal economic and political implications it is difficult to predict the timing or the outcome of these proceedings if we are not able to satisfactorily resolve the issues being addressed in the adjudications our ability to pump groundwater could be diminished or curtailed and our operations at morenci safford including lone star and sierrita could be adversely affected unless we are able to acquire alternative water resources

copper gold and molybdenum 

following is a brief discussion of our primary natural resources – copper gold and molybdenum for further discussion of historical and current market prices of these commodities refer to mda and item 1a “risk factors” 

copper 

copper is an internationally traded commodity and its prices are determined by the major metals exchanges – the london metal exchange lme commodity exchange inc comex and shanghai futures exchange prices on these exchanges generally reflect the worldwide balance of copper supply and demand and can be volatile and cyclical during 2020 the lme copper settlement price averaged 280 per pound ranging from a low of 209 per pound to a high of 361 per pound and was 351 per pound at december 31 2020 

in general demand for copper reflects the rate of underlying world economic growth particularly in industrial production and construction according to wood mackenzie a widely followed independent metals market consultant copper’s enduse markets and their estimated shares of total consumption are construction 28 percent electrical applications 28 percent consumer products 21 percent transportation 12 percent and industrial machinery 11 percent we believe copper will continue to be essential in these basic uses as well as contribute significantly to new technologies for clean energy to advance communications and to enhance public health examples of areas we believe will require additional copper in the future include i high efficiency motors which consume up to 75 percent more copper than a standard motor ii electric vehicles which consume up to four times the amount of copper in terms of weight compared to vehicles of similar size with an internal combustion engine and require copperintensive charging station infrastructure to refuel and iii renewable energy such as wind and solar which consume four to five times the amount of copper compared to traditional fossil fuel generated power 

gold 

gold is used for jewelry coinage and bullion as well as various industrial and electronic applications gold can be readily sold on numerous markets throughout the world benchmark prices are generally based on london bullion market association london quotations during 2020 the london pm gold price averaged 1770 per ounce ranging from a low of 1474 per ounce to a record high of 2067 per ounce and was 1888 per ounce on december 30 2020 there was no london pm gold price quote on december 31 2020 

molybdenum 

molybdenum is a key alloying element in steel and the raw material for several chemicalgrade products used in catalysts lubrication smoke suppression corrosion inhibition and pigmentation molybdenum as a highpurity metal is also used in electronics such as flatpanel displays and in super alloys used in aerospace reference prices for molybdenum are available in several publications including metals week cru report and metal bulletin  during 2020 the weekly average price of molybdenum quoted by metals week averaged 869 per pound ranging from a low of 701 per pound to a high of 1079 per pound and was 986 per pound at december 31 2020

climax operations receive electrical power through longterm contracts with xcel energy and natural gas through longterm contracts with encore energy we believe the climax operation has sufficient water resources to support current operations 

south america 

at our operations in south america mine properties and facilities are controlled through mining claims or concessions under the general mining laws of the relevant country the claims or concessions are owned or controlled by the operating companies in which we or our subsidiaries have a controlling ownership interest roads power lines and aqueducts are controlled by easements 

cerro verde 

we have a 5356 percent ownership interest in cerro verde with the remaining 4644 percent held by smm cerro verde netherlands bv 210 percent compañia de minas buenaventura saa 1958 percent and other stockholders whose shares are publicly traded on the lima stock exchange 586 percent 

cerro verde is an openpit copper and molybdenum mining complex that has been in operation since 1976 and is located 20 miles southwest of arequipa peru the site is accessible by paved highway cerro verde’s copper cathode and concentrate production that is not sold locally is transported approximately 70 miles by truck and by rail to the port of matarani for shipment to international markets 

the cerro verde mine is a porphyry copper deposit that has oxide secondary sulfide and primary sulfide mineralization the predominant oxide copper minerals are brochantite chrysocolla malachite and copper “pitch” chalcocite and covellite are the most important secondary copper sulfide minerals chalcopyrite and molybdenite are the dominant primary sulfides 

cerro verde’s operation consists of an openpit copper mine two concentrating facilities capable of milling a total of 409500 metric tons of ore per day and sxew leaching facilities leach copper production is derived from a 39000 metric tonperday crushed leach facility and a 100000 metric tonperday rom leach system this sxew leaching operation has a capacity of approximately 200 million pounds of copper per year 

the available fleet consists of fifty 290metric ton haul trucks and ninetythree 230metric ton haul trucks 21 of which are currently on standby loaded by thirteen electric shovels with bucket sizes ranging in size from 33 to 57 cubic meters and two hydraulic shovels with a bucket size of 21 cubic meters both of which are currently on standby this fleet is capable of moving an average of approximately 910000 metric tons of material per day 

in midmarch 2020 the peru government issued a supreme decree and declaration of a national emergency in its efforts to contain the outbreak of covid19 to comply with the government requirements we temporarily transitioned our cerro verde mine to care and maintenance status and adjusted operations to prioritize critical activities a plan for cerro verde to restore operations was approved by the peru government in secondquarter 2020 and strict health protocols have been implemented this plan has allowed cerro verde to run both concentrators at their aggregate average design capacity of 360000 metric tonperday in the second half of 2020 

cerro verde’s production totaled 08 billion pounds of copper and 19 million pounds of molybdenum in 2020 10 billion pounds of copper and 29 million pounds of molybdenum in 2019 and 10 billion pounds of copper and 28 million pounds of molybdenum in 2018 

cerro verde is located in a desert environment with rainfall averaging 15 inches per year and is in an active seismic zone the highest bench elevation is 2750 meters above sea level and the ultimate pit bottom is expected to be 1553 meters above sea level the peru general mining law and cerro verde’s mining stability agreement grant the surface rights of mining concessions located on government land government land obtained after 1997 must be leased or purchased cerro verde has a mining concession covering approximately 180000 acres including access to 14600 acres granted through an easement from the peru national assets office plus 150 acres of owned property and 1151 acres of rightsofway outside the mining concession area 

cerro verde receives electrical power including hydrogenerated power under longterm contracts with kallpa generación sa electroperu and engie energia peru sa 

water for our cerro verde processing operations comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the rio chili watershed that collect water primarily from seasonal precipitation and from wastewater collected from the city of arequipa and treated at a wastewater treatment plant we believe the cerro verde operation has sufficient water resources to support current operations for further discussion of risks associated with the availability of water see item 1a “risk factors” 

el abra 

we own a 51 percent interest in el abra and the remaining 49 percent interest is held by the stateowned copper enterprise corporación nacional del cobre de chile 

el abra is an openpit copper mining complex that has been in operation since 1996 and is located 47 miles north of calama in chile’s el loa province region ii the site is accessible by paved highway and by rail 

the el abra mine is a porphyry copper deposit that has sulfide and oxide mineralization the predominant primary sulfide copper minerals are bornite and chalcopyrite there is a minor amount of secondary sulfide mineralization as chalcocite the oxide copper minerals are chrysocolla and pseudomalachite there are lesser amounts of copper bearing clays and tenorite 

the el abra operation consists of an openpit copper mine and a sxew facility with a capacity of 500 million pounds of copper cathode per year from a 125000 metric tonperday crushed leach circuit and a rom leaching operation the available fleet consists of twentythree 242metric ton haul trucks loaded by four shovels with buckets ranging in size from 29 to 41 cubic meters which are capable of moving an average of 224000 metric tons of material per day 

in april 2020 we revised our operating plans at el abra to incorporate lower mining rates operating costs and capital spending we deferred the construction of a new leach pad at el abra from 2020 to future periods we plan to increase operating rates during 2021 to precovid19 levels subject to ongoing monitoring of public health conditions in chile incremental copper production associated with increasing el abras stacking rates from 65000 metric tons of ore per day to over 100000 metric tons of ore per day approximates 70 million pounds per year beginning in 2022 

el abra’s copper production totaled 159 million pounds in 2020 180 million pounds in 2019 and 200 million pounds in 2018 

we continue to evaluate a largescale expansion at el abra to process additional sulfide material and to achieve higher recoveries el abra’s large sulfide resource could potentially support a major mill project similar to facilities constructed at cerro verde technical and economic studies continue to be evaluated to determine the optimal scope and timing for the project in parallel with extending the life of the current leaching operation 

el abra is located in a desert environment with rainfall averaging less than one inch per year and is in an active seismic zone the highest bench elevation is 4195 meters above sea level and the ultimate pit bottom is expected to be 3385 meters above sea level el abra controls a total of approximately 182000 acres of mining claims covering the ore deposit stockpiles process plant and water wellfield and pipeline in addition el abra has land surface rights for the road between the processing plant and the mine the water wellfield power transmission lines and for the water pipeline from the salar de ascotán aquifer 

el abra currently receives electrical power under a longterm contract with engie energia chile sa water for our el abra processing operations comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascotán aquifer pursuant to regulatory approval we believe el abra has sufficient water rights and regulatory approvals to support current operations for a discussion of risks associated with the availability of water refer to item 1a “risk factors” 

indonesia 

ownership  ptfi is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the republic of indonesia on december 21 2018 we completed the transaction with the indonesia government regarding ptfi’s longterm mining rights and share ownership refer to note 2 for further discussion following the transaction we have a 4876 percent share ownership in ptfi and the remaining 5124 percent share ownership is collectively held by pt indonesia asahan aluminum persero pt inalum also known as mind id an indonesia stateowned enterprise and pt indonesia papua metal dan mineral formerly known as pt indocopper investama which is expected to be owned by pt inalum and the provincialregional government in papua indonesia the arrangements related to the transaction also provide for us and the other pretransaction ptfi shareholders to retain the economics of the 

revenue and cost sharing arrangements under the former rio tinto joint venture as a result our economic interest in ptfi is expected to approximate 81 percent through 2022 

iupk  concurrent with closing the transaction the indonesia government granted ptfi a new special mining license iupk to replace its former contract of work cow enabling ptfi to conduct operations in the grasberg minerals district through 2041 under the terms of the iupk ptfi has been granted an extension of mining rights through 2031 with rights to extend mining rights through 2041 subject to ptfi completing the construction of a new smelter in indonesia within five years of closing the transaction and fulfilling its defined fiscal obligations to the indonesia government the iupk and related documentation contains legal and fiscal terms and is legally enforceable through 2041 in addition we as a foreign investor have rights to resolve investment disputes with the indonesia government through international arbitration refer to note 13 and item 1a “risk factors” for discussion of ptfi’s iupk and risks associated with our indonesia mining operations 

in march 2020 ptfi received a oneyear extension of its export license through march 15 2021 export licenses are valid for one year periods subject to review and approval by the indonesia government every six months depending on smelter construction progress 

indonesia smelter  as a result of covid19 mitigation measures there have been disruptions to work and travel schedules of international contractors and restrictions on access to the proposed physical site of the new smelter in gresik indonesia ptfi continues to discuss with the indonesia government a deferred schedule for the new smelter project as well as other alternatives in light of the ongoing covid19 pandemic and volatile global economic conditions refer to mda note 12 and item 1a “risk factors” for additional discussion of the new smelter project 

grasberg minerals district  ptfi operates in the remote highlands of the sudirman mountain range in the province of papua indonesia which is on the western half of the island of new guinea since 1967 we and our predecessors have been the only operator of exploration and mining activities in the approximately 24600acre operating area the operating area is accessible by portsite facilities arafura sea and by the timika airport the project area includes a 70mile main service road from portsite to the mill complex 

the grasberg minerals district includes the following underground mines that are being operated the grasberg block cave the deep mill level zone dmlz big gossan and the deep ore zone doz the rampup of underground production at the grasberg minerals district in indonesia continues to advance on schedule during 2020 a total of 206 new drawbells were added at the grasberg block cave and dmlz underground mines bringing cumulative open drawbells to over 370 refer to item 1a “risk factors” for discussion of risks associated with development projects and underground mines

the dmlz fleet consists of over 374 pieces of mobile equipment which includes 44 lhd units and 29 haul trucks used in production and development activities 

big gossan underground mine 

the big gossan ore body lies underground and adjacent to the current mill site it is a tabular near vertical ore body with approximate dimensions of 1200 meters along strike and 800 meters down dip with varying thicknesses from 20 meters to 120 meters the mine utilizes a blasthole stoping method with delayed paste backfill stopes of varying sizes are mined and the ore dropped down passes to a truck haulage level trucks are chute loaded and transport the ore to a jaw crusher the crushed ore is then hoisted vertically via a twoskip production shaft to a level where it is loaded onto a conveyor belt the belt carries the ore to one of the main underground conveyors where the ore is transferred and conveyed to the surface stockpiles for processing 

ore milled from the big gossan underground mine averaged 7000 metric tons per day in 2020 6100 metric tons per day in 2019 and 3800 metric tons per day in 2018 production at the big gossan underground mine is expected to continue through 2041 

the big gossan fleet consists of over 95 pieces of mobile equipment which includes 12 lhd units and 9 haul trucks used in development and production activities 

doz underground mine 

the doz ore body lies vertically below the now depleted intermediate ore zone ptfi began production from the doz ore body in 1989 using openstope mining methods but suspended production in 1991 in favor of production from the grasberg open pit production resumed in 2000 using the blockcave method and is at the 3110meter elevation level 

the doz is a mature blockcave mine that previously operated at 80000 metric tons of ore per day current operating rates from the doz underground mine are driven by the value of the incremental doz ore grade compared to the ore from the dmlz and grasberg block cave underground mines ore milled from the doz underground mine averaged 20900 metric tons per day in 2020 25500 metric tons per day in 2019 and 33800 metric tons per day in 2018 production at the doz underground mine is expected to continue through 2022 

the doz fleet consists of 186 pieces of mobile equipment the primary mining equipment directly associated with production includes an available fleet of 40 lhd units and 19 haul trucks the trucks dump into two gyratory crushers and the ore is then conveyed to the surface stockpiles for processing 

grasberg open pit 

ptfi began openpit mining of the grasberg ore body in 1990 the final phase of the grasberg open pit was mined during 2019 including the removal of the open pit ramps in aggregate the grasberg open pit produced over 27 billion pounds of copper and 46 million ounces of gold in the 30year period from 1990 through 2019 

ore milled from the grasberg open pit and stockpiles averaged 400 metric tons per day in 2020 60100 metric tons per day in 2019 and 133300 metric tons per day in 2018 

description of indonesia ore bodies  our indonesia ore bodies are located within and around two main igneous intrusions the grasberg monzodiorite and the ertsberg diorite the host rocks of these ore bodies include both carbonate and clastic rocks that form the ridge crests and upper flanks of the sudirman range and the igneous rocks of monzonitic to dioritic composition that intrude them the igneoushosted ore bodies the grasberg block cave and portions of the doz occur as vein stockworks and disseminations of copper sulfides dominated by chalcopyrite and to a lesser extent bornite the sedimentaryrock hosted ore bodies portions of the doz and all of the big gossan occur as “magnetiterich calciummagnesian skarn” replacements whose location and orientation are strongly influenced by major faults and by the chemistry of the carbonate rocks along the margins of the intrusions 

the copper mineralization in these skarn deposits is dominated by chalcopyrite but higher bornite concentrations are common moreover gold occurs in significant concentrations in all of the district’s ore bodies though rarely visible to the naked eye these gold concentrations usually occur as inclusions within the copper sulfide minerals though in some deposits these concentrations can also be strongly associated with pyrite 

the following diagram indicates the relative elevations in meters of our reported indonesia ore bodies 

the following map which encompasses an area of 42 square kilometers 16 square miles indicates the relative positions and sizes of our reported indonesia ore bodies and their locations 

smelting facilities and other mining properties 

atlantic copper  our wholly owned atlantic copper smelter and refinery is located on land concessions from the huelva spain port authorities which are scheduled to expire in 2039 

the design capacity of the smelter is approximately 300000 metric tons of copper per year and the refinery has a capacity of 286000 metric tons of copper per year atlantic copper’s anode production from its smelter totaled 275900 metric tons of copper in 2020 272000 metric tons in 2019 and 295300 metric tons in 2018 copper cathode production from its refinery totaled 275000 metric tons of copper in 2020 268300 metric tons in 2019 and 283100 metric tons in 2018 

following is the allocation of atlantic copper’s concentrate purchases from unaffiliated third parties and our copper mining operations for the years ended december 31 



atlantic copper’s major maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately every eight years with shorterterm maintenance turnarounds in the interim atlantic copper completed a 79day major maintenance turnaround in 2013 a 16day maintenance turnaround in 2015 a 27day maintenance turnaround in 2017 and a 16day maintenance turnaround in 2019 the next major maintenance turnaround is scheduled for 2022 

pt smelting  ptfi’s former cow required us to construct or cause to be constructed a smelter in indonesia if we and the indonesia government determined that such a project would be economically viable in 1995 following the completion of a feasibility study we entered into agreements relating to the formation of pt smelting an indonesia company and the construction of the copper smelter and refinery in gresik indonesia pt smelting owns and operates the smelter and refinery ptfi owns 25 percent of pt smelting with the remainder owned by mitsubishi 

materials corporation 605 percent mitsubishi corporation rtm japan ltd 95 percent and jx nippon mining  metals corporation 5 percent 

ptfi’s contract with pt smelting requires ptfi to supply 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements at market rates subject to a minimum or maximum treatment charge rate necessary for pt smelting to produce 205000 metric tons of copper annually on a priority basis ptfi may also sell copper concentrate to pt smelting at market rates for quantities in excess of 205000 metric tons of copper annually ptfi supplied 74 percent of pt smelting’s concentrate requirements in 2020 and 90 percent in both 2019 and 2018 

in early 2017 the indonesia government issued new regulations to address exports of unrefined metals including copper concentrate and anode slimes and other matters related to the mining sector these regulations permit the export of anode slimes which is necessary for pt smelting to continue operating in march 2020 pt smelting received a oneyear extension of its anode slimes export license through march 10 2021 and in january 2021 pt smelting received a sixmonth extension of its anodes slimes export license which currently expires july 18 2021 refer to item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

in connection with ptfis commitment to develop additional smelter capacity in indonesia ptfi has advanced discussions with the majority owner of pt smelting regarding an expansion of the smelter to increase smelter concentrate treatment capacity by approximately 30 percent 300000 metric tons of concentrate per year commercial and financial arrangements for this potential project are being advanced 

pt smelting’s anode production from its smelter totaled 276900 metric tons of copper in 2020 246100 metric tons in 2019 and 258800 metric tons in 2018 copper cathode production from its refinery totaled 273000 metric tons of copper in 2020 241200 metric tons in 2019 and 257600 metric tons in 2018 

pt smelting’s maintenance turnarounds which range from two weeks to a month to complete typically are expected to occur approximately every two years with shortterm maintenance turnarounds in the interim pt smelting completed a 30day maintenance turnaround during december 2020 and the next major turnaround is scheduled for the second half of 2022 

miami smelter  we own and operate a smelter at our miami mining operation in arizona the smelter has been operating for over 100 years and has been upgraded numerous times during that period to implement new technologies improve production and comply with air quality requirements in 2018 the miami smelter completed the installation of emission control equipment that allows it to operate in compliance with current air quality standards refer to item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

the miami smelter processes copper concentrate primarily from our north america copper mines concentrate processed through the smelter totaled 764000 metric tons in 2020 641000 metric tons in 2019 and 729900 metric tons in 2018 in addition because sulphuric acid is a byproduct of smelting concentrate the miami smelter is also the most significant source of sulphuric acid for our north america leaching operations 

major maintenance turnarounds are anticipated to occur approximately every two or three years for the miami smelter the miami smelter completed a major maintenance turnaround in the first half of 2019 and the next major maintenance turnaround is scheduled for the first half of 2021   

rod  refining operations  our rod  refining operations consist of conversion facilities located in north america including a refinery in el paso texas and rod mills in el paso texas and miami arizona we refine our copper anode production from our miami smelter at our el paso refinery the el paso refinery has the potential to operate at an annual production capacity of about 900 million pounds of copper cathode which is sufficient to refine all of the copper anode we produce at our miami smelter our el paso refinery also produces nickel carbonate copper telluride and autoclaved slimes material containing gold silver platinum and palladium 

molybdenum conversion facilities  we process molybdenum concentrate at our conversion plants in the us and europe into such products as technicalgrade molybdic oxide ferromolybdenum pure molybdic oxide ammonium molybdates and molybdenum disulfide we operate molybdenum roasters in sierrita arizona fort madison iowa and rotterdam the netherlands and we operate a molybdenum pressureleach plant in bagdad arizona we also produce ferromolybdenum for customers worldwide at our conversion plant located in stowmarket united kingdom 

other north america copper mines  we also have five nonoperating copper mines – ajo bisbee tohono twin buttes and christmas which are located in arizona – that have been on care and maintenance status for several years and would require new or updated environmental studies new permits and additional capital investment which could be significant to return them to operating status 

mining development projects and exploration activities 

capital expenditures for mining operations totaled 20 billion including 12 billion for major projects in 2020 265 billion including 15 billion for major projects in 2019 and 20 billion including 12 billion for major projects in 2018 capital expenditures for major projects during 2020 2019 and 2018 were primarily associated with underground development activities in the grasberg minerals district and the now completed lone star copper leach project refer to mda for projected capital expenditures for the year 2021 

we have several projects and potential opportunities to expand production volumes extend mine lives and develop largescale underground ore bodies as further discussed in mda our nearterm major development projects will focus on the underground development activities in the grasberg minerals district considering the longterm nature and large size of our development projects actual costs and timing could vary from estimates additionally in response to market conditions the timing of our expenditures will continue to be reviewed we continue to review our mine development and processing plans to maximize the value of our mineral reserves 

we continue to plan the development of the kucing liar underground deposit which lies on the southern flank of and underneath the southern portion of the grasberg open pit at the 2605meter elevation level we expect to mine the kucing liar ore body using the blockcave method at a full rate of 90000 metric tons of ore per day we have reviewed alternatives to improve the economics of the deposit by mining the sections of the ore body with lower pyrite content the revised kucing liar reserve plan reduces mill and power capital expenditures as well as improves recoveries the kucing liar project would produce 6 billion pounds of copper and 6 million ounces of gold between 2028 and 2041 aggregate longterm capital cost estimates for development of the kucing liar ore body are projected to approximate 4 billion over an approximate 12year period in 2021 we are proceeding with a feasibility study drilling structure verification geotechnical and metallurgical and metallurgical testwork for the development of these reserves development of the kucing liar block cave could start as early as 2022 with caving and production rampup commencing in 2028 

additionally full development of the underground reserves is expected to require 28 billion expected to be incurred over an approximate 17year period of capital expenditures at our processing facilities to optimize the handling of underground ore from the grasberg block cave dmlz and kucing liar deposits increases in power loads at these processing facilities and the underground mines are expected to require additional power generation with capital expenditures approximating 07 billion for new power generation upgrades to existing transmission lines and refurbishment of the existing three coal units 

our mining exploration activities are generally associated with our existing mines focusing on opportunities to expand reserves and resources to support development of additional future production capacity exploration results continue to indicate opportunities for significant future potential reserve additions in north america and south america exploration spending associated with mining operations totaled 34 million in 2020 77 million in 2019 and 78 million in 2018 refer to mda for projected exploration expenditures for the year 2021 

refer to item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion of risks associated with mine development projects and exploration activities and ptfi’s iupk 

sources and availability of energy natural resources and raw materials 

our copper mining operations require significant amounts of energy principally diesel electricity coal and natural gas most of which is obtained from third parties under longterm contracts energy represented approximately 16 percent of our copper mine site operating costs in 2020 including purchases of approximately 180 million gallons of diesel fuel 7500 gigawatt hours of electricity at our north america and south america copper mining operations we generate all of our power at our indonesia mining operation 700 thousand metric tons of coal for our coal power plant in indonesia and 1 million mmbtu million british thermal units of natural gas at certain of our north america mines based on current cost estimates energy will approximate 18 percent of our copper mine site operating costs in 2021 

our mining operations also require significant quantities of water for mining ore processing and related support facilities the loss of water rights for any of our mines in whole or in part or shortages of water to which we have rights could require us to curtail or shut down mining operations for a further discussion of risks and legal proceedings associated with the availability of water refer to item 1a “risk factors” and item 3 “legal proceedings” 

sulphuric acid is used in the sxew process and is produced as a byproduct of the smelting process at our smelters and from our sulfur burners at the safford mine sulphuric acid needs in excess of the sulphuric acid produced by our operations are purchased from third parties 

human capital 

we are committed to promoting the health safety and wellbeing of our workforce and striving to further strengthen our commitment to promoting an inclusive diverse and agile workplace we believe our global workforce is the foundation of our company’s success the corporate responsibility committee of fcx’s board of directors the board assists the full board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to among other things our policies and implementation programs that govern our approach to management of our human capital 

workforce 

at december 31 2020 we employed approximately 24500 people 11200 in north america 6500 in indonesia 5600 in south america and 1200 in europe and other locations we also had contractors that employ personnel at many of our operations including approximately 20900 at the grasberg minerals district in indonesia 8800 in north america 3400 at our south america mining operations and 700 in europe and other locations 

approximately 38 percent of our global employee population is covered by collective labor agreements cla our operations in indonesia europe and south america are all covered by a minimum of 66 percent representation in north america our workforce is not represented by unions our north america hourly employees choose to work directly with company management rather than through union representation utilizing our guiding principles agreement which sets out how we work together within the values of the company to achieve our collective goals employees represented by unions on december 31 2020 are listed below with the number of employees represented and the expiration date of the applicable union agreements 



a the previous collective labor agreement cla between ptfi and its workers unions expired in september 2019 but remains valid in accordance with indonesia law until a new agreement is reached in december 2020 ptfi reached a new cla with one union effective april 2020 through march 2022 giving all employees the option to reject the new stipulations but no employees have rejected the agreement the second union filed a lawsuit in november 2020 regarding the new cla and the pending decision could modify the agreement additionally in october 2020 ptfi was notified that a third union was established however the organization has not informed ptfi about its membership or organizational details 

b the cla between atlantic copper and its workers unions expired in december 2019 but remains active by mutual agreement from both parties in accordance with spanish law a new agreement is currently under negotiation 

c the cla between stowmarket and its workers union expired in may 2020 but remains active by consensus agreement negotiations for a new cla are ongoing 

we engage openly with our employee and union leadership to negotiate and uphold labor agreements recognizing that prolonged strikes or other work stoppages can adversely affect our business our workforce and regional stakeholders in thirdquarter 2020 we experienced a fiveday laborrelated work stoppage related to covid19 travel restrictions when a group of workers at ptfi staged protests and a blockade restricting access to the main 

road to the mining operations area we reached an amicable resolution with the group of workers while upholding our covid19 safety protocols there were no strikes or lockouts at any of our operations in 2020 

health and safety 

our highest priority is the health safety and wellbeing of our employees and contractors we also instill health and safety processes for our suppliers and the communities where we operate we believe that health and safety considerations are integral to and fundamental for all other functions in our organization and we understand that the health and safety of our workforce is critical to our operational efficiency and longterm success our global health and safety approach “safe production matters” is focused on fatality prevention and continuous improvement through the use of robust management systems empowering safe work behaviors and strengthening our safety culture 

we focus on fatality prevention through the use of data and technology as well as behavioral science principles our framework for managing risks and compliance obligations is certified in accordance with the internationally recognized occupational health and safety assessment ohsas 18001 standard ohsas requires thirdparty sitelevel verification of requirements with a goal to prevent fatalities and reduce incidents this standard is being replaced with the new iso 45001 health and safety management system and companywide conversion currently is expected to be complete in 2021 

as part of our commitment to providing a safe and healthy workplace we strive to provide the training tools and resources needed so our workforce can identify risks and consistently apply effective controls we share information and key learnings about potentially fatal events near misses and best practices throughout the company and engage with industry peers outside the organization to continuously improve our health and safety performance we also review and discuss all fatalities with the corporate responsibility committee and the board 

our objective is to achieve zero workplace fatalities and to decrease injuries and occupational illnesses we measure our safety performance through regularly established benchmarks including our companywide total recordable incident rate trir which includes both employees and contractors in 2020 regrettably we had 5 workplace fatalities and 12 potential fatal events pfes compared to 3 fatalities and 22 pfes in 2019 overall the percentage of high risk incidents has continued to trend down from 23 percent in 2017 11 percent in both 2018 and 2019 and 7 percent in 2020 our 2020 target was to reach a trir of 070 per 200000 manhours worked during 2020 our trir decreased to 069 from 074 in 2019 meeting our 2020 target the metal mining sector industry average per 200000 manhours worked reported by the us mine safety and health administration was 181 in 2019 the metal mining sector industry average for 2020 was not available at the time of this filing 

in response to the covid19 pandemic during 2020 we implemented operating protocols at each of our operating sites to contain and mitigate the risk of spread of covid19 including but not limited to physical distancing travel restrictions sanitizing and frequent testing and monitoring and we obtained specialized medical equipment and set up quarantine and isolation facilities we are committed to the communities where we operate and continue to work closely with them including providing monetary support and inkind contributions of medical supplies and food to support our employees around the world we adjusted our policies for sick leave and other pay practices to encourage ill employees to stay home we also implemented a policy to allow those who can work from home to do so during the pandemic and looking beyond we have committed to maintaining health benefits and offer guidance resources to support mental and physical wellbeing 

employee engagement training and development 

we are committed to fostering a culture that is safetyfocused respectful inclusive and representative of the communities where we operate we operate in regions of varying ethnic religious and cultural backgrounds and we often are the largest employer in our local communities a key to our success is the ability to recruit retain develop and advance talented employees with diverse perspectives 

in addition to the health safety and wellbeing of our global workforce we have prioritized a flexible highly engaged and agile workforce the covid19 pandemic has amplified our focus on the need for and receptivity to innovation across all facets of the business particularly in how we communicate engage and collaborate across our global workforce in a more virtual environment to support our workforce transformation engagement and ongoing talent development we strengthened our human resources department in 2020 and established two new positions chief human resources officer and vice president – transformation and organizational development who maintain specific responsibility for inclusion and diversity efforts 

we are committed to ongoing training and development of our workforce we focus on attracting and retaining talented people by offering quality employment with competitive compensation and opportunities for professional development strategic talent reviews and succession planning occur regularly and across all business areas to support the advancement of our employees we offer training and development programs encouraging advancement from within and continue to promote strong and experienced management talent we leverage both formal and informal programs to identify foster and retain top talent at both the corporate and operations levels 

additionally hiring locally is a commitment we make to the communities surrounding our operations and to our host countries most people employed at our operations are host country nationals we retain expatriate expertise for managerial and technical roles only when it is not available in local communities to further these efforts expatriates receive cultural training upon their arrival to a new location 

inclusion and diversity 

we believe our greatest strength is our people we respect and value the different ideas beliefs experiences talents skills perspectives backgrounds and cultures of our workforce we strive for promote and foster a workplace where everyone feels a sense of belonging is treated with respect and their opinions are valued we believe an inclusive environment gives our people the confidence to speak up share ideas that drive innovation and achieve operational excellence our inclusive environment is the foundation of our highperformance culture and is paramount to the longterm sustainable success of our business we are committed to fostering a culture that is safety focused respectful inclusive and representative of the communities where we operate 

our inclusion and diversity principles align with our core values of safety respect integrity excellence and commitment and are reflected in our principles of business conduct and other related policies in addition to our human resources reorganization in 2020 we formally established a standalone inclusion and diversity policy and formalized a dedicated inclusion and diversity team to specifically support our enhanced focus on our program

community and human rights 

we have adopted policies that govern our working relationships with the communities where we operate and that are designed to guide our practices and programs in a manner that respects human rights and the culture of the local people impacted by our operations 

we continue to make significant expenditures on community development health education training and cultural programs which include 

• comprehensive job training programs 

• clean water and sanitation projects 

• public health programs including malaria control and human immunodeficiency virus 

• agricultural assistance programs 

• small and medium enterprise development programs 

• basic education programs 

• cultural promotion and preservation programs 

• community infrastructure development 

• charitable donations 

in december 2000 we endorsed the joint us state departmentbritish foreign office voluntary principles on human rights and security voluntary principles we participated in developing these voluntary principles with other major natural resource companies and international human rights organizations and they are incorporated into our human rights policy the voluntary principles provide guidelines for our security programs including interaction with hostgovernment security personnel private security contractors and our internal security employees 

our human rights policy most recently updated in december 2020 reflects our commitment to implementing the united nations guiding principles on business and human rights we have embarked on a program to plan and conduct sitelevel human rights impact assessments hria at our global operations 

hrias help us to embed human rights considerations into our business practices including sitelevel sustainable development risk registers we completed a hria at our cerro verde operation in peru in 2017 and at our new mexico mining operations in 2018 we also participate in a multiindustry human rights working group to gain insight from peer companies 

we believe that our social and economic development programs are responsive to the issues raised by the local communities near our areas of operation and help us maintain good relations with the surrounding communities and avoid disruptions of mining operations as part of our ongoing commitment to our community stakeholders we have made and expect to continue making investments in certain social programs including inkind support and administration across our global operations from time to time over the last three years these investments have averaged 121 million per year nevertheless social and political instability in the areas of our operations may adversely impact our mining operations refer to item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

south america  cerro verde has provided a variety of community support projects over the years following engagements with regional and local governments civic leaders and development agencies in 2006 cerro verde committed to support the costs for a new potable water treatment plant to serve arequipa in addition an agreement was reached with the peru government for development of a water storage network that was financed by cerro verde and a distribution network that was financed by the cerro verde civil association 

cerro verde reached an agreement with the regional government of arequipa the national government the local water utility company and other local institutions to allow it to finance engineer and construct a wastewater treatment plant for the city of arequipa which was completed in 2015 the wastewater treatment plant supplements existing water supplies to support cerro verde’s concentrator expansion and also improves the local water quality enhances agriculture products grown in the area and reduces the risk of waterborne illnesses in addition to these projects cerro verde annually makes significant community development investments in the arequipa region 

security matters  consistent with our operating permits in peru and our commitment to protect our employees and property we have taken steps to provide a safe and secure working environment as part of its security program cerro verde maintains its own internal security department both employees and contractors perform functions such as protecting company facilities monitoring shipments of supplies and products assisting in traffic control and aiding in emergency response operations the security department receives human rights and voluntary principles training annually some contractors assigned to protection of expatriate personnel are armed these contractors also receive training in defensive driving and firearms handling cerro verde’s costs for its internal civilian security department totaled 7 million in 2020 9 million in 2019 and 8 million in 2018 

cerro verde like all businesses and residents of peru relies on the peru government for the maintenance of public order upholding the rule of law and the protection of personnel and property the peru government is responsible for employing police personnel and directing their operations cerro verde has limited public security forces in support of its operation with the arrangement defined through a memorandum of understanding with the peru national police cerro verde’s share of support costs for governmentprovided security approximated 1 million in each of the years 2020 2019 and 2018 

indonesia  in 1996 ptfi established the freeport partnership fund for community development the partnership fund through which ptfi has made available funding and technical assistance to support community development initiatives in the areas of health education economic development and local infrastructure ptfi has committed to provide funding through 2041 for the development of the local communities in its area of operations through the partnership fund ptfi recorded costs of 36 million in 2020 28 million in 2019 and 55 million in 2018 for this commitment 

historically the amungme and kamoro community development organization  lembaga pengembangan masyarakat amungme dan kamoro  oversaw disbursement of the program funds ptfi contributed to the partnership fund throughout 2019 ptfi consulted with key stakeholders to restructure the management of the partnership fund in compliance with ptfi’s iupk throughout the restructuring process ptfi continued its contributions to ensure no disruptions in implementation of approved projects beginning in february 2020 the partnership fund is now managed by a legally recognized indonesia foundation  yayasan pemberdayaan masyarakat amungme dan kamoro or ypmak ypmak is governed by a board of governors consisting of seven representatives including four from ptfi 

in addition to the partnership fund ptfi has made and expects to continue making annual investments in public health education community infrastructure and local economic development 

security matters    consistent with our ongoing commitment to protect our employees and property we have taken steps to provide a safe and secure working environment as part of its security program ptfi maintains its own internal civilian security department both employees and contractors are unarmed and perform functions such as protecting company facilities monitoring shipments of supplies and products assisting in traffic control and aiding in emergency response operations the security department receives human rights training annually 

ptfi’s costs for its internal civilian security department totaled 47 million in 2020 52 million in 2019 and 59 million in 2018 

ptfi like all businesses and residents of indonesia relies on the indonesia government for the maintenance of public order upholding the rule of law and protection of personnel and property the grasberg minerals district has been designated by the indonesia government as one of indonesia’s vital national assets this designation results in the police and to a lesser extent the military playing a significant role in protecting the area of our operations the indonesia government is responsible for employing police and military personnel and directing their operations 

from the outset of ptfi’s operations the indonesia government has looked to ptfi to provide logistical and infrastructure support and assistance for these necessary services because of the limited resources of the indonesia government and the remote location of and lack of development in papua ptfi’s financial support of the indonesia government security institutions assigned to ptfi’s operations area represents a prudent response to ptfi’s requirements and commitments to protect its workforce and property better ensuring that personnel are properly fed and lodged and have the logistical resources to patrol ptfi’s roads and secure its area of operations in addition the provision of such support is consistent with our philosophy of responsible corporate citizenship and reflects our commitment to pursue practices that protect and respect human rights 

ptfi’s support costs for the governmentprovided security totaled 22 million in both 2020 and 2019 and 27 million in 2018 this supplemental support consists of various infrastructure and other costs including food housing fuel travel vehicle repairs allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs and community assistance programs conducted by the military and police

mineral reserves 

proven and probable reserves were determined by the use of mapping drilling sampling assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry as more fully discussed below the term “reserve” as used in the reserve data presented here means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination the term “proven reserves” means reserves for which i quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops trenches workings or drill holes ii grade andor quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and iii the sites for inspection sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established the term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced the degree of assurance although lower than that for proven reserves is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 

our mineral reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies we conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk we revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies refer to item 1a “risk factors” for discussion of risks associated with our estimates of proven and probable reserves 

estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves at december 31 2020 were determined using metals price assumptions of 250 per pound for copper 1200 per ounce for gold and 10 per pound for molybdenum 

for the threeyear period ended december 31 2020 lme copper settlement prices averaged 283 per pound london pm gold prices averaged 1477 per ounce and the weekly average price for molybdenum quoted by metals week averaged 1065 per pound 

the estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves presented in the table below represent the estimated metal quantities from which we expect to be paid after application of estimated metallurgical recovery rates and smelter recovery rates where applicable recoverable reserves are that part of a mineral deposit that we estimate can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination 



a estimated consolidated recoverable copper reserves include 17 billion pounds in leach stockpiles and 03 billion pounds in mill stockpiles refer to “mill and leach stockpiles” for further discussion 

b reflects estimates of minerals that can be recovered through 2041 refer to item 1a “risk factors”

in defining our openpit reserves we apply a “variable cutoff grade” strategy the objective of this strategy is to maximize the net present value of our operations we use a “breakeven cutoff grade” to define the insitu reserves for our underground ore bodies the breakeven cutoff grade is defined for a metric ton of ore as that equivalent copper grade once produced and sold that generates sufficient revenue to cover all operating and administrative costs associated with our production 

our copper mines may contain other commercially recoverable metals such as gold molybdenum and silver we value all commercially recoverable metals in terms of a copper equivalent percentage to determine a single cutoff grade copper equivalent percentage is used to express the relative value of multimetal ores in terms of one metal the calculation expresses the relative value of the ore using estimates of contained metal quantities metals prices as used for reserve determination recovery rates treatment charges and royalties our molybdenum properties use a molybdenum cutoff grade 

the table below shows the minimum cutoff grade by process for each of our existing ore bodies as of december 31 2020 



drill hole spacing data is used by mining professionals such as geologists and geological engineers in determining the suitability of data coverage on a relative basis in a given deposit type and mining method scenario so as to achieve a given level of confidence in the resource estimate drill hole spacing is only one of several criteria necessary to establish resource classification drilling programs are typically designed to achieve an optimum sample spacing to support the level of confidence in results that apply to a particular stage of development of a mineral deposit 

the following table sets forth the average drill hole spacing based on average sample distance or drill pattern spacing for proven and probable ore reserves by process type 



production sequencing 

the following chart illustrates our current plans for sequencing and producing our proven and probable reserves at each of our ore bodies and the years in which we currently expect production from each ore body and related stockpiles our proven and probable ore reserves in indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041 and our current mine plan and planned operations are based on the assumption that ptfi will comply with its obligations under the iupk and receive the second 10year extension from 2031 through 2041 refer to item 1a “risk factors” and note 13 for further discussion production volumes are typically lower in the first few years for each ore body as development activities are ongoing and as the mine ramps up to full production and production volumes may also be lower as the mine reaches the end of its life the sequencing dates shown in the chart below include development activity that results in metal production the ultimate timing of the start of production from our undeveloped mines is dependent upon a number of factors including the results of our exploration and development efforts and may vary from the dates shown below in addition we develop our mine plans based on maximizing the net present value from the ore bodies significant additional capital expenditures will be required at many of these mines in order to achieve the lifeofmine plans reflected below 

a the timing of development is still under review 

mill and leach stockpiles 

mill and leach stockpiles generally contain lower grade ores that have been extracted from an ore body and are available for metal recovery mill stockpiles contain sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through milling concentrating smelting and refining or alternatively by concentrate leaching leach stockpiles contain oxide ores and certain secondary sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities 

because it is impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count reasonable estimation methods are employed the quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grades of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles 

expected copper recovery rates for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing the recoverable copper in mill stockpiles once entered into the production process can be produced into copper concentrate almost immediately 

expected copper recovery rates for leach stockpiles are determined using smallscale laboratory tests small to largescale column testing which simulates the production process historical trends and other factors including mineralogy of the ore and rock type total copper recovery in leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low percentage to more than 90 percent depending on several variables including processing methodology processing variables mineralogy and particle size of the rock for newly placed material on active stockpiles as much as 80 percent of total copper recovery may be extracted during the first year and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years processes and recovery rates are monitored regularly and recovery rate estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes 

following are our stockpiles and the estimated recoverable copper contained within those stockpiles as of december 31 2020

mineralized material 

we hold various properties containing mineralized material that we believe could be brought into production should market conditions warrant however permitting and significant capital expenditures would be required before operations could commence at these properties mineralized material is a mineralized body that has been delineated by appropriately spaced drilling andor underground sampling to support the reported tonnage and average metal grades such a deposit cannot qualify as recoverable proven and probable reserves until legal and economic feasibility are confirmed based upon a comprehensive evaluation of development costs unit costs grades recoveries and other material factors accordingly no assurance can be given that the estimated mineralized material not included in reserves will become proven and probable mineral reserves estimated mineralized materials as presented on the following page were assessed using prices of 300 per pound for copper 1200 per ounce for gold 12 per pound for molybdenum and 20 per ounce for silver refer to item 1a “risk factors” for discussion of risks associated with our estimates of mineralized material

• antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult 

financial risks 

fluctuations in the market prices of the commodities we produce primarily copper gold and molybdenum have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in our financial performance and in the trading prices of our common stock and debt extended declines in the market prices of copper gold and to a lesser extent molybdenum could adversely affect our earnings cash flows and asset values and if sustained may adversely affect our ability to repay debt 

our financial results vary with fluctuations in the market prices of the commodities we produce primarily copper and gold and to a lesser extent molybdenum during 2020 the covid19 pandemic and resulting negative impact on the global economy created significant volatility in the financial markets including the copper market in 2020 copper prices ranged from a low of 209 per pound in march 2020 and a high of 361 per pound in december 2020 and with the ongoing covid19 pandemic significant volatility may continue extended declines in market prices of our commodities whether related to the ongoing covid19 pandemic or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and the value of our assets may depress the price of our common stock and may have a material adverse effect on our ability to comply with financial and other covenants in our debt agreements repay our debt and meet our other obligations 

additionally if market prices for our primary commodities decline and remain low for a sustained period of time we may have to revise our operating plans including curtailing or modifying some of our mining and processing operations we may be unable to decrease our costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues in which case we may incur losses and those losses may be material for example in early 2020 we announced revised operating plans in response to the global covid19 pandemic and resulting negative impact on the global economy which resulted in reductions in i operating costs ii capital expenditures iii exploration and administrative costs and iv sales volumes and production from those planned 

fluctuations in commodities prices are caused by varied and complex factors beyond our control including global supply and demand and inventory levels global economic and political conditions international regulatory trade andor tax policies including national tariffs commodities investment activity and speculation interest rates expectations regarding future inflation rates the strength of the us dollar compared to foreign currencies the price and availability of substitute products and changes in technology volatility in global economic growth particularly in developing economies has the potential to adversely affect future demand and prices for commodities geopolitical uncertainty and protectionism have the potential to inhibit international trade and negatively impact business confidence which creates the risk of constraints on our ability to trade in certain markets and has the potential to increase price volatility 

copper prices may be affected by demand from china which is currently the largest consumer of refined copper in the world and by changes in demand for industrial commercial and residential products containing copper china had a major economic shutdown during firstquarter 2020 in connection with its efforts to contain and mitigate the spread of covid19 which resulted in the country’s first reported economic contraction in over 40 years although our sales during 2020 were not significantly affected a slowing in china’s economic growth another widespread covid19 outbreak in china or other pandemic epidemic or endemic health issues the adoption and expansion of trade restrictions changes in chinaus relations or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies are difficult to predict and could adversely affect copper prices demand for our products our costs our customers our suppliers and the us economy which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

copper prices have fluctuated historically with london metal exchange lme copper settlement prices ranging from 209 per pound to 361 per pound during the three years ended december 31 2020 lme copper settlement prices averaged 280 per pound in 2020 272 per pound in 2019 and 296 per pound in 2018 the lme copper settlement price was 351 per pound on december 31 2020 and 357 per pound on january 29 2021 

factors affecting gold prices may include the relative strength of the us dollar to other currencies inflation and interest rate expectations purchases and sales of gold by governments and central banks demand from china and india two of the world ’ s largest consumers of gold and global demand for jewelry containing gold the london bullion market association london pm gold price averaged 1770 per ounce in 2020 1393 per ounce in 2019 and 1268 per ounce in 2018 the london pm gold price was 1888 per ounce on december 30 2020 there was no london pm gold price quote on december 31 2020 and 1864 per ounce on january 29 2021 

the metals week molybdenum dealer oxide weekly average price averaged 869 per pound in 2020 1137 per pound in 2019 and 1193 per pound in 2018 the metals week molybdenum dealer oxide weekly average price was 986 per pound on december 31 2020 and 1038 per pound on january 29 2021 

declines in prices of commodities we sell could result in metals inventory adjustments and impairment charges for our longlived assets during 2020 we recorded unfavorable metals inventory adjustments totaling 96 million associated with lower market prices for copper and molybdenum refer to note 4 for additional information regarding metals inventory adjustments other events that could result in impairment of our longlived assets include but are not limited to decreases in estimated proven and probable mineral reserves and any event that might have a material adverse effect on current and future expected mine production costs 

our debt and other financial commitments may limit our financial and operating flexibility 

at december 31 2020 our total consolidated debt was 97 billion see note 8 and our total consolidated cash was 37 billion we also have various other financial commitments including reclamation and environmental obligations takeorpay contracts and leases for further information see risk factor below relating to mine closure and reclamation regulations and plugging and abandonment obligations related to our remaining oil and gas properties although we have been successful in repaying debt in the past refinancing our bank facilities and issuing new debt securities in capital markets transactions there can be no assurance that we can continue to do so in addition we may incur additional debt in future periods or reduce our holdings of cash and cash equivalents in connection with funding existing operations capital expenditures dividends share repurchases or in pursuing other business opportunities 

our level of indebtedness and other financial commitments could have important consequences to our business including the following 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the industry in which we operate 

• increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic industry and regulatory conditions 

• limiting our ability to fund future working capital capital expenditures general corporate requirements andor material contingencies to engage in future development activities or to otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt 

• requiring us to sell assets to reduce debt or 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt andor fewer financial commitments 

any failure to comply with the financial andor other covenants in our debt agreements may result in an event of default that would allow the creditors to accelerate maturities of the related debt which in turn may trigger crossacceleration or crossdefault provisions in other debt agreements our available cash and liquidity may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our debt instruments that may be accelerated upon an event of default 

as of january 29 2021 our senior unsecured debt was rated “bb“ with a positive outlook by standard  poor’s “bb” with a stable outlook by fitch ratings and “ba1” with a stable outlook by moody’s investors service if we are unable to maintain our indebtedness and financial ratios at levels acceptable to these credit rating agencies or should our business prospects deteriorate  our current credit ratings could be downgraded which could adversely affect the value of our outstanding securities and existing debt and our ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms and could increase our borrowing costs 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic and any future pandemic epidemic endemic or similar public health threats and resulting negative impact on the global economy and financial markets may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations the duration and extent of which is highly uncertain and could be material 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic continues to adversely impact the global economy and is creating significant volatility in the financial markets including the copper markets the duration and scope of and uncertainties associated with the ongoing covid19 pandemic and the related impact on commodity prices our business and the global economy are evolving and beyond our control the extent and duration of adverse impacts that the covid19 pandemic may have on supply demand and prices of the commodities we produce on our suppliers vendors customers and employees and on global financial markets is unknown at this time but could be both material and prolonged prolonged unfavorable economic conditions and any resulting slowed global economic growth including the current us recession may result in lower demand for the commodities we produce as well as the inability of various customers contractors suppliers and other business partners to fulfill their obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic disrupted our 2020 operating plans in april 2020 we announced revised operating plans in response to the global covid19 pandemic and resulting negative impact on the global economy our revised operating plans focused on safeguarding our business in an uncertain public health and economic environment advancing the rampup of underground production at grasberg and advancing initiatives in north america and south america the ongoing covid19 pandemic or any future pandemic epidemic endemic or other similar public health threats could disrupt or change our future operating plans for additional information refer to part 1 item 2 herein 

our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively including because of illness quarantines government actions or other restrictions in connection with the covid19 pandemic we have proactively implemented operating protocols at each of our operating sites to contain and mitigate the risk of spread of covid19 including but not limited to physical distancing travel restrictions sanitizing and frequent health screening and monitoring covid19 cases have been confirmed through testing at our operating sites including ptfi’s remote operating site in papua indonesia despite our efforts to manage these impacts there can be no assurance that our actions will be effective in containing and mitigating the risk of spread or a major outbreak of covid19 at our operating sites additionally although several vaccines for covid19 have been approved there are risks that these vaccines will not be effective against variants of the virus and that these vaccines may not be accepted or widely available in the areas in which we operate due to shortages or other issues with distribution a major outbreak of covid19 at any of our operating sites and particularly at ptfi’s remote operating site could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

actions taken by governmental authorities and third parties to contain and mitigate the risk of spread of covid19 may have an adverse impact on our business for example in midmarch 2020 the peru government issued a supreme decree and declaration of a national emergency in its efforts to contain the outbreak of covid19 and subsequently extended the order through may 10 2020 the peru government also extended the quarantine measures instituted in midmarch 2020 through august 31 2020 for certain cities in peru including arequipa where our cerro verde mine is located to comply with the government’s requirements we temporarily transitioned our cerro verde mine to care and maintenance status and adjusted operations to prioritize critical activities strict health protocols have been implemented and a plan for cerro verde to restore operations was approved by the peru government in secondquarter 2020 cerro verde continued to increase milling rates while operating consistent with our april 2020 revised operating plans and under strict covid19 restrictions and protocols cerro verde expects mill rates to average approximately 360000 metric tons of ore per day in 2021 with the potential to rampup to precovid19 levels approximating 400000 metric tons of ore per day as covid19 restrictions are lifted  

these and other impacts of covid19 or other pandemic epidemic endemic or similar public health threats could also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in these “risk factors” the ultimate impact of covid19 on our business is difficult to predict and depends on factors that are evolving and beyond our control including the scope and duration of the outbreak and recovery including any future resurgences as well as actions taken by governmental authorities and third parties including the distribution effectiveness and acceptance of 

vaccines to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects any of these disruptions could continue to adversely impact our business and results of operations and such adverse impacts could be material 

mine closure and reclamation regulations impose substantial costs on our operations and include requirements that we provide financial assurance supporting those obligations we also have plugging and abandonment obligations related to our remaining oil and gas properties and are required to provide bonds or other forms of financial assurance in connection with those properties changes in or the failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are required by us federal and state laws and regulations to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans for our mining properties if we are unable to do so most of our financial assurance obligations are imposed by state laws that vary significantly by jurisdiction depending on how each state regulates land use and groundwater quality the us environmental protection agency epa and state agencies may also require financial assurance for investigation and remediation actions that are required under settlements of enforcement actions under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 cercla or similar state laws refer to note 12 for additional information regarding our financial assurance obligations 

we are also subject to financial assurance requirements in connection with our remaining oil and gas properties and certain of our previously sold oil and gas properties under both state and federal laws including financial responsibility required under the oil pollution act of 1990 to cover containment and cleanup costs resulting from an oil spill as a result of a significant increase in the number of oil and gas companies experiencing financial distress especially those operating in the outer continental shelf we may have additional exposure if our partners or buyers of our previously owned properties file for bankruptcy andor default on their share of the abandonment obligations in 2016 the us bureau of ocean energy management boem issued revised requirements for lessees operating in federal waters to secure the cost of plugging abandoning decommissioning andor removing wells platforms and pipelines at the end of production the revised requirements eliminate previously provided waivers from requirements to post security in early 2017 the boem announced a delay in the implementation of certain aspects of the rules pending further review and in june 2017 boem further extended the start date for implementation indefinitely on october 16 2020 boem issued a notice of proposed rulemaking and request for comments that proposed to limit the circumstances in which it will require supplemental bonding so that it will apply more narrowly than the 2016 requirements however we may still be subject to significant levels of supplemental bonding the cost for bonds or other forms of assurances can be substantial and there is no assurance that they can be obtained in all cases 

as of december 31 2020 our financial assurance obligations totaled 15 billion for closure and reclamationrestoration costs of us mining sites and 05 billion for plugging and abandonment obligations of our remaining oil and gas properties a substantial portion of our financial assurance obligations are satisfied by freeportmcmoran inc fcx and subsidiary guarantees and financial capability demonstrations our ability to continue to provide guarantees and financial capability demonstrations depends on state and other regulatory requirements our financial performance and our financial condition other forms of assurance such as letters of credit and surety bonds are costly to provide and depending on our financial condition and market conditions may be difficult or impossible to obtain failure to provide the required financial assurance could result in the closure of the affected properties 

the laws and regulations governing mine closure and remediation in a particular jurisdiction and oil and gas properties plugging and abandonment obligations are subject to review at any time and may be amended to impose additional requirements and conditions which may cause our provisions for environmental and asset retirement obligations to be underestimated and could materially affect our financial position or results of operations similarly our implementation of the global industry standard for tailings management the tailings standard discussed below could require changes to our closure and reclamation plans although it is uncertain if these changes would result in material capital or operating cost increases in addition climate change could lead to changes in the physical risks posed to our operations which could result in changes in our closure and reclamation plans to address such risks any modifications to our closure and reclamation plans that may be required to address physical climate risks may materially increase the costs associated with implementing closure and reclamation at any or all of our active or inactive mine sites and the financial assurance obligations related to the same refer to notes 1 and 12 for further discussion of our environmental and asset retirement obligations 

unanticipated litigation or negative developments in pending litigation or with respect to other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

we are involved in numerous legal proceedings and subject to other contingencies that have arisen or may arise in the ordinary course of our business or are associated with environmental issues including those described in note 12 and in item 3 “legal proceedings” involving matters such as remediation restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination claims of personal injury or property damage arising from contamination or from exposure to substances such as lead arsenic asbestos talc uranium and other allegedly toxic substances disputes over water rights and disputes with foreign governments or regulatory authorities over royalties taxes rights and obligations under concession or other agreements or other matters we are also involved periodically in other reviews inquiries investigations and other proceedings initiated by or involving government agencies some of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief from time to time we are involved in disputes over the allocation of environmental remediation obligations at “superfund” and other sites in addition we may be held responsible for the costs of addressing contamination at the site of current or former activities or at third party sites or be held liable to third parties for exposure to hazardous substances should those be identified in the future the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant monetary damages penalties other sanctions or injunctive relief against us limitations on our property rights or regulatory interpretations that increase our operating costs management does not believe based on currently available information that the outcome of any individual legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition although individual or cumulative outcomes could be material to our operating results for a particular period depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period 

we may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to   our defined benefit pension plans 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for certain current and former employees in the us and a few pension plans for nonus locations which provide for specified payments after retirement the major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets investment returns interest rates and mortality rates affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and may cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet a sustained period of low or insufficient investment returns or low interest rates could require us to fund our pension plans to a greater extent than anticipated refer to note 9 for further discussion 

international risks 

our international operations are subject to political economic social and regional risks of doing business in countries outside the us 

we are a usbased mining company with substantial assets located outside of the us risks of conducting business in countries outside the us include 

• delays in obtaining or renewing or the inability to obtain maintain or renew or the renegotiation cancellation revocation or forced modification of existing contracts leases licenses permits or other agreements andor approvals 

• expropriation or nationalization of property protectionism or restrictions on repatriation of earnings or capital 

• changes in the host country’s laws regulations and policies which may be applied retroactively including but not limited to those relating to labor taxation royalties duties tariffs divestment imports exports including restrictions on the export of copper concentrates copper andor gold trade regulations immigration currency and environmental matters including land use and water use which because of rising “resource nationalism” in countries around the world may impose increasingly onerous requirements on foreign operations and investment andor result in fines fees and sanctions imposed for failure to comply with the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate 

• political social and economic instability bribery extortion corruption civil unrest acts of war guerrilla activities insurrection and terrorism certain of which may result in among other things an inability to access our property 

• risk of loss associated with trespass local artisanal or illegal mining theft and vandalism or due to potential pandemic epidemic and endemic health issues 

• changes in us trade tariff tax immigration or other policies that may harm relations with foreign countries or result in retaliatory policies 

• increases in training and other costs and challenges relating to requirements by governmental entities to employ the nationals of the country in which a particular operation is located 

• foreign exchange controls fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and inflation 

• reduced protection for intellectual property rights and 

• the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of an international court or arbitration panel or having to enforce the judgment of an international court or arbitration panel against a sovereign nation 

our insurance does not cover most losses caused by the above described risks accordingly our exploration development and production activities outside of the us may be substantially affected by many unpredictable factors beyond our control some of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

our international operations must comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption and antibribery laws of the other jurisdictions in which we operate there has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of these laws in recent years we operate in jurisdictions that have experienced public and private sector corruption and where significant anticorruption enforcement activities prosecutions and settlements have occurred there can be no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from misinterpretation of or noncompliance with applicable laws and internal policies recklessness fraudulent behavior dishonesty or other inappropriate acts committed by our affiliates employees agents or contractors as such our corporate policies and processes may not prevent or detect all potential breaches of law or other governance practices any violation of anticorruption or antibribery laws could result in significant criminal or civil fines and penalties litigation and loss of operating licenses or permits and may damage our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

we conduct international mining operations in indonesia peru and chile and exploration activities in various foreign jurisdictions accordingly in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in countries outside the us our business may be adversely affected by political economic social and regional uncertainties in each of these countries for example we are involved in several significant tax proceedings and other tax disputes with indonesia and peru tax authorities refer to note 12 for further discussion of these matters other risks specific to certain countries in which we operate are discussed in more detail below 

because our mining operations in indonesia are a significant operating asset our business may be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties in indonesia 

our indonesia mining operations include the grasberg minerals district one of the world’s largest copper and gold deposits these operations are conducted by our subsidiary ptfi pursuant to a special mining license iupk issued by the indonesia government refer to note 13 for a summary of the iupk’s key fiscal terms 

maintaining a good working relationship with the indonesia government is important because of the significance of our indonesia operations to our business and because our mining operations there are among indonesia’s most significant business enterprises the grasberg minerals district has been designated by the indonesia government as one of indonesia’s vital national assets partially because of its significance to indonesia’s economy the environmentally sensitive area where it is located and the number of people employed our indonesia operations have been the subject of political debates and criticism in the indonesia press and have been the target of protests and occasional violence improper management of our working relationship with the indonesia government could lead to a disruption of operations andor impact our reputation in indonesia and in the region where we operate 

which could adversely affect our business in addition pt indonesia asahan aluminium persero pt inalum also known as mind id a shareholder in ptfi is an indonesia stateowned enterprise disputes between us and pt inalum may result in litigation or arbitration which could increase our expenses and distract our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business and could create tensions with the indonesia government 

the indonesia mining industry is subject to extensive regulation within indonesia and there have been major developments in laws and regulations applicable to mining concession holders some of which have conflicted with ptfi’s contractual rights in the past in particular the enactment of law no 4 of 2009 on coal and mineral mining on january 12 2009 the mining law replaced the previous regulatory framework which allowed concession holders including ptfi to conduct mining activities in indonesia under a contract of work system the mining law which sets out the regulatory framework for the mining industry in indonesia only contains substantive principles and leaves many specific issues to be addressed in implementing regulations some of which have conflicted with ptfi’s contractual rights in the past including but not limited to regulations that imposed a progressive export duty on copper concentrate restricted exports of copper concentrate and anode slimes increased royalty rates and required payment of a smelter assurance bond to support a commitment to construct a new smelter in indonesia refer to note 13 for further discussion of the smelter assurance bond 

notwithstanding provisions in ptfi’s former contract of work cow prohibiting it from doing so the indonesia government sought to modify ptfi’s former cow to address provisions contained in the mining law and implementing regulations adopted thereunder some of which were not required under or conflicted with ptfi’s former cow including but not limited to i restrictions on ptfi’s basic right to export mining products ii imposition of additional export duties and higher royalty rates iii imposition of excess surface water taxes refer to note 12 iv imposition of new requirement to build additional smelter capacity in indonesia v unreasonable withholding and delay in granting approval of two successive tenyear extensions of the term of the former cow and vi imposition of new divestment requirements 

in early 2017 the indonesia government issued new regulations to address exports of unrefined metals including copper concentrate and anode slimes and other matters related to the mining sector ptfi’s export license for copper concentrate is valid for one year periods subject to review and approval by the indonesia government every six months depending on smelter construction progress ptfi’s export license expires on march 15 2021 refer to mda and note 12 for further discussion of the administrative fine levied by the indonesia government on ptfi for failing to achieve physical development progress on the new smelter and ongoing discussions with the indonesia government regarding a deferred schedule for the completion of the new smelter project as well as other alternatives in light of the ongoing covid19 pandemic and volatile global economic conditions the 2017 regulations also permit the export of anode slimes which is necessary for pt smelting ptfi’s 25percentowned copper smelter and refinery located in gresik indonesia to continue operating pt smelting’s export license for anode slimes expires on july 18 2021 in addition to a delay in the renewal of its export license for anode slimes in 2017 pt smelting’s operations were shut down from midjanuary 2017 until early march 2017 as a result of labor disturbances copper concentrate sales to pt smelting totaled over 10 percent of our consolidated revenues for each of the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 we cannot predict when ptfi’s copper concentrate license and pt smelting’s anode slimes export license may be renewed ptfi’s sale of concentrates could be interrupted if either of these export license is not timely renewed or if pt smelting is unable to operate either due to other operational or financial constraints which would adversely impact our revenues and operations 

we cannot assure you that future regulatory changes affecting the mining industry in indonesia will not be introduced or unexpectedly repealed or that new interpretations of existing laws and regulations will not be issued which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we will not mine all of ptfi’s ore reserves in the grasberg minerals district before the initial term of ptfi’s iupk expires in 2031 and the iupk may not be extended through 2041 if ptfi fails to abide by the terms and conditions of the iupk and applicable laws and regulations 

on december 21 2018 ptfi was granted an iupk to replace its former cow enabling ptfi to conduct operations in the grasberg minerals district through 2041 under the terms of the iupk ptfi has been granted mining rights through 2031 with rights to extend its mining rights through 2041 subject to among other things ptfi completing the construction of a new smelter in indonesia by december 21 2023 an extension of which has been requested due to covid19 mitigation measures subject to the approval of the indonesia government and 

fulfilling its defined fiscal obligations to the indonesia government refer to note 13 for a summary of the iupk’s key fiscal terms 

the iupk also requires ptfi to pay duties on concentrate exports of 5 percent declining to 25 percent when smelter development progress exceeds 30 percent and eliminated when smelter development progress exceeds 50 percent refer to mda and note 12 for further discussion of the administrative fine levied by the indonesia government on ptfi for failing to achieve physical development progress on the new smelter and ongoing discussions with the indonesia government regarding a deferred schedule for the completion of the new smelter project as well as other alternatives in light of the ongoing covid19 pandemic and volatile global economic conditions engineering and frontend engineering and design for the selected process technology are ongoing the preliminary capital cost estimate for the project approximates 3 billion and ptfi plans to arrange financing for the project the economics of the new smelter will be borne by ptfi’s shareholders according to their respective share ownership percentages ptfi’s ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions future market prices as well as ptfi’s operational performance cash flow and debt position among other factors financing may not be available when needed or if available the terms of such financing may not be favorable to ptfi 

our proven and probable ore reserves in indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041 and ptfi’s current longterm mine plan and planned operations are based on the assumption that ptfi will abide by the terms and conditions of the iupk and will be granted the 10year extension from 2031 through 2041 as a result we will not mine all of these ore reserves during the initial term of the iupk prior to the end of 2031 we expect to mine 50 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable ore at december 31 2020 representing 57 percent of our net equity share of recoverable copper reserves and 59 percent of our net equity share of recoverable gold reserves 

if ptfi does not complete the construction of a new smelter in indonesia by december 21 2023 an extension of which has been requested due to covid19 mitigation measures subject to the approval of the indonesia government or fulfill its defined fiscal obligations to the indonesia government as set forth in the iupk the iupk will likely not be extended from 2031 to 2041 and we would be unable to mine all of ptfi’s ore reserves in the grasberg minerals district which would adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position 

operational risks 

our mining operations are subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our business and our underground mining operations can be particularly dangerous 

our mines are very large in scale and by their nature are subject to significant operational risks some of which are outside of our control and many of which are not covered fully or in some cases even partially by insurance these operational risks which could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and cash flow include earthquakes rainstorms floods and other natural disasters environmental hazards including discharge of metals concentrates pollutants or hazardous chemicals surface or underground fires equipment failures accidents including in connection with mining equipment milling equipment or conveyor systems transportation of chemicals explosives or other materials and in the transportation of employees and business partners to and from sites wall failures and rock slides in our openpit mines and structural collapses of our underground mines or tailings impoundments lower than expected ore grades or recovery rates and unexpected geological formations or conditions whether in mineral or gaseous form 

for a discussion of risks specific to our tailings management see below “ our management of waste rock and tailings are subject to significant environmental safety and engineering challenges and risks that could adversely affect our business” 

we are facing continued geotechnical challenges due to the older age of some of our openpit mines and a trend toward mining deeper pits and more complex deposits no assurances can be given that unanticipated geotechnical and hydrological conditions may or may not occur nor whether these conditions may lead to events such as landslides and pit wall failures in the future or that such events will be detected in advance geotechnical instabilities can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control such as seismic activity or severe weather which may lead to floods mudslides pitwall instability and possibly even slippage of material during the first quarter of 2019 our el abra operation in chile experienced heavy rainfall and electrical storms as a result our operating results for 2019 were impacted by a suspension of el abra’s crushed 

leach stacking operations for approximately 35 days we cannot predict whether similar events will occur in the future or the extent to which any such event would affect this or any of our other operations 

underground mining operations can be particularly dangerous and in may 2013 a tragic accident which resulted in 28 fatalities and 10 injuries occurred at ptfi when the rock structure above the ceiling of an underground training facility collapsed ptfi temporarily suspended mining and processing activities at the grasberg complex to conduct inspections and resumed openpit mining and concentrating activities in june 2013 and underground operations in july 2013 no assurance can be given that similar events will not occur in the future 

in addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry our indonesia mining operations involve additional risks given their location in steep mountainous terrain in a remote area of indonesia these conditions have required us to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities the area also receives extreme rainfall which has led to periodic floods and mudslides further the mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time 

we maintain insurance at amounts we believe to be reasonable to cover some of these risks and hazards however our insurance may not sufficiently cover losses from certain natural or operating disasters no assurance can be given that such insurance will continue to be available or that it will be available at economically feasible premiums or that we will be able to obtain or maintain such insurance we may elect to not purchase insurance for certain risks due to the high premium costs associated with insuring such risk or for various other reasons we do not have coverage for certain environmental losses and other risks as such coverage generally cannot be purchased at a commercially reasonable cost by us or other companies within the mining industry the lack of or insufficiency of insurance coverage could adversely affect our cash flow and overall profitability 

the occurrence of one or more of these events in connection with our exploration activities and development of and production from mining operations may result in the death of or personal injury to our employees other personnel or third parties the loss of mining equipment damage to or destruction of mineral properties or production facilities significant repair costs monetary losses deferral or unanticipated fluctuations in production extensive community disruption loss of licenses permits or necessary approvals to operate loss of infrastructure and services disruption to essential supplies or delivery of our products environmental damage and potential legal liabilities all of which may adversely affect our reputation business prospects results of operations and financial position 

our management of waste rock and tailings are subject to significant environmental safety and engineering challenges and risks that could adversely affect our business 

the waste rock including overburden and tailings produced in our mining operations represent our largest volume of waste material managing the volume of waste rock and tailings presents significant environmental safety and engineering challenges and risks primarily relating to structural stability geochemistry water quality and dust generation management of this waste is regulated in the jurisdictions where we operate and our programs are designed to comply with applicable national state and local laws permits and approved environmental impact studies 

we maintain large leach pads and tailings impoundments containing viscous material tailings impoundments include large embankments that must be engineered constructed and monitored to ensure structural stability and avoid leakages or structural collapse our tailings impoundments in arid areas must have effective programs to suppress fugitive dust emissions and we must effectively monitor and treat acid rock drainage at all of our operations in indonesia we use a river transport system for tailings management which presents other risks discussed in more detail below under environmental and social risks  “ our indonesia mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges and future changes in environmental laws or unanticipated environmental impacts from those operations could require us to incur increased costs ” 

affiliates of our company currently operate 17 tailings storage facilities 15 in the us and 2 in peru and manage 56 tailings storage facilities in the us that are inactive or closed approximately threefourths of the inactive facilities have been closed our inventory of tailings storage facilities comprises 12 active and 51 inactive or closed facilities with an upstream design and 5 active and 5 inactive with a centerline design in 2020 we produced approximately 259 million metric tons of tailings the failure of tailings and other embankments at any of our mining operations could cause severe and in some cases catastrophic property and environmental damage and loss of life as well as adverse effects on our business and reputation many of our tailings storage facilities are located in areas where a failure has the potential to impact individual dwellings and a limited number of impoundments are in areas where a 

failure has the potential to impact nearby communities or mining infrastructure as a result our programs take into account the significant consequences resulting from a potential failure and we apply substantial financial resources and internal and external technical resources to pursue the safe management of all those facilities our tailings management and stewardship program which involves qualified external engineers of record and periodic oversight by independent tailings technical review boards and our tailings stewardship team complies with the tailings governance framework on preventing catastrophic failure of tailings storage facilities adopted in december 2016 by the international council on mining and metals icmm an industry group of which we are a founding member and required to be implemented by icmm members we continue to enhance our existing practices and work with icmm on additional initiatives to strengthen the design operation and closure of tailings storage facilities in an effort to reduce the risk of severe or catastrophic failure of those facilities however no assurance can be given that these events will not occur in the future 

the importance of careful design management and monitoring of large impoundments has been emphasized in recent years by large scale tailings dam failures at unaffiliated mines which resulted in numerous fatalities and caused extensive property and environmental damage as a result of failures at unaffiliated mines in 2019 international groups initiated the drafting of standards for the safe management of tailings facilities in august 2020 the coconveners of the global tailings review which included icmm published the tailings standard the tailings standard includes 77 requirements across 6 key areas including the design construction operation and monitoring of tailings facilities management and governance emergency response and longterm recovery and public disclosure icmm has committed that members will implement the tailings standard within three years for certain facilities and within five years for all others icmm members have prepared a guidance document focused on practices that drive safe tailings management and prepared a conformance protocol document to be used by companies on demonstrating implementation of the tailings standard both documents are expected to be published in early 2021 as an icmm member management has committed to implement the tailings standard at our tailings storage facilities including providing required public disclosures regarding our facilities and efforts we are evaluating changes to our tailings stewardship and management programs and approaches that may be needed to demonstrate conformance with the tailings standard although it is uncertain if changes would result in material capital or operating cost increases 

in addition changes in physical risks to our facilities resulting from climate change could lead to changes in our plans for managing tailings and waste rock in order to address such risks which may materially increase the costs associated with managing waste rock and tailings at any or all of our active or inactive mine sites addressing the effects of climate change on tailings facilities is a requirement under the tailings standard 

based on observations from such tailings failures at unaffiliated mines in addition to fatalities and severe personal property and environmental damages these events could result in limited or restricted access to mine sites suspension of operations decrease in reserves legal liability possibly involving the freezing of assets government investigations additional regulations and restrictions on mining operations in response to any such failure increased monitoring costs and production costs increased insurance costs or inability to obtain insurance increased costs andor limited access to capital remediation costs inability to comply with any additional safety requirements or obtain necessary certifications evacuation or relocation of communities or other emergency action and other impacts which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position 

violence including shooting incidents civil and religious strife and activism could result in loss of life andor disrupt our operations and may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

indonesia has long faced separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces several separatist groups have sought increased political independence for the province of papua where our grasberg minerals district is located in papua there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the indonesia military and police in addition illegal miners have periodically clashed with police who have attempted for years to move them away from our facilities social economic and political instability in papua could materially and adversely affect us if it results in damage to our property or interruption of our indonesia operations 

in 2009 a series of shooting incidents occurred within the ptfi project area including along the road leading to our mining and milling operations the shooting incidents continued on a sporadic basis through january 2020 during this time there were 22 fatalities and more than 75 injuries to our employees contractor employees government 

security personnel and civilians in addition in december 2018 a mass shooting incident targeting a highway construction crew occurred in a remote mountain area approximately 100 miles east of the ptfi project area resulting in at least 19 fatalities and several reported as missing during firstquarter 2020 and april 2020 there was an escalation in shooting incidents in ptfi’s area of operations in late march 2020 a shooting incident occurred near ptfi’s administrative offices in the lowlands in papua indonesia resulting in the death of one ptfi employee and injuries to two other workers in january 2021 another shooting incident occurred when a helicopter operating under contract to ptfi was struck by a single gunshot separatist security incidents including shootings continue to be sporadically reported and ptfi continues to monitor the occurrence of incidents in the region 

the safety of our workforce is a critical concern and ptfi continues to work with the indonesia government to enhance security and address security issues within the ptfi project area and in nearby areas we continue to limit the use of the road leading to our mining and milling operations to secured convoys including transport of personnel by armored vehicles in designated areas 

we cannot predict whether additional incidents will occur that could result in loss of life disrupt or suspend our operations if other disruptive incidents occur they could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in ways that we cannot predict at this time 

south america countries have historically experienced uneven periods of economic growth as well as recession periods of high inflation and general economic and political instability during 2019 and 2020 both peru and chile experienced significant and prolonged civil unrest unrelated to our operations production and sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 were impacted by protests associated with an unaffiliated copper development project in peru that blocked access to the shipping ports and main transportation routes although the civil unrest did not significantly impact our results for 2019 similar events in the future could cause our south america operations to be materially impacted in which case we may not be able to meet our production and sales targets we cannot predict whether similar or more significant incidents of civil unrest will occur in the future in peru or chile 

our business depends on good relations with our workforce and labor disputes or labor unrest could disrupt our operations from time to time which could adversely affect our financial results 

our business is dependent in part on maintaining good relations with our workforce a significant portion of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates refer to items 1 and 2 “business and properties” of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding labor matters and expiration dates of such agreements as of december 31 2020 approximately 38 percent of our global labor force was covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 16 percent of our global labor force was covered by agreements that have expired and are currently being negotiated or will expire during 2021 

labor agreements are negotiated on a periodic basis and may not be renewed on reasonably satisfactory terms to us or at all if we do not successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements with our union workers we may incur prolonged strikes and other work stoppages at our mining operations which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations additionally if we enter into a new labor agreement with any union that significantly increases our labor costs relative to our competitors our ability to compete may be materially and adversely affected 

we could experience labor disruptions such as work stoppages work slowdowns union organizing campaigns strikes or lockouts that could adversely affect our operations for example during thirdquarter 2016 ptfi experienced labor productivity issues and a 10day work stoppage which continued during fourthquarter 2016 and into the first half of 2017 beginning in midapril 2017 ptfi experienced a high level of worker absenteeism which unfavorably impacted mining and milling rates and in may 2017 a significant number of employees and contractors elected to participate in an illegal strike action these employees were subsequently deemed to have voluntarily resigned under existing indonesia laws and regulations resulting in increased costs associated with employee severance in thirdquarter 2020 we experienced a fiveday laborrelated work stoppage related to covid19 travel restrictions when a small group of workers at ptfi staged protests and a blockade restricting access to the main road to the mining operations area we reached an amicable resolution with the group of workers while upholding our covid19 safety protocols there were no strikes or lockouts at any of our operations in 2020 

we cannot predict whether additional labor disruptions will occur significant reductions in productivity or protracted work stoppages at one or more of our operations could significantly reduce our production and sales volumes or disrupt operations which could adversely affect our cash flow results of operations and financial condition 

our mining operations depend on the availability of significant quantities of secure water supplies 

our mining operations require physical availability and secure legal rights to significant quantities of water for mining and ore processing activities and related support facilities most of our north america and south america mining operations are in areas where competition for water supplies is significant and where climate change may lead to increasing scarcity of water resources in the future continuous production at our mines is dependent on many factors including our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies 

as discussed in item 3 “legal proceedings” in arizona where our operations use both surface water and groundwater we are a participant in an active adjudication in which arizona courts have been attempting for over 45 years to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for the gila river watershed one of the state’s largest river systems this adjudication primarily affects our morenci safford and sierrita mines the adjudication is addressing the state law claims of thousands of competing users including us as well as significant federal water claims that are potentially adverse to the state law claims of both surface water and groundwater users groundwater is treated differently than surface water under arizona law which historically allowed land owners to pump subsurface water subject only to the requirement of putting it to “reasonable use” however court decisions in the adjudication have concluded that some as yet undetermined volume of subsurface underground water constitutes “subflow” that is to be treated legally as surface water rather than groundwater and is therefore subject to the arizona doctrine of prior appropriation first in time first in right and subject to the adjudication and potentially unavailable to groundwater pumpers including us in the absence of valid surface water claims a recharacterization of groundwater as surface water could affect the ability of consumers farmers ranchers municipalities and industrial users like us to continue to access water supplies that have been relied on for decades because we are a user of both groundwater and surface water in arizona we are an active participant in the adjudication proceedings given the legal and technical complexity of these adjudications their long history and their longterm legal economic and political implications it is difficult to predict the timing or the outcome of these proceedings if we are not able to satisfactorily resolve the issues being addressed in the adjudications our ability to pump groundwater could be diminished or curtailed and our operations at morenci safford and sierrita could be adversely affected unless we are able to acquire alternative resources 

water for our cerro verde operation in peru comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the rio chili watershed that collects water primarily from seasonal precipitation and from wastewater collected from the city of arequipa and treated at a wastewater treatment plant as a result of occasional drought conditions temporary supply shortages that could affect our cerro verde operations are possible 

water for our el abra mining operation in chile comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascotán aquifer in 2010 el abra obtained regulatory approval for the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascotán aquifer for its sulfide processing plant which began operations in 2011 our current permit will expire in 2029 unless we are able to renew it again the agreement to pump from this aquifer is subject to continued monitoring of the aquifer level to ensure that environmentally sensitive areas are not impacted by our pumping if impact occurs we would have to reduce pumping to restore water levels which could have an adverse effect on production from el abra 

although we typically have sufficient water for our indonesia operations the area receives considerable rainfall that makes us susceptible to periodic floods and mudslides the nature and magnitude of which cannot be predicted 

although each of our mining operations currently has access to sufficient water supplies to support current operational demands as discussed above some supplies are subject to adjudication proceedings the outcome of which we cannot predict and the availability of additional supplies that may be required for potential future expansions is uncertain while we are taking actions to acquire additional backup water supplies such supplies may not be available at acceptable cost or at all so that the loss of a water right or currently available water supply could force us to curtail operations or force premature closures thereby increasing andor accelerating costs or foregoing profitable operations 

development projects are inherently risky and may require more capital than anticipated which could adversely affect our business the development of our underground mines and operations are also subject to other unique risks 

mine development projects typically require a number of years and significant expenditures during the development phase before production is possible currently our major projects include underground development activities in the grasberg minerals district which currently constitutes approximately 29 percent of our estimated consolidated recoverable proven and probable copper reserves there are many risks and uncertainties inherent in all development projects including but not limited to unexpected or difficult geological formations or conditions potential delays cost overruns lower levels of production during rampup periods shortages of material or labor construction defects breakdowns and injuries to persons and property the development of our underground mines and operations are also subject to other unique risks including but not limited to underground fires or floods ventilating harmful gases fallofground accidents and seismic activity resulting from unexpected or difficult geological formations or conditions while we anticipate taking all measures that we deem reasonable and prudent in connection with the development of our underground mines to safely manage production there is no assurance that these risks will not cause schedule delays revised mine plans injuries to persons and property or increased capital costs any of which may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition additionally although we devote significant time and resources to our project planning approval and review processes many of our development projects are highly complex and rely on factors that are outside of our control which may cause us to underestimate the time and capital required to complete a development project 

for example we experience mining induced seismic activity from time to time at the deep mill level zone dmlz underground mine in the grasberg minerals district results to date of hydraulic fracturing activities to manage rock stresses and precondition the dmlz underground mine for largescale production have been effective however we cannot predict whether additional occurrences of seismic activity or other unexpected geological activity will occur that could cause schedule delays or additional revisions to ptfi’s mine plans which could adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

we must continually replace reserves depleted by production but exploration is highly speculative and our exploration activities may not result in additional discoveries 

our existing mineral reserves will be depleted over time by production from our operations because our profits are primarily derived from our mining operations our ability to replenish our mineral reserves is essential to our longterm success depleted reserves can be replaced in several ways including expanding known ore bodies reducing operating costs that could extend the life of a mine by allowing us to costeffectively process ore types that were previously considered uneconomic by locating new deposits or acquiring interests in reserves from third parties exploration is highly speculative in nature involves many risks and uncertainties requires substantial capital expenditures and is frequently unsuccessful in discovering significant mineralization accordingly our current or future exploration programs may not result in the discovery of additional deposits that can be produced profitably even if significant mineralization is discovered it will likely take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production during which time the economic feasibility of production may change we may not be able to discover enhance develop or acquire reserves in sufficient quantities to maintain or grow our current reserve levels which could negatively affect our cash flow results of operations and financial condition 

estimates of proven and probable reserves and mineralized material are uncertain and the volume and grade of ore actually recovered may vary from our estimates 

our estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves have been prepared in accordance with industry guide 7 as required by the securities exchange act of 1934 there are numerous uncertainties inherent in mineral reserves estimates such estimates are to a large extent based on assumed longterm prices for the commodities we produce primarily copper gold and molybdenum and interpretations of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other exploration techniques which data may not necessarily be indicative of future results our mineral reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies we conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk we revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies geological assumptions about our mineralization that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available 

estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves or the cost at which we anticipate such mineral reserves will be recovered are based on uncertain assumptions the uncertain global financial outlook may affect economic assumptions related to reserve recovery and may require reserve revisions changes to such estimates could affect our asset carrying values and may also negatively impact our future financial condition and results 

in addition if the market prices for the commodities we produce decline from recent levels if production costs increase or recovery rates decrease or if applicable laws and regulations are adversely changed we can offer no assurance that the indicated level of recovery will be realized or that mineral reserves can be mined or processed profitably if we determine that certain of our estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves have become uneconomic this may ultimately lead to a reduction in our aggregate reported mineral reserves which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

additionally the term “mineralized material” does not indicate recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as defined by the us securities and exchange commission sec estimates of mineralized material are subject to further exploration and potential development and therefore are subject to considerable uncertainty mineralized material is a mineralized body that has been delineated by appropriately spaced drilling andor underground sampling to support the reported tonnage and average metal grades such a deposit cannot qualify as recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves until legal and economic feasibility are confirmed based upon a comprehensive evaluation of development costs unit costs grades recoveries and other material factors accordingly no assurance can be given that the estimated mineralized material not included in reserves will become recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves 

in 2018 the sec adopted amendments to the disclosure requirements for mining registrants we will be required to comply with the new rules beginning with our annual report on form 10k for fiscal year 2021 future adjustment to estimates of mineral reserves or mineralized material may occur as a result of the differing standards under the new requirements including but not limited to the replacement of our estimate of mineralized material with an estimate of “mineral resources” 

our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations some of which require permits and other approvals compliance with these regulations increases our costs and in the event of an alleged violation may delay or result in a suspension of our operations 

our operations are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations that are subject to change and to changing interpretation by governmental agencies and other bodies vested with broad supervisory authority as a mining company compliance with environmental legal requirements is an integral and costly part of our business for additional information see “environmental and social risks” below we are also subject to extensive regulation of worker health and safety including the requirements of the us occupational safety and health act and similar laws of other jurisdictions in the us the operation of our mines is subject to regulation by the us mine safety and health administration msha under the federal mine safety and health act of 1977 mine act msha inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the mine act additionally in the us various state agencies have concurrent jurisdiction arising under state law that regulate worker health and safety in both our industrial facilities and mines if regulatory inspections result in an alleged violation we may be subject to fines and penalties and in instances of alleged significant violations our mining operations or industrial facilities could be subject to temporary or extended closures refer to exhibit 951 to this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding certain orders and citations issued by msha for our operations during the year ended december 31 2020 

many other governmental bodies regulate other aspects of our operations and our failure to comply with these legal requirements can result in substantial penalties in addition new laws and regulations including executive orders or changes to or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations by courts or regulatory authorities occur regularly but are difficult to predict changes under a new president administration and congress in the us are also difficult to predict any such variations could negatively impact the mining sector including our business substantially increase costs to achieve compliance or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow results of operations and financial condition 

our business is dependent upon information technology systems which may be adversely affected by disruptions damage failure and risks associated with implementation and integration 

our industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies our strategy of operating large longlived geographically diverse assets has been increasingly dependent on our ability to become fully integrated and highly automated many of our business and operational processes are heavily dependent on traditional and emerging technology systems to conduct daytoday operations improve safety and efficiency and lower costs 

as our dependence on information systems including those of our third party service providers and vendors grows we become more vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks in recent years cybersecurity incidents have increased in frequency and magnitude these incidents may include but are not limited to installation of malicious software phishing credential attacks unauthorized access to data and other advanced and sophisticated cybersecurity breaches and threats including threats that increasingly target critical operational technologies and process control networks if any of these threats materialize we could be subject to manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks production downtimes communication interruption or other disruptions and delays to our operations or to the transportation of products or infrastructure utilized by our operations unauthorized release of proprietary commercially sensitive confidential or otherwise protected information the corruption of data significant health and safety consequences environmental damage loss of intellectual property fines and litigation damage to our reputation or financial losses from remedial actions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow results of operations and financial condition we have experienced targeted and nontargeted cybersecurity incidents in the past and may experience them in the future while these cybersecurity incidents did not result in any material loss to us or interrupt our daytoday operations there can be no assurance that we will not experience any such losses in the future given the unpredictability of the timing and the evolving nature and scope of information technology disruptions the various procedures and controls we use to monitor and protect against these threats and to mitigate our potential risks to such threats may not be sufficient in preventing cybersecurity incidents from materializing further as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities to cybersecurity threats 

we could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective not installed properly or not properly integrated into our operations various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to system implementation and modification but system modification failures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations and could if not successfully implemented adversely impact the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 

environmental and social risks 

our operations are subject to complex evolving and increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations compliance with environmental regulatory requirements involves significant costs and may constrain existing operations or expansion opportunities 

our operations both in the us and internationally are subject to extensive and complex environmental laws and regulations governing the generation storage treatment transportation and disposal of hazardous substances solid waste disposal air emissions wastewater discharges remediation restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination including mine closures and reclamation well plug and abandonment requirements protection of endangered and protected species and designation of critical habitats and other related matters in addition we must obtain regulatory permits and approvals to start continue and expand operations 

our miami arizona smelter processes a significant portion of the copper concentrate produced by our north america copper mines epa regulations required us to invest approximately 230 million in 2017 for new pollution control equipment to reduce sulfur dioxide so 2  to meet both regional haze requirements and to allow the arizona department of environmental quality adeq to demonstrate compliance with epa’s so 2 ambient air quality standards in addition epa is currently in the process of revising the standards for hazardous air pollutants from primary copper smelters which could impose additional requirements on our operations we cannot guarantee that we will not be required to modify our systems or install additional equipment to address findings new requirements or for other reasons which could result in significant costs including increased capital expenditures and operating costs and could adversely impact our business 

laws such as cercla and similar state laws may expose us to joint and several liability for environmental damages caused by our operations or by previous owners or operators of properties we acquired or are currently operating or at sites where we previously sent materials for processing recycling or disposal as discussed in more detail in the below risk factor  “we incur significant costs for remediating environmental conditions on properties that have not been operated in many years” we have substantial obligations for environmental remediation on mining properties previously owned or operated by freeport minerals corporation fmc and certain of its affiliates noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in material penalties or other liabilities in addition compliance with these laws may from time to time result in delays in or changes to our development or expansion plans compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs which we expect will continue to increase over time because of increased regulatory oversight adoption of increasingly stringent environmental standards and other factors 

new or revised environmental regulatory requirements are frequently proposed many of which result in substantially increased costs for our business including those regarding financial assurance in the financial risks above for example criteria for manmade organic compounds that could be present in soil groundwater and surface water at our existing and former operations are currently under review by federal and state agencies including drinking water regulation of perfluorooctanesulfonic and perfluorooctanoic acids proposed by epa in february 2020 and a provisional national pollutant discharge elimination strategy for permitting per and polyfluoroalkyl substances proposed by epa in november 2020 

in 2015 epa and the department of the army collectively the agencies adopted rules that added remote “tributaries” into the regulatory definition of “waters of the united states” that are protected by the clean water act thereby imposing significant additional restrictions on land uses in remote areas with only tenuous connections to active waterways these rules were challenged by multiple states and industry parties and litigation is ongoing on october 22 2019 the agencies published a final rule that repeals these 2015 rules and recodifies the regulations in place prior to adoption of the 2015 rules epa also published a proposed rule on february 14 2019 which revises the definition of “waters of the united states” to clarify the scope of waters federally regulated under the clean water act the final rule became effective on june 22 2020 and is currently subject to multiple legal challenges in connection with the presidential executive order issued on january 20 2021 the executive order this final rule will be reviewed again by the agencies these rules define whether we need federal authorization under the clean water act to expand our operations 

regulations have been considered at various governmental levels to increase financial responsibility requirements both for mine closure and reclamation and for oil and gas decommissioning in 2019 legislation was enacted in colorado that eliminates our ability to use parent company guarantees and requires proof of an end date for water treatment as a condition of permit issuance authorizing mining operations with some exceptions for existing operations adoption of similar environmental regulations or more stringent application of existing regulations may materially increase our costs threaten certain operating activities and constrain our expansion opportunities in 2018 epa concluded a rulemaking that considered the need for financial responsibility for hardrock mining operations under cercla by publishing its determination that it did not intend to require financial responsibility for the hardrock mining industry sector in connection with the executive order epa will review this final action 

our mining operations are subject to regulations under the endangered species act esa that are intended to protect species listed by the department of interior’s fish  wildlife service fws as endangered or threatened along with critical habitat designated by fws for these listed species the regulations limit the ability of landowners including us to obtain federal permits or authorizations needed for expansion of our operations and may also affect our ability to obtain retain or deliver water to some operations on august 27 2019 fws published final rules that mitigate but do not eliminate potential regulatory constraints on mining operations under the esa and on december 16 2020 fws published revisions to its definition of critical habitat on december 18 2020 fws published a final rule governing exclusion of areas from critical habitat based on a discretionary exclusion analysis in connection with the executive order these rules will be reviewed again by fws fws is also reconsidering the listing of certain species and designation of critical habitat for several listed species no assurances can be made that restrictions relating to conservation will not have an adverse impact on expansion of our operations or not result in delays in project development constraints on exploration and constraints on operations in impacted areas 

we incurred environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs including our joint venture partners’ shares to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect our operations totaling 03 billion in 2020 and 04 billion in both 2019 and 2018 for 2021 we expect to incur approximately 04 billion of aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs the timing and amounts of estimated payments 

could change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements changes in scope and costs of reclamation and plug and abandonment activities the settlement of environmental matters and the rate at which actual spending occurs on continuing matters 

we incur significant costs for remediating environmental conditions on properties that have not been operated in many years 

fmc and its subsidiaries and many of their affiliates and predecessor companies have been involved in exploration mining milling smelting and manufacturing in the us for more than a century activities that occurred in the late 19th century and the 20th century prior to the advent of modern environmental laws were not subject to environmental regulation and were conducted before american industrial companies fully understood the longterm effects of their operations on the surrounding environment 

with the passage of cercla in 1980 companies like fmc became legally responsible for remediating hazardous substances released into the environment from properties owned or operated by them as well as properties where they arranged for disposal of such substances irrespective of when the release to the environment occurred or who caused it that liability is often asserted on a joint and several basis with other prior and subsequent owners operators and arrangers meaning that each owner or operator of the property is and each arranger may be held fully responsible for the remediation although in many cases some or all of the other responsible parties no longer exist do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found as a result because of our acquisition of fmc in 2007 many of the subsidiary companies we now own are potentially responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the us and we expect to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those remediation issues we are also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources at december 31 2020 we had more than 100 active remediation projects in 24 us states in addition fmc and certain affiliates and predecessor companies were parties to agreements relating to the transfer of businesses or properties that contained indemnification provisions relating to environmental matters and from time to time these provisions become the source of claims against us 

at december 31 2020 we had 16 billion recorded in our consolidated balance sheet for environmental obligations attributable to cercla or analogous state programs and for estimated future costs associated with environmental matters at closed facilities or closed portions of operating facilities 

our environmental obligation estimates are primarily based upon 

• our knowledge and beliefs about complex scientific and historical facts and circumstances that in many cases occurred many decades ago 

• our beliefs and assumptions regarding the nature extent and duration of remediation activities that we will be required to undertake and the estimated costs of those remediation activities which are subject to varying interpretations and 

• our beliefs regarding the requirements that are imposed on us by existing laws and regulations and in some cases the clarification of uncertain regulatory requirements that could materially affect our environmental obligation estimates 

significant adjustments to these estimates are likely to occur in the future as additional information becomes available the actual environmental costs may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs and any such changes could be material 

in addition remediation standards imposed by epa and state environmental agencies have generally become more stringent over time and may become even more stringent in the future imposition of more stringent remediation standards particularly for arsenic and lead in soils poses a risk that additional remediation work could be required at our active remediation sites and at sites that we have already remediated to the satisfaction of the responsible governmental agencies and may increase the risk of toxic tort litigation 

epa is considering how to reduce lead exposure in the environment under multiple environmental programs certain federal and state health agencies also support lower lead cleanup levels the timing for these epa activities is unclear but reduction in lead cleanup levels could result in material increases to our environmental reserves for ongoing residential property cleanup projects near former smelter sites 

refer to note 12 for further discussion of our environmental obligations 

our indonesia mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges and future changes in environmental laws or unanticipated environmental impacts from those operations could require us to incur increased costs 

mining operations on the scale of our indonesia operations involve significant environmental risks and challenges our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of crushed and ground rock material called tailings that results from the process by which we physically separate the copper gold and silverbearing materials from the ore that we mine in 2020 ptfi produced approximately 30 million metric tons of tailings our tailings management plan which has been approved by the indonesia government uses the unnavigable river system in the highlands near our mine to transport the tailings to an engineered area in the lowlands where the tailings and natural sediments are managed in a deposition area lateral levees have been constructed to help contain the footprint of the tailings and to limit their impact in the lowlands 

another major environmental challenge is managing overburden which is the rock that must be moved aside in the mining process to reach the ore in the presence of air water and naturally occurring bacteria some overburden can generate acid rock drainage or acidic water containing dissolved metals that if not properly managed can adversely affect the environment in addition certain overburden stockpiles are subject to erosion caused by the large amounts of rainfall with the eroded stockpile material eventually being deposited in the lowlands tailings management area certain of the grasberg overburden stockpiles have experienced significant erosion over time exacerbated in 2011 by unanticipated work stoppages that adversely affected our ability to properly manage these overburden stockpiles this overburden affects the volume as well as the physical and chemical characteristics of the sediment material deposited in the lowlands tailings management area resulting in increased environmental impacts ptfi’s current tailings deposition management plan as well as environmental monitoring programs take into account the presence of this overburden in the lowlands tailings management area as part of its management and monitoring program ptfi expanded the scope of its studies and analysis to assess the environmental and potential human health impacts resulting from the overburden erosion including conducting and updating risk assessments to determine what additional monitoring and mitigation efforts such impacts may require in the future which will result in increased costs that could be significant 

in the past certain indonesia government officials have raised questions with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans including a suggestion that we implement a pipeline system rather than the river transport system for tailings management and disposition because our indonesia mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area a pipeline system would be costly difficult to construct and maintain and more prone to catastrophic failure and could therefore involve significant potentially adverse environmental issues based on our own studies and others conducted by third parties we do not believe that a pipeline system is necessary or practical 

we cannot guarantee that we will not have overtopping or levee failure caused by extreme weather events or unanticipated structural failure in the future which could result in flooding of the nearby communities if flooding were to occur it could result in loss of lives and severe personal property and environmental damages which could necessitate evacuation or relocation of communities or other emergency action financial assistance to the communities impacted and remediation costs to repair and compensate for the social cultural and economic impacts 

in december 2018 indonesia’s ministry of environment and forestry moef issued a revised environmental permit to ptfi to address many of the operational activities that it alleged were inconsistent with earlier studies ptfi and the moef also established a new framework for continuous improvement in environmental practices in ptfi’s operations including initiatives that ptfi will pursue to increase tailings retention and to evaluate large scale beneficial uses of tailings within indonesia in addition ptfi continues to work with moef to finalize environmental permitting related to the rail facilities and certain of the underground mining production operations as well as permitting for the extension of levees to contain the lateral flow of tailings in the lowlands refer to note 12 for further discussion 

we cannot assure you that future environmental changes affecting the mining industry in indonesia will not be introduced or unexpectedly altered or repealed or that new interpretations of existing environmental laws and regulations will not be issued which might have a significant impact on ptfi 

our operations require significant energy and regulation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions may increase our costs and adversely   affect our operations 

our operations require significant energy much of which is from fossil fuel sources and is obtained from third parties under longterm contracts energy represented approximately 16 percent of our copper mine site operating costs in 2020 and is expected to approximate 18 percent in 2021 the principal sources of energy consumption at our mining operations are diesel fuel which powers mine trucks and other transportation equipment purchased electricity which powers core facilities and certain onsite metal processing operations and coal and natural gas which provides electricity at certain operations 

in certain aspects of our operations our ability to reduce our ghg emissions is directly dependent on the actions of third parties and our ability to make significant rapid changes in our ghg emissions in response to potential future regulations may be limited for example ghg emissions from our dieselfueled mine trucks make up the majority of our scope 1 ghg emissions at our north america and south america operations but reduction of emissions from mine trucks will depend upon the development of alternativefueled mining equipment by our thirdparty suppliers in addition while we strive to purchase renewable power for our mining operations as a commercial consumer of power our ability to reduce our scope 2 ghg emissions associated with our power demand is dependent upon the mix of our suppliers and locallyavailable renewable energy resources as a result we could face additional costs associated with any new regulation of ghg emissions and our ability to modify our operations to avoid these costs may be limited in the near term 

as a result of the paris agreement reached during the 21 st conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change in 2015 a number of governments have pledged “nationally determined contributions” to control and reduce ghg emissions under the new presidential administration the us rejoined the paris agreement in january 2021 which may result in a renewed focus on policies to reduce ghg emissions at the federal level in the us several states including colorado and new mexico have advanced goals reducing or eliminating fossilfuel based energy production transitions to renewable and other energy sources could among other things increase our operating and energy costs depending on the scope magnitude and timing of increased regulation of fossilfuel based energy production including ghg emissions 

the physical impacts of climate change may adversely affect our copper mining operations 

the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would vary by operation based on particular geographic circumstances at many of our copper mine sites climate change is projected to impact local precipitation regimes resulting in shorterduration higherintensity storm events and the potential for less precipitation overall we could face increased operational costs associated with managing additional volumes of storm water during more intense future events in addition the potential for overall decreases in precipitation could affect the availability of water needed for our operations leading to increased operating costs or in extreme cases disruptions to mining operations 

as part of our commitment to implementing the tailings standard we will be required to consider uncertainties due to climate change incorporate that assessment into the relevant knowledge base for our tailings facilities use this knowledge base to enhance the resilience of our approach to the impacts of climate change using an adaptive management approach incorporate that knowledge into facility operations and take measures to mitigate both environmental impact and potential failure risks at our tailings facilities including those arising from climate change to the extent these obligations require future changes at our tailings facilities it could increase our operational expenses or require further capital investments 

increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from stakeholders with respect to our esg practices performance and disclosures may impact our reputation and business and impose additional costs on us 

there is increased scrutiny from stakeholders related to our esg practices performance and disclosures including prioritization of sustainable and responsible production practices decarbonization and reduction of our carbon footprint tailings stewardship and social license to operate among others in the jurisdictions where we operate we have adopted certain policies and programs as highlighted in our annual report on sustainability including with respect to responsible production frameworks climate change water stewardship biodiversity tailings management and stewardship waste management safety and health human capital management human rights social performance and community and indigenous people relations and responsible sourcing it is possible 

however that our stakeholders might not be satisfied with our esg practices performance andor disclosures or the speed of their adoption implementation and measurable success if we do not meet our evolving stakeholders’ expectations our reputation our access to and cost of capital and our stock price could be negatively impacted 

in addition our customers and end users may require that we implement certain additional esg procedures or standards before they will start or continue to do business with us which could lead to preferential buying based on our esg practices compared to our competitors’ esg practices 

investor advocacy groups certain institutional investors investment funds creditors and other influential investors are increasingly focused on our esg practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the implications of their investments organizations that provide information to investors on esg performance and related matters have developed quantitative and qualitative data collection processes and ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to esg matters such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions unfavorable ratings or assessment of our esg practices may lead to negative investor sentiment toward us which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and cost of capital additionally if we do not adapt to or comply with investor or stakeholder expectations and standards which are evolving or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so we may suffer from reputational damage and our business financial condition andor stock price could be materially and adversely affected 

failure or perceived failure to manage our relationships with the communities where we operate including communities that are adjacent to or near our operations and indigenous people could harm our reputation and social license to operate 

our relationships with the communities where we operate including communities that are adjacent to or near our operations and indigenous people are critical to the longterm success of our existing operations and the development of any future projects there is an ongoing and potentially increasing public concern relating to social license to operate and the perceived effect of mining activities on the environment and on communities impacted by such activities we may engage in activities such as exploration production construction or expansion of our operations that have or are perceived to have adverse impacts on the local communities and their relevant stakeholders society as a whole indigenous peoples cultural heritage human rights and the environment for example our operations may take place on or adjacent to indigenous peoples’ territories we may be required or expected by our stakeholders to consult with andor obtain consent from indigenous peoples with respect to these operations in addition our assets are generally longlived and perceptions and expectations from stakeholders can change over the life of the mine changes in the aspirations and expectations of local communities where we operate including indigenous peoples with respect to our contributions to employee health and safety infrastructure community development environmental management and other factors could affect our social license to operate and reputation and lead to increased costs and reduced future earnings if expansions or new projects are blocked either temporarily or for extended periods failure to effectively engage with communities on an ongoing basis including the withdrawal of consent or support of indigenous peoples or other stakeholders could adversely impact our business damage our reputation andor result in loss of rights to explore operate or develop our projects 

other risks 

our holding company structure may impact our ability to service debt and our stockholders ’ ability to receive dividends  

we are a holding company with no material assets other than the capital stock and intercompany receivables of our subsidiaries as a result our ability to repay our indebtedness and pay dividends is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend loan debt repayment or otherwise our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to make funds available to us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends dividends from subsidiaries that are not wholly owned are shared with other equity owners cash at our international operations is also typically subject to foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation into the us 

in addition our subsidiaries may not be able to or be permitted to make distributions to us or repay loans to us to enable us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal restrictions as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries certain of our subsidiaries are parties to 

credit agreements that restrict their ability to make distributions or loan repayments to us if such subsidiary is in default under such agreements or to transfer substantially all of the assets of such subsidiary without the consent of the lenders 

our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries’ assets upon their liquidation reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries’ creditors including any trade creditors 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult these provisions 

• authorize the board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and to designate the rights preferences and privileges of each class if issued such preferred stock would increase the number of outstanding shares of our capital stock and could include terms that may deter an acquisition of us 

• establish advance notice requirements for nominations to the board or for proposals that can be presented at stockholder meetings 

• limit who may call stockholder meetings and establish information requirements and timing restrictions for meeting requests 

• require the approval of the holders of two thirds of our outstanding common stock to enter into certain business combination transactions subject to certain exceptions including if the consideration to be received by our common stockholders in the transaction is deemed to be a fair price and 

• provide to the fullest extent permitted by law that unless fcx consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware or if the court of chancery does not have or declines to accept jurisdiction the united states district court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any i derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of fcx ii action asserting a claim that is based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director officer employee or stockholder of fcx in such capacity iii action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law or to which the delaware general corporation law confers jurisdiction upon the court of chancery of the state of delaware iv action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine or v action asserting an “internal corporate claim” as that term is defined in section 115 of the delaware general corporation law 

these provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by the board 

the choice of forum provision may increase costs to bring a claim discourage claims or limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with fcx or its directors officers or other employees which may discourage such lawsuits against fcx or its directors officers and other employees alternatively if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in fcx’s bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action fcx may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions the exclusive forum provision in fcx’s bylaws will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under the federal securities laws including the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the securities act of 1933 as amended or the respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder 

in addition because we are incorporated in delaware we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with or acquisition of us 

these provisions may deter an acquisition of us that might otherwise be attractive to our stockholders

below is a discussion of our material pending legal proceedings not otherwise required to be disclosed in our notes to consolidated financial statements refer to note 12 for a discussion of other material pending legal proceedings 

in addition to the material pending legal proceedings discussed below and in note 12 we are involved periodically in ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business and not required to be disclosed some of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief 

united states us securities and exchange commission sec regulations require us to disclose environmental proceedings involving a governmental authority if we reasonably believe that such proceedings may result in monetary sanctions above a stated threshold pursuant to the sec regulations we use a threshold of 1 million for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such environmental proceedings is required 

management does not believe based on currently available information that the outcome of any currently pending legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition although individual or cumulative outcomes could be material to our operating results for a particular period depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period 

water rights adjudications 

our operations in the western us require significant secure quantities of water for mining and ore processing activities and related support facilities continuous operation of our mines is dependent on among other things our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies in the arid western us where certain of our mines are located water rights are often contested and disputes over water rights are generally timeconsuming expensive and not necessarily dispositive unless they resolve both actual and potential claims the loss of a water right or a currently available water supply could force us to curtail operations or force premature closures thereby increasing andor accelerating costs or foregoing profitable operations 

at our north america operations certain of our water supplies are supported by surface water rights which give us the right to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location in arizona where our operations use both surface and groundwater we are a participant in an active adjudication in which arizona courts have been attempting for over 45 years to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for the gila river system one of the state’s largest river systems this gila river adjudication primarily affects our morenci safford and sierrita mines the gila river adjudication is addressing the state law claims of thousands of competing users including us as well as significant federal water claims that are potentially adverse to the state law claims of both surface water and groundwater users groundwater is treated differently from surface water under arizona law which historically allowed land owners to pump unlimited quantities of subsurface water subject only to the requirement of putting it to “reasonable use” however court decisions in the adjudication have concluded that some subsurface water constitutes “subflow” that is to be treated legally as surface water and is therefore subject to the arizona doctrine of prior appropriation and to the adjudication and potentially unavailable to groundwater pumpers including us in the absence of valid surface water claims any recharacterization of groundwater as surface water could affect the ability of consumers farmers ranchers municipalities and industrial users like us to continue to access water supplies that have been relied on for decades because we are a user of both groundwater and surface water in arizona we are an active participant in the gila river adjudication 

in re the general adjudication of all rights to use water in the gila river system and sources  maricopa county superior court cause nos w1 salt w2 verde w3 upper gila and w4 san pedro this case was originally initiated in 1974 with the filing of a petition with the arizona state land department and was consolidated and transferred to the maricopa county superior court in 1981 the principal parties in addition to us include arizona public service company asarco llc bhp copper inc the state of arizona various cities and towns and water companies the gila valley irrigation district the franklin irrigation district the san carlos irrigation and drainage district the salt river project the san carlos apache tribe the gila river indian community and the us on behalf of those tribes on its own behalf and on behalf of the white mountain apache tribe the fort 

mcdowell mohaveapache indian community the salt river pimamaricopa indian community and the payson community of yavapai apache indians prior to january 1 1983 various indian tribes filed separate suits in the us district court in arizona claiming superior rights to water being used by many other parties including us and claiming damages for prior use in derogation of their allegedly superior rights these federal proceedings have been stayed in favor of the adjudications pending in arizona state courts and some of the federal suits have since been settled 

in 2005 the maricopa county superior court directed the arizona department of water resources adwr to prepare detailed recommendations regarding the delineation of the “subflow” zone of the san pedro river a tributary of the gila river subsurface water within the subflow zone is presumed to constitute appropriable subflow rather than groundwater although we have minimal interests in the san pedro river basin a decision that recharacterizes groundwater in that basin as appropriable subflow may set a precedent for other river systems in arizona that could have material implications for many commercial industrial municipal and agricultural users of groundwater including our arizona operations in 2017 the court approved adwr’s proposed subflow zone maps water pumped from wells located inside the mapped subflow zone is now presumed to be appropriable subflow no party has appealed that decision 

in 2014 adwr submitted a proposal for the development of procedures for “cone of depression” analyses to determine whether a well located outside of the subflow zone creates a cone of depression that intersects the subflow zone based on these cone of depression analyses wells outside of the subflow zone could be subject to the adjudications pending in arizona state courts in the absence of a valid surface water claim to support the pumping owners of wells deemed to be depleting the subflow zone through their cones of depression may be subject to claims that they must refrain from pumping subflow or must pay damages in january 2017 adwr issued a report containing its recommended cone of depression test and a trial was held in march 2018 concerning adwr’s recommended action 

on november 14 2018 the special master for the gila river adjudication issued a final decision rejecting adwr’s recommended cone of depression test instead adopting our position that a numeric model capable of accounting for complexities of the aquifer system should be used the special master also confirmed that the cone of depression test instead would be an initial test for determining which wells are subject to the adjudications rather than proving that a well is pumping subflow or establishing how much of a well’s water production is subflow such matters will be determined by a subsequent “subflow depletion test” which has not yet been formulated some of our adversaries objected to the special master’s final decision and the arizona superior court heard oral argument on the objections in february 2020 this issue remains under advisement with the arizona superior court 

in response to the special master’s decision in december 2018 adwr submitted its initial report on the “subflow depletion test” which will specify the methodology a well owner must use to quantify the portion of the water drawn from a well that is subflow as opposed to groundwater however adwr remains in the process of developing its proposed subflow depletion test we along with the other parties will have the opportunity to provide input throughout the process the first issue being litigated concerning the subflow depletion test is scheduled for trial in february 2021 and we are among the active litigants 

in june 2020 the special master designated legal questions to be resolved concerning a well owner’s ability to obtain a surface water right for subsurface water that is ultimately determined to be appropriable subflow the parties will be briefing these issues in january and february 2021 and the special master has scheduled a trial for april 2021 

as part of the adjudications the us has asserted numerous claims for express and implied “reserved” surface water and groundwater rights on indian and nonindian federal lands throughout arizona these claims are related to reservations of federal land for specific purposes  eg  indian reservations national parks military bases and wilderness areas unlike state lawbased water rights federal reserved water rights are given priority in the “prior appropriation” system based on the date the land was reserved not the date that water was first used on the land in addition federal reserved water rights may enjoy greater protection from groundwater pumping than is accorded to state lawbased water rights 

in multiple instances the us asserts a right to all water in a particular watershed that was not effectively appropriated under state law prior to the establishment of the federal reservation this creates risks for both surface water users and groundwater users because such expansive claims may severely impede competing uses of water 

within the same watershed because there are numerous federal reservations in watersheds across arizona the reserved water right claims of the us pose a significant risk to multiple operations including morenci and safford in the upper gila river watershed and sierrita in the santa cruz watershed because federal reserved water rights may adversely affect water uses at each of these operations we have been actively involved in litigation over these claims because federal reserved water rights have not yet been quantified the task of determining how much water each federal reservation may use has been left to the arizona superior court handling the gila river adjudication several “contested cases” to quantify reserved water rights for particular federal reservations in arizona are currently pending with only one resolved at this time that case in re aravaipa canyon wilderness area was to resolve the us’s claims to water for the aravaipa canyon wilderness area the case was tried in 2015 and the court issued a decision in december 2018 supportive of our position on almost all issues including rejection of us’s core argument that wilderness areas are entitled to all water that was not appropriated at the time the reservation was created we believe the rulings in this case will support our positions in other pending federal reserved water right cases including these in re fort huachuca  which involves the us’s claims to water for an arizona army base and is awaiting a decision following a trial which concluded in february 2017 in re redfield canyon wilderness area  which involves the us’s claims to water for another wilderness area and is awaiting a decision following a trial which concluded in may 2017 and in re san pedro riparian national conservation area  which involves the us’s claims to water for a national conservation area and is awaiting a decision following a trial which concluded in may 2018 

given the legal and technical complexity of these adjudications their long history and their longterm legal economic and political implications it is difficult to predict the timing or the outcome of these proceedings if we are not able to satisfactorily resolve the issues being addressed in the adjudications our ability to pump groundwater could be diminished or curtailed and our operations at morenci safford and sierrita could be adversely affected unless we are able to acquire alternative resources

general 

we are a leading international mining company with headquarters in phoenix arizona our company was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware on november 10 1987 we operate large longlived geographically diverse assets with significant proven and probable reserves of copper gold and molybdenum and we are one of the world’s largest publicly traded copper producers our portfolio of assets includes the grasberg minerals district in indonesia one of the world’s largest copper and gold deposits and significant mining operations in north america and south america including the largescale morenci minerals district in arizona and the cerro verde operation in peru 

we believe that we have a highquality portfolio of longlived copper assets positioned to generate longterm value pt freeport indonesia ptfi continues to advance several projects in the grasberg minerals district related to the development of its largescale longlived highgrade underground ore bodies and we are nearing completion of a project to develop the lone star leachable ores near the safford operation in eastern arizona which is now approximately 75 percent complete we are also pursuing other opportunities to enhance our mines’ net present values and we continue to advance studies for future development of our copper resources the timing of which will be dependent on market conditions 

during 2019 we advanced initiatives in our north america and south america mining operations to enhance productivity expand margins and reduce the capital intensity of the business through the utilization of new technology applications in combination with a more interactive operating structure the pilot program initiated at the bagdad mine in northwest arizona in late 2018 was successful in utilizing data science machine learning and integrated functional teams to address bottlenecks provide cost benefits and drive improved overall performance the program is now being implemented across our north america and south america operations 

during fourthquarter 2019 ptfi completed mining the final phase of the grasberg open pit and continues to achieve important milestones in rampingup production of largescale quantities of copper and gold from its significant underground ore bodies in aggregate the grasberg open pit produced over 27 billion pounds of copper and 46 million ounces of gold in the 30year period from 1990 through 2019 as ptfi continues to rampup production from its underground ore bodies our consolidated metal production is expected to improve significantly by 2021 

following are our ownership interests at december 31 2019  in operating mines through our consolidated subsidiaries freeport minerals corporation fmc and ptfi 

 

at december 31 2019  our estimated consolidated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves totaled 1160 billion pounds of copper 296 million ounces of gold and 358 billion pounds of molybdenum following is a summary of our estimated consolidated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves at december 31 2019  by geographic location refer to “mining operations” for further discussion 



 

in north america we operate seven copper mines  morenci bagdad safford sierrita and miami in arizona and chino and tyrone in new mexico and two molybdenum mines  henderson and climax in colorado in addition to copper certain of our north america copper mines also produce molybdenum concentrate gold and silver in south america we operate two copper mines  cerro verde in peru and el abra in chile in addition to copper the cerro verde mine also produces molybdenum concentrate and silver in indonesia ptfi operates in the grasberg minerals district in addition to copper the grasberg minerals district also produces gold and silver 

following is a summary of the geographic locations of our consolidated copper gold and molybdenum production for the year 2019 refer to “mining operations” for further information 



 

the geographic locations of our operating mines are shown on the world map below 

copper gold and molybdenum 

following is a brief discussion of our primary natural resources – copper gold and molybdenum for further discussion of historical and current market prices of these commodities refer to mda and item 1a “risk factors” 

copper 

copper is an internationally traded commodity and its prices are determined by the major metals exchanges – the london metal exchange lme new york mercantile exchange nymex and shanghai futures exchange prices on these exchanges generally reflect the worldwide balance of copper supply and demand and can be volatile and cyclical during 2019  the lme copper settlement price averaged 272 per pound ranging from a low of 251 per pound to a high of 298 per pound and was 279 per pound at december 31 2019  

in general demand for copper reflects the rate of underlying world economic growth particularly in industrial production and construction according to wood mackenzie a widely followed independent metals market consultant copper’s enduse markets and their estimated shares of total consumption are construction 28 percent electrical applications 28 percent consumer products 21 percent transportation 12 percent and industrial machinery 11 percent we believe copper will continue to be essential in these basic uses as well as contribute significantly to new technologies for energy efficiencies to advance communications and to enhance public health examples of areas we believe will require additional copper in the future include i high efficiency motors which consume up to 75 percent more copper than a standard motor ii electric vehicles which consume up to four times the amount of copper in terms of weight compared to vehicles of similar size with an internal combustion engine and require copperintensive charging station infrastructure to refuel and iii renewable energy such as wind and solar which consume four to five times the amount of copper compared to traditional fossil fuel generated power 

gold 

gold is used for jewelry coinage and bullion as well as various industrial and electronic applications gold can be readily sold on numerous markets throughout the world benchmark prices are generally based on london bullion market association london quotations during 2019  the london pm gold price averaged 1393 per ounce ranging from a low of 1270 per ounce to a high of 1546 per ounce and was 1515 per ounce on december 30 2019 there was no london pm gold price quote on december 31 2019  

molybdenum 

molybdenum is a key alloying element in steel and the raw material for several chemicalgrade products used in catalysts lubrication smoke suppression corrosion inhibition and pigmentation molybdenum as a highpurity metal is also used in electronics such as flatpanel displays and in super alloys used in aerospace reference prices for molybdenum are available in several publications including metals week cru report and metal bulletin  during 2019  the weekly average price of molybdenum quoted by metals week averaged 1137 per pound ranging from a low of 855 per pound to a high of 1266 per pound and was 923 per pound at december 31 2019  

products and sales 

our consolidated revenues for 2019 primarily included sales of copper  79 percent  gold  11 percent  and molybdenum  8 percent  copper concentrate sales to pt smelting ptfi’s 25percentowned copper smelter and refinery in gresik indonesia totaled 13 percent of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2019  and 12 percent for both the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 which is the only customer that accounted for 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues during the three years ended december 31 2019  refer to note 16 for a summary of our consolidated revenues and operating income loss by business segment and geographic area 

copper products 

we are one of the world’s leading producers of copper concentrate cathode and continuous cast copper rod during 2019  56 percent of our mined copper was sold in concentrate 22 percent as cathode and 22 percent as rod from our north america operations the copper ore from our mines is generally processed either by smelting and refining or by solution extraction and electrowinning sxew as described below 

copper concentrate  we produce copper concentrate at six of our mines in which mined ore is crushed and treated to produce a copper concentrate with copper content of approximately 20 to 30 percent in north america copper concentrate is produced at the morenci bagdad sierrita and chino mines and a significant portion is shipped to our miami smelter in arizona for further processing copper concentrate is also produced at the cerro verde mine in peru and the grasberg minerals district in indonesia 

copper cathode  we produce copper cathode at our electrolytic refinery located in el paso texas and at nine of our mines 

sxew cathode is produced from the morenci bagdad safford sierrita miami chino and tyrone mines in north america and from the cerro verde and el abra mines in south america  for ore subject to the sxew process the ore is placed on stockpiles and copper is extracted from the ore by dissolving it with a weak sulphuric acid solution the copper content of the solution is increased in two additional sx stages and then the copperbearing solution undergoes an ew process to produce cathode that is on average 9999 percent copper our copper cathode is used as the raw material input for copper rod brass mill products and for other uses 

copper cathode is also produced at atlantic copper our wholly owned copper smelting and refining unit in spain and pt smelting copper concentrate is smelted  ie  subjected to extreme heat to produce copper anode which weighs between 800 and 900 pounds and has an average copper content of 995 percent the anode is further treated by electrolytic refining to produce copper cathode which weighs between 100 and 350 pounds and has an average copper content of 9999 percent refer to “mining operations  smelting facilities and other mining properties” for further discussion of atlantic copper and pt smelting 

continuous cast copper rod  we manufacture continuous cast copper rod at our facilities in el paso texas norwich connecticut and miami arizona primarily using copper cathode produced at our north america copper mines 

copper sales 

north america  the majority of the copper produced at our north america copper mines and refined in our el paso texas refinery is consumed at our rod plants to produce copper rod which is sold to wire and cable manufacturers the remainder of our north america copper production is sold in the form of copper cathode or copper concentrate under us dollardenominated annual contracts cathode and rod contract prices are generally based on the prevailing commodity exchange inc comex  a division of nymex monthly average settlement price for the month of shipment and include a premium generally copper cathode is sold to rod brass or tube fabricators during 2019  23 percent of our north america mines’ copper concentrate sales volumes were shipped to atlantic copper for smelting and refining and sold as copper anode and copper cathode 

south america    production from our south america mines is sold as copper concentrate or copper cathode under us dollardenominated annual and multiyear contracts during 2019  our south america mines sold approximately 77 percent of their copper production in concentrate and 23 percent as cathode

the grasberg block cave ore body is the same ore body historically mined from the surface in the grasberg open pit undercutting drawbell construction and ore extraction activities in the grasberg block cave underground mine continue to track expectations monitoring data on cave propagation in the grasberg block cave underground mine is providing confidence in growing production rates over time as existing drawpoints mature and additional drawpoints are added cave expansion is expected to accelerate production rates to an average of 30000 metric tons of ore per day in 2020 over 60000 metric tons of ore per day in 2021 and 130000 metric tons of ore per day in 2023 from five production blocks spanning 335000 square meters 

ore milled from the grasberg block cave underground mine averaged 8600 metric tons per day in 2019 4000 metric tons per day in 2018 and 3600 metric tons per day in 2017 production at the grasberg block cave underground mine is expected to continue through 2041 

the grasberg block cave fleet consists of approximately 460 pieces of mobile equipment the primary mining equipment directly associated with production and development includes an available fleet of 52 lhd units and 35 haul trucks each production lhd unit typically carries approximately 11 metric tons of ore and transfer ore into 55 to 60 metric ton capacity haul trucks in addition the grasberg block cave has a rail haulage system currently operating with 3 locomotives and 27 ore wagons that haul the ore to the first of the 3 planned gyratory crushers located underground via an automated rail system each ore wagon typically carries 30 metric tons 

dmlz underground mine 

the dmlz ore body lies below the doz underground mine at the 2590meter elevation and represents the downward continuation of mineralization in the ertsberg east skarn system and neighboring ertsberg porphyry 

the dmlz has continued its rampup of production hydraulic fracturing operations have been effective in managing rock stresses and preconditioning the cave following mininginduced seismic activity experienced in 2017 and 2018 ore extraction continues to exceed expectations averaging 14900 metric tons of ore per day in fourthquarter 2019 and reached approximately 16000 metric tons of ore per day at yearend 2019 ongoing hydraulic fracturing operations combined with continued undercutting and drawbell openings in the two currently active production blocks are expected to expand the cave supporting higher production rates that are expected to average 29000 metric tons of ore per day in 2020 approach 60000 metric tons of ore per day in 2021 and 80000 metric tons of ore per day in 2022 from three production blocks 

ore milled from the dmlz underground mine averaged 9800 metric tons of ore per day in 2019  and 3200 metric tons per day in both 2018 and 2017 production at the dmlz underground mine is expected to continue through 2041 

the dmlz fleet consists of over 290 pieces of mobile equipment which includes 22 lhd units and 9 haul trucks used in production and development activities 

big gossan underground mine 

the big gossan ore body lies underground and adjacent to the current mill site it is a tabular near vertical ore body with approximate dimensions of 1200 meters along strike and 800 meters down dip with varying thicknesses from 20 meters to 120 meters the mine utilizes a blasthole stoping method with delayed paste backfill stopes of varying sizes are mined and the ore dropped down passes to a truck haulage level trucks are chute loaded and transport the ore to a jaw crusher the crushed ore is then hoisted vertically via a twoskip production shaft to a level where it is loaded onto a conveyor belt the belt carries the ore to one of the main underground conveyors where the ore is transferred and conveyed to the surface stockpiles for processing 

ore milled from the big gossan underground mine averaged 6100 metric tons per day in 2019 3800 metric tons per day in 2018 and 600 metric tons per day in 2017 production at the big gossan underground mine is expected to continue through 2041 

the big gossan fleet consists of over 88 pieces of mobile equipment which includes 12 lhd units and 9 haul trucks used in development and production activities 

doz underground mine 

the doz ore body lies vertically below the now depleted intermediate ore zone ptfi began production from the doz ore body in 1989 using openstope mining methods but suspended production in 1991 in favor of production from the grasberg open pit production resumed in 2000 using the blockcave method and is at the 3110meter elevation level 

the doz is a mature blockcave mine that previously operated at 80000 metric tons of ore per day current operating rates from the doz underground mine are driven by the value of the incremental doz ore grade compared to the ore from the dmlz and grasberg block cave underground mines ore milled from the doz underground mine averaged 25500 metric tons per day in 2019 33800 metric tons per day in 2018 and 31200 metric tons per day in 2017 production at the doz underground mine is expected to continue through 2022 

the doz fleet consists of 186 pieces of mobile equipment the primary mining equipment directly associated with production includes an available fleet of 40 lhd units and 19 haul trucks the trucks dump into two gyratory crushers and the ore is then conveyed to the surface stockpiles for processing 

description of indonesia ore bodies  our indonesia ore bodies are located within and around two main igneous intrusions the grasberg monzodiorite and the ertsberg diorite the host rocks of these ore bodies include both carbonate and clastic rocks that form the ridge crests and upper flanks of the sudirman range and the igneous rocks of monzonitic to dioritic composition that intrude them the igneoushosted ore bodies the grasberg block cave and portions of the doz occur as vein stockworks and disseminations of copper sulfides dominated by chalcopyrite and to a lesser extent bornite the sedimentaryrock hosted ore bodies portions of the doz and all of the big gossan occur as “magnetiterich calciummagnesian skarn” replacements whose location and orientation are strongly influenced by major faults and by the chemistry of the carbonate rocks along the margins of the intrusions 

the copper mineralization in these skarn deposits is dominated by chalcopyrite but higher bornite concentrations are common moreover gold occurs in significant concentrations in all of the district’s ore bodies though rarely visible to the naked eye these gold concentrations usually occur as inclusions within the copper sulfide minerals though in some deposits these concentrations can also be strongly associated with pyrite 

the following diagram indicates the relative elevations in meters of our reported indonesia ore bodies 

the following map which encompasses an area of 42 square kilometers 16 square miles indicates the relative positions and sizes of our reported indonesia ore bodies and their locations 

smelting facilities and other mining properties 

atlantic copper  our wholly owned atlantic copper smelter and refinery is located on land concessions from the huelva spain port authorities which are scheduled to expire in 2039 

the design capacity of the smelter is approximately 300000 metric tons of copper per year and the refinery has a capacity of 286000 metric tons of copper per year atlantic copper produced 272000 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 268300 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2019  295300 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 283100 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2018 and 283100 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 271400 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2017 

following is a summary of atlantic copper’s concentrate purchases from unaffiliated third parties and our copper mining operations for the years ended december 31 



atlantic copper’s major maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately every eight years with shorterterm maintenance turnarounds in the interim atlantic copper completed a 79day major maintenance turnaround in 2013 a 16day maintenance turnaround in 2015 a 27day maintenance turnaround in 2017 and a 16day maintenance turnaround in 2019 the next major maintenance turnaround is scheduled for 2021 

pt smelting  ptfi’s former cow required us to construct or cause to be constructed a smelter in indonesia if we and the indonesia government determined that such a project would be economically viable in 1995 following the completion of a feasibility study we entered into agreements relating to the formation of pt smelting an indonesia company and the construction of the copper smelter and refinery in gresik indonesia pt smelting owns and operates the smelter and refinery ptfi owns 25 percent of pt smelting with the remainder owned by mitsubishi 

materials corporation 605 percent mitsubishi corporation rtm japan ltd 95 percent and jx nippon mining  metals corporation 5 percent 

ptfi’s contract with pt smelting requires ptfi to supply 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements at market rates subject to a minimum or maximum treatment charge rate necessary for pt smelting to produce 205000 metric tons of copper annually on a priority basis ptfi may also sell copper concentrate to pt smelting at market rates for quantities in excess of 205000 metric tons of copper annually ptfi supplied 90 percent of pt smelting’s concentrate requirements in both 2019 and 2018 and 93 percent in 2017 

in early 2017 the indonesia government issued new regulations to address exports of unrefined metals including copper concentrate and anode slimes and other matters related to the mining sector these regulations permit the export of anode slimes which is necessary for pt smelting to continue operating as a result of labor disturbances and a delay in the renewal of its export license for anode slimes pt smelting’s operations were shut down from midjanuary 2017 until early march 2017 in march 2019 pt smelting received a oneyear extension of its anode slimes export license which currently expires march 11 2020 refer to item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

pt smelting produced 246100 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 241200 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2019  258800 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 257600 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2018 and 245800 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 247800 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2017 

pt smelting’s maintenance turnarounds which range from two weeks to a month to complete typically are expected to occur approximately every two years with shortterm maintenance turnarounds in the interim pt smelting completed a 30day maintenance turnaround during 2018 and the next major turnaround is scheduled to start in november 2020 

miami smelter  we own and operate a smelter at our miami mining operation in arizona the smelter has been operating for over 100 years and has been upgraded numerous times during that period to implement new technologies improve production and comply with air quality requirements in 2018 the miami smelter completed the installation of emission control equipment that allows it to operate in compliance with current air quality standards refer to item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

the miami smelter processes copper concentrate primarily from our north america copper mines concentrate processed through the smelter totaled 641000 metric tons in 2019  729900 metric tons in 2018 and 612600 metric tons in 2017 in addition because sulphuric acid is a byproduct of smelting concentrate the miami smelter is also the most significant source of sulphuric acid for our north america leaching operations 

major maintenance turnarounds which take approximately three weeks to complete are anticipated to occur approximately every two years for the miami smelter the miami smelter completed a major maintenance turnaround in the first half of 2019 and the next major maintenance turnaround is scheduled for 2021   

rod  refining operations  our rod  refining operations consist of conversion facilities located in north america including a refinery in el paso texas rod mills in el paso texas norwich connecticut and miami arizona and a specialty copper products facility in bayway new jersey we refine our copper anode production from our miami smelter at our el paso refinery the el paso refinery has the potential to operate at an annual production capacity of about 900 million pounds of copper cathode which is sufficient to refine all of the copper anode we produce at our miami smelter our el paso refinery also produces nickel carbonate copper telluride and autoclaved slimes material containing gold silver platinum and palladium 

molybdenum conversion facilities  we process molybdenum concentrate at our conversion plants in the us and europe into such products as technicalgrade molybdic oxide ferromolybdenum pure molybdic oxide ammonium molybdates and molybdenum disulfide we operate molybdenum roasters in sierrita arizona fort madison iowa and rotterdam the netherlands and we operate a molybdenum pressureleach plant in bagdad arizona we also produce ferromolybdenum for customers worldwide at our conversion plant located in stowmarket united kingdom 

freeport cobalt  in march 2013 we acquired a cobalt chemical refinery in kokkola finland and the related sales and marketing business which provided direct endmarket access for the cobalt hydroxide production at the tenke fungurume mine in the democratic republic of congo in which we held an interest prior to our sale of tf holdings limited in 2016 we as operator held an effective 56 percent ownership interest the remaining effective ownership interest was held by lundin mining corporation 24 percent and la générale des carrières et des mines 20 percent the kokkola refinery has an annual refining capacity of approximately 15000 metric tons of cobalt 

in fourthquarter 2019 we completed the sale of the cobalt refinery and related cobalt cathode precursor business to umicore under the terms of the agreement we separated the cobalt business and umicore acquired the refinery and cathode precursor business which represents approximately 60 percent of the refinery’s historical revenues we and the current noncontrolling interest partners in freeport cobalt will retain the remaining cobalt business which is a producer of cobalt fine powders chemicals catalysts ceramics and pigments 

refer to note 2 for additional discussion of the disposition 

other north america copper mines  we also have five nonoperating copper mines – ajo bisbee tohono twin buttes and christmas which are located in arizona – that have been on careandmaintenance status for several years and would require new or updated environmental studies new permits and additional capital investment which could be significant to return them to operating status 

mining development projects and exploration activities 

capital expenditures for mining operations totaled 265 billion including 15 billion for major projects in 2019  20 billion including 12 billion for major projects in 2018 and 14 billion including 09 billion for major projects in 2017  capital expenditures for major projects during 2019 and 2018 were primarily associated with underground development activities in the grasberg minerals district and development of the lone star copper leach project capital expenditures for major projects during 2017 were primarily associated with the cerro verde expansion project and underground development activities in the grasberg minerals district refer to mda for projected capital expenditures for the year 2020 

we have several projects and potential opportunities to expand production volumes extend mine lives and develop largescale underground ore bodies as further discussed in mda our nearterm major development projects primarily include the underground development activities in the grasberg minerals district and development of the lone star copper leach project which is nearing completion considering the longterm nature and large size of our development projects actual costs and timing could vary from estimates additionally in response to market conditions the timing of our expenditures will continue to be reviewed we continue to review our mine development and processing plans to maximize the value of our mineral reserves 

ptfi has also committed to construct a new smelter in indonesia by december 21 2023 refer to mda for a discussion of the smelter project 

we also have an additional longterm underground mine development project in the grasberg minerals district for the kucing liar ore body which lies on the southern flank of and underneath the southern portion of the grasberg open pit at the 2605meter elevation level we expect to mine the kucing liar ore body using the blockcave method aggregate longterm capital cost estimates for development of the kucing liar ore body are projected to approximate 36 billion and the timing of development is under review additionally full development would require 57 billion of capital expenditures at our processing facilities to optimize the handling of underground ore types the timing of this project and tradeoff studies are currently being reviewed 

our mining exploration activities are generally associated with our existing mines focusing on opportunities to expand reserves and resources to support development of additional future production capacity exploration results continue to indicate opportunities for significant future potential reserve additions in north america and south america exploration spending associated with mining operations totaled 77 million in 2019  78 million in 2018 and 72 million in 2017  refer to mda for projected exploration expenditures for the year 2020  

refer to item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion of risks associated with mine development projects and exploration activities and ptfi’s iupk 

sources and availability of energy natural resources and raw materials 

our copper mining operations require significant amounts of energy principally diesel electricity coal and natural gas most of which is obtained from third parties under longterm contracts energy represented approximately 20 percent of our copper mine site operating costs in 2019  including purchases of approximately 230 million gallons of diesel fuel 8200 gigawatt hours of electricity at our north america and south america copper mining operations we generate all of our power at our indonesia mining operation 675 thousand metric tons of coal for our coal power plant in indonesia and 1 million mmbtu million british thermal units of natural gas at certain of our north america mines based on current cost estimates energy will approximate 20 percent of our copper mine site operating costs in 2020  

our mining operations also require significant quantities of water for mining ore processing and related support facilities the loss of water rights for any of our mines in whole or in part or shortages of water to which we have rights could require us to curtail or shut down mining operations for a further discussion of risks and legal proceedings associated with the availability of water refer to item 1a “risk factors” and item 3 “legal proceedings” 

sulphuric acid is used in the sxew process and is produced as a byproduct of the smelting process at our smelters and from our sulfur burners at the safford mine sulphuric acid needs in excess of the sulphuric acid produced by our operations are purchased from third parties 

community and human rights 

we have adopted policies that govern our working relationships with the communities where we operate and that are designed to guide our practices and programs in a manner that respects human rights and the culture of the local people impacted by our operations we continue to make significant expenditures on community development health education training and cultural programs which include 

 

in december 2000 we endorsed the joint us state departmentbritish foreign office voluntary principles on human rights and security voluntary principles we participated in developing these voluntary principles with other major natural resource companies and international human rights organizations and they are incorporated into our human rights policy the voluntary principles provide guidelines for our security programs including interaction with hostgovernment security personnel private security contractors and our internal security employees 

our human rights policy most recently updated in august 2017 reflects our full commitment to the united nations guiding principles on business and human rights we have embarked on a program to plan and conduct sitelevel human rights impact assessments hria at our global operations 

hrias help us to embed human rights considerations into our business practices including sitelevel sustainable development risk registers we completed a hria at our cerro verde operation in peru in 2017 and at our new mexico mining operations in 2018 we also participate in a multiindustry human rights working group to gain insight from peer companies 

we believe that our social and economic development programs are responsive to the issues raised by the local communities near our areas of operation and help us maintain good relations with the surrounding communities and avoid disruptions of mining operations as part of our ongoing commitment to sustainable community development we have made and expect to continue making investments in certain social programs including inkind support and administration across our global operations from time to time over the last three years these investments have averaged 136 million per year nevertheless social and political instability in the areas of our operations may adversely impact our mining operations refer to item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

south america  cerro verde has provided a variety of community support projects over the years following engagements with regional and local governments civic leaders and development agencies in 2006 cerro verde committed to support the costs for a new potable water treatment plant to serve arequipa in addition an agreement was reached with the peru government for development of a water storage network that was financed by cerro verde and a distribution network that was financed by the cerro verde civil association 

cerro verde reached an agreement with the regional government of arequipa the national government the local water utility company and other local institutions to allow it to finance engineer and construct a wastewater treatment plant for the city of arequipa which was completed in 2015 the wastewater treatment plant supplements existing water supplies to support cerro verde’s concentrator expansion and also improves the local water quality enhances agriculture products grown in the area and reduces the risk of waterborne illnesses in addition to these projects cerro verde annually makes significant community development investments in the arequipa region 

security matters  consistent with our operating permits in peru and our commitment to protect our employees and property we have taken steps to provide a safe and secure working environment as part of its security program cerro verde maintains its own internal security department both employees and contractors perform functions such as protecting company facilities monitoring shipments of supplies and products assisting in traffic control and aiding in emergency response operations the security department receives human rights and voluntary principles training annually some contractors assigned to protection of expatriate personnel are armed these contractors also receive training in defensive driving and firearms handling cerro verde’s costs for its internal civilian security department totaled 9 million in 2019 and 8 million in both 2018 and 2017 

cerro verde like all businesses and residents of peru relies on the peru government for the maintenance of public order upholding the rule of law and the protection of personnel and property the peru government is responsible for employing police personnel and directing their operations cerro verde has limited public security forces in support of its operation with the arrangement defined through a memorandum of understanding with the peru national police cerro verde’s share of support costs for governmentprovided security approximated 1 million in each of the years 2019 2018 and 2017 

indonesia  in 1996 ptfi established the freeport partnership fund for community development the partnership fund through which ptfi has made available funding and technical assistance to support community development initiatives in the areas of health education economic development and local infrastructure ptfi had committed through december 31 2019 to provide one percent of its annual revenue for the development of the local communities in its area of operations through the partnership fund negotiations to extend this agreement are currently underway though ptfi will continue its contributions to ensure there are no interruptions in the implementation of approved projects ptfi recorded costs of 28 million in 2019  55 million in 2018 and 44 million in 2017 for this commitment 

historically the amungme and kamoro community development organization  lembaga pengembangan masyarakat amungme dan kamoro  oversaw disbursement of the program funds ptfi contributed to the partnership fund throughout 2019 ptfi consulted with key stakeholders to restructure the management of the partnership fund in compliance with ptfi’s iupk beginning in february 2020 the partnership fund is now managed by a legally recognized indonesian foundation  yayasan pemberdayaan masyarakat amungme dan kamoro or ypmak ypmak is governed by a board of governors consisting of seven representatives including four from ptfi 

in addition to the partnership fund ptfi has made and expects to continue making annual investments in public health education community infrastructure and local economic development 

security matters    consistent with our ongoing commitment to protect our employees and property we have taken steps to provide a safe and secure working environment as part of its security program ptfi maintains its own internal civilian security department both employees and contractors are unarmed and perform functions such as protecting company facilities monitoring shipments of supplies and products assisting in traffic control and aiding in emergency response operations the security department receives human rights training annually 

ptfi’s costs for its internal civilian security department totaled 52 million in 2019  59 million in 2018 and 54 million in 2017  

ptfi like all businesses and residents of indonesia relies on the indonesia government for the maintenance of public order upholding the rule of law and protection of personnel and property the grasberg minerals district has been designated by the indonesia government as one of indonesia’s vital national assets this designation results in the police and to a lesser extent the military playing a significant role in protecting the area of our operations the indonesia government is responsible for employing police and military personnel and directing their operations 

from the outset of ptfi’s operations the indonesia government has looked to ptfi to provide logistical and infrastructure support and assistance for these necessary services because of the limited resources of the indonesia government and the remote location of and lack of development in papua ptfi’s financial support of the indonesia government security institutions assigned to ptfi’s operations area represents a prudent response to ptfi’s requirements and commitments to protect its workforce and property and better ensuring that personnel are properly fed and lodged and have the logistical resources to patrol ptfi’s roads and secure its area of operations in addition the provision of such support is consistent with our philosophy of responsible corporate citizenship and reflects our commitment to pursue practices that respect human rights 

ptfi’s support costs for the governmentprovided security totaled 22 million in 2019  27 million in 2018 and 23 million in 2017  this supplemental support consists of various infrastructure and other costs including food housing fuel travel vehicle repairs allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs and community assistance programs conducted by the military and police

mining production and sales data 



 

mineral reserves 

proven and probable reserves were determined by the use of mapping drilling sampling assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry as more fully discussed below the term “reserve” as used in the reserve data presented here means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination the term “proven reserves” means reserves for which i quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops trenches workings or drill holes ii grade andor quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and iii the sites for inspection sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established the term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced the degree of assurance although lower than that for proven reserves is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 

our mineral reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies we conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk we revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies refer to item 1a “risk factors” for discussion of risks associated with our estimates of proven and probable reserves 

estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves at december 31 2019  were determined using metals price assumptions of 250 per pound for copper 1200 per ounce for gold and 10 per pound for molybdenum 

for the threeyear period ended december 31 2019  lme copper settlement prices averaged 283 per pound london pm gold prices averaged 1306 per ounce and the weekly average price for molybdenum quoted by metals week averaged 1050 per pound 

the estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves presented in the table below represent the estimated metal quantities from which we expect to be paid after application of estimated metallurgical recovery rates and smelter recovery rates where applicable recoverable reserves are that part of a mineral deposit that we estimate can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination 







 

the reserve table above and the tables on the following pages utilize the abbreviations described below 

  

 







 

in defining our openpit reserves we apply a “variable cutoff grade” strategy the objective of this strategy is to maximize the net present value of our operations we use a “breakeven cutoff grade” to define the insitu reserves for our underground ore bodies the breakeven cutoff grade is defined for a metric ton of ore as that equivalent copper grade once produced and sold that generates sufficient revenue to cover all operating and administrative costs associated with our production 

our copper mines may contain other commercially recoverable metals such as gold molybdenum and silver we value all commercially recoverable metals in terms of a copper equivalent percentage to determine a single cutoff grade copper equivalent percentage is used to express the relative value of multimetal ores in terms of one metal the calculation expresses the relative value of the ore using estimates of contained metal quantities metals prices as used for reserve determination recovery rates treatment charges and royalties our molybdenum properties use a molybdenum cutoff grade 

the table below shows the minimum cutoff grade by process for each of our existing ore bodies as of december 31 2019  



drill hole spacing data is used by mining professionals such as geologists and geological engineers in determining the suitability of data coverage on a relative basis in a given deposit type and mining method scenario so as to achieve a given level of confidence in the resource estimate drill hole spacing is only one of several criteria necessary to establish resource classification drilling programs are typically designed to achieve an optimum sample spacing to support the level of confidence in results that apply to a particular stage of development of a mineral deposit 

the following table sets forth the average drill hole spacing based on average sample distance or drill pattern spacing for proven and probable ore reserves by process type 



production sequencing 

the following chart illustrates our current plans for sequencing and producing our proven and probable reserves at each of our ore bodies and the years in which we currently expect production from each ore body and related stockpiles our proven and probable ore reserves in indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041 and our current mine plan and planned operations are based on the assumption that ptfi will comply with its obligations under the iupk and receive the second 10year extension from 2031 through 2041 refer to item 1a “risk factors” and note 13 for further discussion production volumes are typically lower in the first few years for each ore body as development activities are ongoing and as the mine ramps up to full production and production volumes may also be lower as the mine reaches the end of its life the sequencing dates shown in the chart below include development activity that results in metal production the ultimate timing of the start of production from our undeveloped mines is dependent upon a number of factors including the results of our exploration and development efforts and may vary from the dates shown below in addition we develop our mine plans based on maximizing the net present value from the ore bodies significant additional capital expenditures will be required at many of these mines in order to achieve the lifeofmine plans reflected below 

mill and leach stockpiles 

mill and leach stockpiles generally contain lower grade ores that have been extracted from an ore body and are available for metal recovery mill stockpiles contain sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through milling concentrating smelting and refining or alternatively by concentrate leaching leach stockpiles contain oxide ores and certain secondary sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities 

because it is impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count reasonable estimation methods are employed the quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grades of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles 

expected copper recovery rates for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing the recoverable copper in mill stockpiles once entered into the production process can be produced into copper concentrate almost immediately 

expected copper recovery rates for leach stockpiles are determined using smallscale laboratory tests small to largescale column testing which simulates the production process historical trends and other factors including mineralogy of the ore and rock type total copper recovery in leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low percentage to more than 90 percent depending on several variables including processing methodology processing variables mineralogy and particle size of the rock for newly placed material on active stockpiles as much as 80 percent of total copper recovery may be extracted during the first year and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years processes and recovery rates are monitored regularly and recovery rate estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes 

following are our stockpiles and the estimated recoverable copper contained within those stockpiles as of december 31 2019  

 

mineralized material 

we hold various properties containing mineralized material that we believe could be brought into production should market conditions warrant however permitting and significant capital expenditures would be required before operations could commence at these properties mineralized material is a mineralized body that has been delineated by appropriately spaced drilling andor underground sampling to support the reported tonnage and average metal grades such a deposit cannot qualify as recoverable proven and probable reserves until legal and economic feasibility are confirmed based upon a comprehensive evaluation of development costs unit costs grades recoveries and other material factors estimated mineralized materials as presented on the following page were assessed using prices of 300 per pound for copper 1200 per ounce for gold 12 per pound for molybdenum and 20 per ounce for silver refer to item 1a “risk factors” for discussion of risks associated with our estimates of mineralized material

financial risks 

fluctuations in the market prices of the commodities we produce primarily copper gold and molybdenum have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in our financial performance and in the trading prices of our common stock and debt extended declines in the market prices of copper gold and to a lesser extent molybdenum could adversely affect our earnings cash flows and asset values and if sustained may adversely affect our ability to repay debt 

our financial results will vary with fluctuations in the market prices of the commodities we produce primarily copper and gold and to a lesser extent molybdenum an extended decline in market prices of these commodities could have a material adverse effect on our financial results the value of our assets andor our ability to repay our debt and meet our other fixed obligations and may depress the trading prices of our common stock and of our publicly traded debt securities 

additionally if market prices for our primary commodities decline for a sustained period of time we may have to revise our operating plans including curtailing production reducing operating costs and capital expenditures and discontinuing certain exploration and development programs we may be unable to decrease our costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues in which case we may incur losses and those losses may be material 

fluctuations in commodities prices are caused by varied and complex factors beyond our control including global supply and demand balances and inventory levels global economic and political conditions international regulatory trade and tax policies including national tariffs commodities investment activity and speculation interest rates the strength of the us dollar compared to foreign currencies the price and availability of substitute products and changes in technology volatility in global economic growth particularly in developing economies has the potential to adversely affect future demand and prices for commodities geopolitical uncertainty including the united kingdom’s exit from the european union commonly referred to as brexit and protectionism have the potential to inhibit international trade and negatively impact business confidence which creates the risk of constraints on our ability to trade in certain markets and has the potential to increase price volatility 

copper prices may be affected by demand from china which has become the largest consumer of refined copper in the world and by changes in demand for industrial commercial and residential products containing copper china’s economy continues to struggle with rising debt levels softening domestic consumer demand the effects of a prolonged trade war and more recently the coronavirus outbreak which has led to the temporary closure of some manufacturing activities in china although our sales to date have not been significantly affected a continued slowing in china’s economic growth the adoption and expansion of trade restrictions changes in chinaus relations or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies are difficult to predict and could adversely affect copper prices demand for our products our costs our customers our suppliers and the us economy which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

copper prices have fluctuated historically with london metal exchange lme copper settlement prices ranging from 248 per pound to 329 per pound during the three years ended december 31 2019  lme copper settlement prices averaged 272 per pound in 2019 296 per pound in 2018 and 280 per pound in 2017 the lme copper settlement price was 279 per pound on december 31 2019  and 253 per pound on january 31 2020  

factors affecting gold prices may include the relative strength of the us dollar to other currencies inflation and interest rate expectations purchases and sales of gold by governments and central banks demand from china and india two of the world ’ s largest consumers of gold and global demand for jewelry containing gold the london pm gold price averaged 1393 per ounce in 2019 1268 per ounce in 2018 and 1257 per ounce in 2017 the london pm gold price was 1515 per ounce on december 30 2019 there was no london pm gold price quote on december 31 2019  and 1584 per ounce on january 31 2020  

the metals week molybdenum dealer oxide weekly average price averaged 1137 per pound in 2019 1193 per pound in 2018 and 821 per pound in 2017 the metals week molybdenum dealer oxide weekly average price was 923 per pound on december 31 2019  and 1040 per pound on january 31 2020  

declines in prices of commodities we sell could result in metals inventory adjustments and impairment charges for our longlived assets refer to note 4 for additional information regarding metals inventory adjustments other events that could result in impairment of our longlived assets include but are not limited to decreases in estimated proven and probable mineral reserves and any event that might have a material adverse effect on current and future expected mine production costs 

our debt and other financial commitments may limit our financial and operating flexibility 

at december 31 2019  our total consolidated debt was  98 billion see note 8  and our total consolidated cash was 20 billion  we also have various other financial commitments including reclamation and environmental obligations takeorpay contracts and leases for further information refer to the risk factor below relating to mine closure and reclamation regulations and plugging and abandonment obligations related to our remaining oil and gas properties although we have been successful in repaying debt in the past and issuing new debt securities in capital markets transactions there can be no assurance that we can continue to do so in addition we may assume additional debt in future periods or reduce our holdings of cash and cash equivalents in connection with funding existing operations capital expenditures dividends or in pursuing other business opportunities 

our level of indebtedness and other financial commitments could have important consequences to our business including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

any failure to comply with the financial and other covenants in our debt agreements may result in an event of default that would allow the creditors to accelerate maturities of the related debt which in turn may trigger crossacceleration or crossdefault provisions in other debt agreements our available cash and liquidity may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our debt instruments that may be accelerated upon an event of default 

as of january 31 2020  our senior unsecured debt was rated “bb“ with a stable outlook by standard  poor’s sp “bb” with a stable outlook by fitch ratings fitch and “ba1” with a stable outlook by moody’s investors service moody’s if we are unable to maintain our indebtedness and financial ratios at levels acceptable to these credit rating agencies or should our business prospects deteriorate  our current credit ratings could be 

downgraded which could adversely affect the value of our outstanding securities and existing debt and our ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms and could increase our borrowing costs 

certain of our debt agreements including our revolving credit facility use the london interbank offered rate libor as a reference rate in july 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 which could cause market volatility or disruption if libor is unavailable after 2021 our debt with interest rates that are indexed to libor will be determined using various alternative methods to the extent provided for in our agreements which could result in increases in interest rates on such debt further we may need to renegotiate our debt agreements and the loans that utilize libor to replace libor with the new standard that is established by the us alternative rate reference committee which is currently expected to be the secured overnight bank financing rate it is not possible to predict the effect of these changes other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates on our borrowing costs or the capital markets generally  

mine closure and reclamation regulations impose substantial costs on our operations and include requirements that we provide financial assurance supporting those obligations we also have plugging and abandonment obligations related to our remaining oil and gas properties and are required to provide bonds or other forms of financial assurance in connection with those properties changes in or the failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us 

we are required by us federal and state laws and regulations to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans for our mining properties if we are unable to do so most of our financial assurance obligations are imposed by state laws that vary significantly by jurisdiction depending on how each state regulates land use and groundwater quality the us environmental protection agency epa and state agencies may also require financial assurance for investigation and remediation actions that are required under settlements of enforcement actions under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 cercla or similar state laws refer to note 12 for additional information regarding our financial assurance obligations 

we are also subject to financial assurance requirements in connection with our remaining oil and gas properties under both state and federal laws including financial responsibility required under the oil pollution act of 1990 to cover containment and cleanup costs resulting from an oil spill in 2016 the us bureau of ocean energy management boem issued revised requirements for lessees operating in federal waters to secure the cost of plugging abandoning decommissioning andor removing wells platforms and pipelines at the end of production the revised requirements eliminate previously provided waivers from requirements to post security in early 2017 the boem announced a delay in the implementation of certain aspects of the rules pending further review and in june 2017 boem further extended the start date for implementation indefinitely this extension currently remains in effect if implemented the new requirements could require us to post security in the form of bonds or similar assurances the cost for bonds or other forms of assurances can be substantial and there is no assurance that they can be obtained in all cases 

as of december 31 2019  our financial assurance obligations totaled 13 billion for closure and reclamationrestoration costs of us mining sites and 05 billion for plugging and abandonment obligations of our remaining oil and gas properties a substantial portion of our financial assurance obligations are satisfied by fcx and subsidiary guarantees and financial capability demonstrations our ability to continue to provide guarantees and financial capability demonstrations depends on state and other regulatory requirements our financial performance and our financial condition other forms of assurance such as letters of credit and surety bonds are costly to provide and depending on our financial condition and market conditions may be difficult or impossible to obtain failure to provide the required financial assurance could result in the closure of the affected properties 

the laws and regulations governing mine closure and remediation in a particular jurisdiction and oil and gas properties plugging and abandonment obligations are subject to review at any time and may be amended to impose additional requirements and conditions which may cause our provisions for environmental and asset retirement obligations to be underestimated and could materially affect our financial position or results of operations refer to notes 1 and 12  for further discussion of our environmental and asset retirement obligations 

unanticipated litigation or negative developments in pending litigation or with respect to other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

we are involved in numerous legal proceedings and subject to other contingencies that have arisen or may arise in the ordinary course of our business or are associated with environmental issues including those described in note 12 and in item 3 “legal proceedings” involving matters such as remediation restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination claims of personal injury or property damage arising from such contamination or from exposure to substances such as lead arsenic asbestos talc and other allegedly toxic substances disputes over water rights and disputes with foreign governments or regulatory authorities over royalties taxes rights and obligations under concession or other agreements or other matters we are also involved periodically in other reviews inquiries investigations and other proceedings initiated by or involving government agencies some of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief in addition from time to time we are involved in disputes over the allocation of environmental remediation obligations at superfund and other sites the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant monetary damages penalties other sanctions or injunctive relief against us limitations on our property rights or regulatory interpretations that increase our operating costs management does not believe based on currently available information that the outcome of any individual legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition although individual or cumulative outcomes could be material to our operating results for a particular period depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period 

we may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to   our defined benefit pension plans 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for certain current and former employees in the us and a few pension plans for nonus locations which provide for specified payments after retirement the major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets investment returns interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet a sustained period of low or insufficient returns could require us to fund our pension plans to a greater extent than anticipated refer to note 9 for further discussion 

international risks 

our international operations are subject to political economic social and regional risks of doing business in countries outside the us 

we are a usbased mining company with substantial assets located outside of the us we conduct international mining operations in indonesia peru and chile and exploration activities in various foreign jurisdictions accordingly in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in countries outside the us our business may be adversely affected by political economic social and regional uncertainties in each of these countries risks of conducting business in countries outside the us include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our insurance does not cover most losses caused by the above described risks accordingly our exploration development and production activities outside of the us may be substantially affected by many unpredictable factors beyond our control some of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

our international operations must comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption and antibribery laws of the other jurisdictions in which we operate there has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of these laws in recent years we operate in jurisdictions that have experienced public and private sector corruption and where significant anticorruption enforcement activities prosecutions and settlements have occurred there can be no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from misinterpretation of or noncompliance with applicable laws and internal policies recklessness fraudulent behavior dishonesty or other inappropriate acts committed by our affiliates employees agents or contractors as such our corporate policies and processes may not prevent or detect all potential breaches of law or other governance practices any violation of anticorruption or antibribery laws could result in significant criminal or civil fines and penalties litigation and loss of operating licenses or permits and may damage our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

we are involved in several significant tax proceedings and other tax disputes with indonesia and peru tax authorities refer to note 12 for further discussion of these matters other risks specific to certain countries in which we operate are discussed in more detail below 

because our mining operations in indonesia are a significant operating asset our business may be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties in indonesia 

our indonesia mining operations include the grasberg minerals district one of the world’s largest copper and gold deposits these operations are conducted by our subsidiary ptfi pursuant to a special mining license iupk issued by the indonesia government refer to note 13 for a summary of the iupk’s key fiscal terms 

maintaining a good working relationship with the indonesia government is important because of the significance of our indonesia operations to our business and because our mining operations there are among indonesia’s most significant business enterprises the grasberg minerals district has been designated by the indonesia government as one of indonesia’s vital national assets partially because of its significance to indonesia’s economy the environmentally sensitive area where it is located and the number of people employed our indonesia operations have been the subject of political debates and of criticism in the indonesia press and have been the target of protests and occasional violence improper management of our working relationship with the indonesia government could lead to a disruption of operations andor impact our reputation in indonesia and in the region 

where we operate which could adversely affect our business in addition pt indonesia asahan aluminium persero pt inalum a shareholder in ptfi is an indonesia stateowned enterprise disputes between us and pt inalum may result in litigation or arbitration which could increase our expenses and distract our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business and could create tensions with the indonesia government 

the indonesia mining industry is subject to extensive regulation within indonesia and there have been major developments in laws and regulations applicable to mining concession holders some of which have conflicted with ptfi’s contractual rights in the past in particular the enactment of law no 4 of 2009 on coal and mineral mining on january 12 2009 the mining law replaced the previous regulatory framework which allowed concession holders including ptfi to conduct mining activities in indonesia under a contract of work system the mining law which sets out the regulatory framework for the mining industry in indonesia only contains substantive principles and leaves many specific issues to be addressed in implementing regulations some of which have conflicted with ptfi’s contractual rights in the past including but not limited to regulations that imposed a progressive export duty on copper concentrate restricted exports of copper concentrate and anode slimes increased royalty rates and required payment of a smelter assurance bond to support a commitment to construct a new smelter in indonesia refer to note 13 for further discussion of the smelter assurance bond in january 2017 ptfi suspended exports through april 2017 in response to these mining law regulations 

the mining law stipulated that previously granted mining rights through a contract of work would continue to be valid until expiry subject to certain adjustments ptfi’s former contract of work cow was concluded pursuant to the 1967 foreign capital investment law which provided basic guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization a framework for economic incentives and basic rules regarding other rights and obligations of foreign investors the initial term of ptfi’s former cow was scheduled to expire in 2021 and explicitly provided that it could be extended for two 10year periods subject to indonesia government approval which could not be withheld or delayed unreasonably prior to the issuance of the iupk to ptfi in december 2018 ptfi had been engaged in discussions with the indonesia government since 2012 regarding various provisions of its former cow including extending its term notwithstanding provisions in ptfi’s former cow prohibiting it from doing so the indonesia government sought to modify ptfi’s former cow to address provisions contained in the mining law and implementing regulations adopted thereunder some of which were not required under or conflicted with ptfi’s former cow including but not limited to i restrictions on ptfi’s basic right to export mining products ii imposition of additional export duties and higher royalty rates iii imposition of excess surface water taxes refer to note 12  iv imposition of new requirement to build additional smelter capacity in indonesia v unreasonable withholding and delay in granting approval of two successive tenyear extensions of the term of the former cow and vi imposition of new divestment requirements 

in early 2017 the indonesia government issued new regulations to address exports of unrefined metals including copper concentrate and anode slimes and other matters related to the mining sector ptfi’s export license for copper concentrate is valid for one year periods subject to review and approval by the indonesia government every six months depending on smelter construction progress ptfi’s export license expires on march 8 2020 the 2017 regulations also permit the export of anode slimes which is necessary for pt smelting ptfi’s 25percentowned copper smelter and refinery located in gresik indonesia to continue operating pt smelting’s export license for anode slimes expires on march 11 2020 in addition to a delay in the renewal of its export license for anode slimes in 2017 pt smelting’s operations were shut down from midjanuary 2017 until early march 2017 as a result of labor disturbances copper concentrate sales to pt smelting totaled over 10 percent of our consolidated revenues for each of the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 we cannot predict when ptfi’s copper concentrate license and pt smelting’s anode slimes export license may be renewed ptfi’s sale of concentrates could be interrupted if either of these export license is not timely renewed or if pt smelting is unable to operate either due to other operational or financial constraints which would adversely impact our revenues and operations 

we cannot assure you that future regulatory changes affecting the mining industry in indonesia will not be introduced or unexpectedly repealed or that new interpretations of existing laws and regulations will not be issued which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we will not mine all of ptfi’s ore reserves in the grasberg minerals district before the initial term of ptfi’s iupk expires in 2031 and the iupk may not be extended through 2041 if ptfi fails to abide by the terms and conditions of the iupk and applicable laws and regulations 

on december 21 2018 ptfi was granted an iupk to replace its former cow enabling ptfi to conduct operations in the grasberg minerals district through 2041 under the terms of the iupk ptfi has been granted mining rights through 2031 with rights to extend its mining rights through 2041 subject to among other things ptfi completing the construction of a new smelter in indonesia by december 21 2023 and fulfilling its defined fiscal obligations to the indonesia government refer to note 13 for a summary of the iupk’s key fiscal terms 

the iupk also requires ptfi to pay duties on concentrate exports of 5 percent declining to 25 percent when smelter development progress exceeds 30 percent and eliminated when smelter development progress exceeds 50 percent smelter development progress will be determined by an independent verifier appointed by the ministry of energy and mineral resources memr and subject to approval by the memr engineering and frontend engineering and design for the selected process technology are ongoing with construction of the smelter expected to begin in 2020 the preliminary capital cost estimate for the project approximates 3 billion and ptfi is pursuing financing and commercial arrangements for this project the economics of the new smelter will be borne by ptfi’s shareholders according to their respective share ownership percentages ptfi’s ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions future market prices as well as ptfi’s operational performance cash flow and debt position among other factors financing may not be available when needed or if available the terms of such financing may not be favorable to ptfi 

our proven and probable ore reserves in indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041 and ptfi’s current longterm mine plan and planned operations are based on the assumption that ptfi will abide by the terms and conditions of the iupk and will be granted the 10year extension from 2031 through 2041 as a result we will not mine all of these ore reserves during the initial term of the iupk prior to the end of 2031 we expect to mine 52 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable ore at december 31 2019  representing 56 percent of our net equity share of recoverable copper reserves and 62 percent of our net equity share of recoverable gold reserves 

if ptfi does not complete the construction of a new smelter in indonesia by december 21 2023 or fulfill its defined fiscal obligations to the indonesia government as set forth in the iupk the iupk will likely not be extended from 2031 to 2041 and we would be unable to mine all of ptfi’s ore reserves in the grasberg minerals district which would adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position 

operational risks 

our mining operations are subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our business and our underground mining operations can be particularly dangerous 

our mines are very large in scale and by their nature are subject to significant operational risks some of which are outside of our control and many of which are not covered fully or in some cases even partially by insurance these operational risks which could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and cash flow include earthquakes rainstorms floods and other natural disasters environmental hazards including discharge of metals concentrates pollutants or hazardous chemicals surface or underground fires equipment failures accidents including in connection with mining equipment milling equipment or conveyor systems transportation of chemicals explosives or other materials and in the transportation of employees and business partners to and from sites wall failures and rock slides in our openpit mines and structural collapses of our underground mines or tailings impoundments lower than expected ore grades or recovery rates and unexpected geological formations or conditions whether in mineral or gaseous form 

we are facing continued geotechnical challenges due to the older age of some of our mines and a trend toward mining deeper pits and more complex deposits no assurances can be given that unanticipated geotechnical and hydrological conditions may or may not occur nor whether these conditions may lead to events such as landslides and pit wall failures in the future or that such events will be detected in advance geotechnical instabilities can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control such as seismic activity or severe weather which may lead to floods mudslides pitwall instability and possibly even slippage of material during the first quarter of 2019 our el abra operation in chile experienced heavy rainfall and electrical storms as a result our operating results for 2019 were impacted by a suspension of el abra’s crushed leach stacking operations 

for approximately 35 days we cannot predict whether similar events will occur in the future or the extent to which any such event would affect this or any of our other operations 

for a discussion of risks specific to our tailings management see below “ our management of waste rock and tailings are subject to significant environmental safety and engineering challenges and risks that could adversely affect our business” 

underground mining operations can be particularly dangerous and in may 2013 a tragic accident which resulted in 28 fatalities and 10 injuries occurred at ptfi when the rock structure above the ceiling of an underground training facility collapsed ptfi temporarily suspended mining and processing activities at the grasberg complex to conduct inspections and resumed openpit mining and concentrating activities in june 2013 and underground operations in july 2013 no assurance can be given that similar events will not occur in the future 

in addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry our indonesia mining operations involve additional 

risks given their location in steep mountainous terrain in a remote area of indonesia these conditions have required us to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities the area also receives extreme rainfall which has led to periodic floods and mudslides further the mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time 

we maintain insurance to cover some of these risks and hazards however our insurance may not sufficiently cover losses from an unexpected natural or operating disaster we maintain insurance in amounts that are believed to be reasonable depending on the circumstances surrounding the identified risk no assurance can be given that such insurance will continue to be available or that it will be available at economically feasible premiums or that we will be able to obtain or maintain such insurance in addition we do not have coverage for certain environmental losses and other risks as such coverage cannot be purchased at a commercially reasonable cost the lack of or insufficiency of insurance coverage could adversely affect our cash flow and overall profitability 

the occurrence of one or more of these events in connection with our exploration activities and development of and production from mining operations may result in the death of or personal injury to our employees other personnel or third parties the loss of mining equipment damage to or destruction of mineral properties or production facilities significant repair costs monetary losses deferral or unanticipated fluctuations in production extensive community disruption loss of licenses permits or necessary approvals to operate loss of infrastructure and services disruption to essential supplies or delivery of our products environmental damage and potential legal liabilities all of which may adversely affect our reputation business prospects results of operations and financial position 

our management of waste rock and tailings are subject to significant environmental safety and engineering challenges and risks that could adversely affect our business 

the waste rock including overburden and tailings produced in our mining operations represent our largest volume of waste material managing the volume of waste rock and tailings presents significant environmental safety and engineering challenges and risks primarily relating to structural stability geochemistry water quality and dust generation management of this waste is regulated in the jurisdictions where we operate and our programs are designed to be in compliance with applicable national state and local laws permits and approved environmental impact studies 

we maintain large leach pads and tailings impoundments containing viscous material which are effectively large embankments that must be engineered constructed and monitored to ensure structural stability and avoid leakages or structural collapse our tailings impoundments in arid areas must have effective programs to suppress fugitive dust emissions and we must effectively monitor and treat acid rock drainage at all of our operations in indonesia we use a river transport system for tailings management which presents other risks discussed in more detail below under environmental risks  “ our indonesia mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges and future changes in environmental laws or unanticipated environmental impacts from those operations could require us to incur increased costs ” 

affiliates of our company currently operate 18 tailings storage facilities 16 in the us and 2 in peru and manage 58 in the us that are inactive or closed approximately threefourths of the inactive facilities have been closed our inventory of tailings storage facilities comprises 13 active and 52 inactive or closed facilities with an upstream design 5 active and 5 inactive with a centerline design and 1 closed facility with a downstream design in 2019 the company produced approximately 309 million metric tons of tailings the failure of tailings and other embankments 

at any of our mining operations could cause severe and in some cases catastrophic property and environmental damage and loss of life as well as adverse effects on our business and reputation many of our tailings storage facilities are located in areas where a failure has the potential to impact individual dwellings and a limited number of impoundments are in areas where a failure has the potential to impact nearby communities or mining infrastructure as a result our programs take into account the significant consequences resulting from a potential failure and we apply substantial financial resources and both internal and external technical resources to the safe management of all those facilities our tailings management and stewardship program which involves qualified external engineers of record and periodic oversight by independent tailings technical review boards and our tailings stewardship team complies with the tailings governance framework on preventing catastrophic failure of tailings storage facilities adopted in december 2016 by the international council on mining and metals icmm and required to be implemented by icmm members we continue to enhance our existing practices and work with icmm on additional initiatives to strengthen the design operation and closure of tailings storage facilities in an effort to reduce the risk of severe or catastrophic failure of those facilities however no assurance can be given that these events will not occur in the future 

the importance of careful design management and monitoring of large impoundments has been emphasized in recent years by large scale tailings dam failures at unaffiliated mines which resulted in numerous fatalities and caused extensive property and environmental damage as a result of recent failures international groups are drafting standards that management may elect to implement at our tailings storage facilities these standards if implemented could require changes to our tailings stewardship program and approaches although it is uncertain if these changes would result in material capital or operating cost increases 

based on observations from such recent tailings failures in addition to fatalities and severe personal property and environmental damages these events could result in limited or restricted access to mine sites suspension of operations decrease in reserves legal liability possibly involving the freezing of assets government investigations additional regulations and restrictions on mining operations in response to any such failure increased monitoring costs and production costs increased insurance costs or inability to obtain insurance increased costs andor limited access to capital remediation costs inability to comply with any additional safety requirements or obtain necessary certifications evacuation or relocation of communities or other emergency action and other impacts which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position 

labor unrest violence activism and civil and religious strife could disrupt our operations and may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

as of december 31 2019  approximately 37 percent of our global labor force was covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 21 percent of our global labor force was covered by agreements that have expired and are currently being negotiated or will expire during 2020 

labor agreements are negotiated on a periodic basis and may not be renewed on reasonably satisfactory terms to us or at all if we do not successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements with our union workers we may incur prolonged strikes and other work stoppages at our mining operations which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations additionally if we enter into a new labor agreement with any union that significantly increases our labor costs relative to our competitors our ability to compete may be materially and adversely affected refer to items 1 and 2 “business and properties” for additional information regarding labor matters and expiration dates of such agreements 

we could experience labor disruptions such as work stoppages work slowdowns union organizing campaigns strikes or lockouts that could adversely affect our operations for example during thirdquarter 2016 ptfi experienced labor productivity issues and a 10day work stoppage that began in late september 2016 these labor productivity issues continued during fourthquarter 2016 and the first half of 2017 beginning in midapril 2017 ptfi experienced a high level of worker absenteeism which unfavorably impacted mining and milling rates a significant number of employees and contractors elected to participate in an illegal strike action beginning in may 2017 and were subsequently deemed to have voluntarily resigned under existing indonesia laws and regulations resulting in increased costs associated with employee severance we cannot predict whether additional labor disruptions will occur significant reductions in productivity or protracted work stoppages at one or more of our operations could significantly reduce our production and sales volumes or disrupt operations which could adversely affect our cash flow results of operations and financial condition 

south american countries have historically experienced uneven periods of economic growth as well as recession periods of high inflation and general economic and political instability during 2019 both peru and chile experienced significant and prolonged civil unrest unrelated to our operations production and sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 were impacted by protests associated with an unaffiliated copper development project in peru that blocked access to the shipping ports and main transportation routes while the civil unrest did not significantly impact our results for 2019 if it continues our south america operations could be materially impacted and as a result we may not be able to meet our production and sales targets we cannot predict whether similar or more significant incidents of civil unrest will occur in the future in peru or chile 

indonesia has long faced separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces several separatist groups have sought increased political independence for the province of papua where our grasberg minerals district is located in papua there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the indonesia military and police in addition illegal miners have periodically clashed with police who have attempted for years to move them away from our facilities social economic and political instability in papua could materially and adversely affect us if it results in damage to our property or interruption of our indonesia operations 

in 2009 a series of shooting incidents occurred within the ptfi project area including along the road leading to our mining and milling operations the shooting incidents continued on a sporadic basis through january 2015 during this time there were 20 fatalities and more than 50 injuries to our employees contractor employees government security personnel and civilians the next shooting incident occurred in august 2017 and a series of shooting incidents continued on a sporadic basis within the ptfi project area and in nearby areas through january 2020 resulting in 2 fatalities and 25 injuries in december 2018 a mass shooting incident targeting a highway construction crew occurred in a remote mountain area approximately 100 miles east of the ptfi project area resulting in at least 19 fatalities and several reported as missing separatist security incidents including shootings continue to be sporadically reported and ptfi continues to monitor the occurrence of incidents in the region 

the safety of our workforce is a critical concern and ptfi continues to work with the indonesia government to address security issues within the ptfi project area and in nearby areas we continue to limit the use of the road leading to our mining and milling operations to secured convoys including transport of personnel by armored vehicles in designated areas 

we cannot predict whether additional incidents will occur that could disrupt or suspend our operations if other disruptive incidents occur they could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in ways that we cannot predict at this time 

our mining operations depend on the availability of significant quantities of secure water supplies 

our mining operations require physical availability and secure legal rights to significant quantities of water for mining and ore processing activities and related support facilities most of our north america and south america mining operations are in areas where competition for water supplies is significant continuous production at our mines is dependent on many factors including our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies 

as discussed in item 3 “legal proceedings” in arizona where our operations use both surface and groundwater we are a participant in an active general stream adjudication in which arizona courts have been attempting for over 40 years to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for the gila river one of the state’s largest river systems this stream adjudication primarily affects our morenci safford and sierrita mines the adjudication is addressing the state law claims of thousands of competing users including us as well as significant federal water claims that are potentially adverse to the state law claims of both surface water and groundwater users groundwater is treated differently from surface water under arizona law which historically allowed landowners to pump subsurface water subject only to the requirement of putting it to “reasonable use” however court decisions in the adjudication have concluded that some underground water constitutes “subflow” that is to be treated legally as surface water and is therefore subject to the arizona doctrine of prior appropriation and subject to the adjudication and potentially unavailable to groundwater pumpers in the absence of valid surface water claims any recharacterization of groundwater as surface water could affect the ability of consumers farmers ranchers municipalities and industrial users like us to continue to access water supplies that have been relied on for decades because we are a user of both groundwater and surface water in arizona we are an active participant in the adjudication proceedings given the legal and technical complexity of these adjudications their long history and their longterm legal economic and 

political implications it is difficult to predict the timing or the outcome of these proceedings if we are not able to satisfactorily resolve the issues being addressed in the adjudications our ability to pump groundwater could be diminished or curtailed and our operations at morenci safford and sierrita could be adversely affected unless we are able to acquire alternative resources 

water for our cerro verde operation in peru comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the rio chili watershed that collects water primarily from seasonal precipitation as a result of occasional drought conditions temporary supply shortages are possible that could affect our cerro verde operations 

water for our el abra mining operation in chile comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascotán aquifer in 2010 el abra obtained regulatory approval for the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascotán aquifer for its sulfide processing plant which began operations in 2011 the agreement to pump from this aquifer is subject to continued monitoring of the aquifer level to ensure that environmentally sensitive areas are not impacted by our pumping if impact occurs we would have to reduce pumping to restore water levels which could have an adverse effect on production from el abra 

although we typically have sufficient water for our indonesia operations the area receives considerable rainfall that has led to periodic floods and mudslides lower rainfall could affect our water supply availability from time to time 

although each of our mining operations currently has access to sufficient water supplies to support current operational demands as discussed above some supplies are subject to adjudication proceedings the outcome of which we cannot predict and the availability of additional supplies that may be required for potential future expansions is uncertain while we are taking actions to acquire additional backup water supplies such supplies may not be available at acceptable cost or at all so that the loss of a water right or currently available water supply could force us to curtail operations or force premature closures thereby increasing andor accelerating costs or foregoing profitable operations 

development projects are inherently risky and may require more capital than anticipated which could adversely affect our business the development of our underground mines and operations are also subject 

to other unique risks 

mine development projects typically require a number of years and significant expenditures during the development phase before production is possible currently our major projects include underground development activities in the grasberg minerals district which currently constitutes approximately 31 percent of our estimated consolidated recoverable proven and probable copper reserves and completion of the lone star copper leach project in arizona there are many risks and uncertainties inherent in all development projects including but not limited to unexpected or difficult geological formations or conditions potential delays cost overruns lower levels of production during rampup periods shortages of material or labor construction defects breakdowns and injuries to persons and property the development of our underground mines and operations are also subject to other unique risks including but not limited to underground fires or floods ventilating harmful gases fallofground accidents and seismic activity resulting from unexpected or difficult geological formations or conditions while we anticipate taking all measures that we deem reasonable and prudent in connection with the development of our underground mines to safely manage production there is no assurance that these risks will not cause schedule delays revised mine plans injuries to persons and property or increased capital costs any of which may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition additionally although we devote significant time and resources to our project planning approval and review processes many of our development projects are highly complex and rely on factors that are outside of our control which may cause us to underestimate the time and capital required to complete a development project 

for example we experienced mining induced seismic activity in 2017 and 2018 at the deep mill level zone dmlz underground mine in the grasberg minerals district results to date of hydraulic fracturing activities to manage rock stresses and precondition the dmlz underground mine for largescale production have been effective however we cannot predict whether additional occurrences of seismic activity or other unexpected geological activity will occur that could cause schedule delays or additional revisions to ptfi’s mine plans which could adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

we must continually replace reserves depleted by production but exploration is highly speculative and our exploration activities may not result in additional discoveries 

our existing mineral reserves will be depleted over time by production from our operations because our profits are primarily derived from our mining operations our ability to replenish our mineral reserves is essential to our longterm success depleted reserves can be replaced in several ways including expanding known ore bodies by locating new deposits or acquiring interests in reserves from third parties exploration is highly speculative in nature involves many risks and uncertainties requires substantial capital expenditures and is frequently unsuccessful in discovering significant mineralization accordingly our current or future exploration programs may not result in the discovery of additional deposits that can be produced profitably even if significant mineralization is discovered it will likely take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production during which time the economic feasibility of production may change we may not be able to discover enhance develop or acquire reserves in sufficient quantities to maintain or grow our current reserve levels which could negatively affect our cash flow results of operations and financial condition 

estimates of proven and probable reserves and mineralized material are uncertain and the volume and grade of ore actually recovered may vary from our estimates 

our estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves have been calculated in accordance with industry guide 7 as required by the securities exchange act of 1934 there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating mineral reserves such estimates are to a large extent based on the average prices for the commodities we produce primarily copper gold and molybdenum and interpretations of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other exploration techniques which data may not necessarily be indicative of future results our mineral reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies we conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk we revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies geological assumptions about our mineralization that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available 

estimates of proven and probable reserves that will be recovered or the cost at which we anticipate reserves will be recovered are based on uncertain assumptions the uncertain global financial outlook may affect economic assumptions related to reserve recovery and may require reserve revisions changes to reserve estimates could affect our asset carrying values and may also negatively impact our future financial condition and results 

in addition if the market prices for the commodities we produce decline from recent levels if production costs increase or recovery rates decrease or if applicable laws and regulations are adversely changed we can offer no assurance that the indicated level of recovery will be realized or that mineral reserves can be mined or processed profitably if we determine that certain of our estimated proven and probable reserves have become uneconomic this may ultimately lead to a reduction in our aggregate reported reserves which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

additionally the term “mineralized material” does not indicate proven and probable reserves as defined by the us securities and exchange commission estimates of mineralized material are subject to further exploration and development and are therefore subject to considerable uncertainty mineralized material is a mineralized body that has been delineated by appropriately spaced drilling andor underground sampling to support the reported tonnage and average metal grades such a deposit cannot qualify as recoverable proven and probable reserves until legal and economic feasibility are confirmed based upon a comprehensive evaluation of development costs unit costs grades recoveries and other material factors and are therefore subject to considerable uncertainty accordingly no assurance can be given that the estimated mineralized material not included in reserves will become proven and probable reserves 

our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations some of which require permits and other approvals these regulations increase our costs and in some circumstances may delay or suspend our operations 

our operations are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations that are subject to change and to changing interpretation by governmental agencies and other bodies vested with broad supervisory authority as a mining company compliance with environmental legal requirements is an integral and costly part of our business for additional information see “environmental risks” below we are also subject to extensive regulation of worker 

health and safety including the requirements of the us occupational safety and health act and similar laws of other jurisdictions in the us the operation of our mines is subject to regulation by the us mine safety and health administration msha under the federal mine safety and health act of 1977 mine act msha inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the mine act additionally in the us various state agencies have concurrent jurisdiction arising under state law that regulate worker health and safety in both our industrial facilities and mines if regulatory inspections result in an alleged violation we may be subject to fines and penalties and in instances of alleged significant violations our mining operations or industrial facilities could be subject to temporary or extended closures refer to exhibit 951 to this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding certain orders and citations issued by msha for our operations during the year ended december 31 2019  

  

many other governmental bodies regulate other aspects of our operations and our failure to comply with these legal requirements can result in substantial penalties in addition new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations by courts or regulatory authorities occur regularly but are difficult to predict any such variations could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow results of operations and financial condition 

our business is dependent upon information technology systems which may be adversely affected by disruptions damage failure and risks associated with implementation and integration 

our industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies our strategy of operating large longlived geographically diverse assets has been increasingly dependent on our ability to become fully integrated and highly automated many of our business and operational processes are heavily dependent on traditional and emerging technology systems to conduct daytoday operations improve safety and efficiency and lower costs 

as our dependence on information systems including those of our third party service providers and vendors grows we become more vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks cybersecurity incidents are increasing in frequency and magnitude these incidents may include but are not limited to installation of malicious software phishing credential attacks unauthorized access to data and other advanced 

and sophisticated cybersecurity breaches and threats including threats that increasingly target critical operational 

technologies and process control networks if any of these threats materialize we could be subject to manipulation 

or improper use of our systems and networks production downtimes communication interruption or other disruptions and delays to our operations or to the transportation of products or infrastructure utilized by our operations unauthorized release of proprietary commercially sensitive confidential or otherwise protected information the corruption of data significant health and safety consequences environmental damage loss of intellectual property fines and litigation damage to our reputation or financial losses from remedial actions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow results of operations and financial condition we have experienced targeted and nontargeted cybersecurity incidents in the past and may experience them in the future while these cybersecurity incidents did not result in any material loss to us or interrupt our daytoday operations there can be no assurance that we will not experience any such losses in the future given the unpredictability of the timing and the evolving nature and scope of information technology disruptions the various procedures and controls we use to monitor and protect against these threats and to mitigate our potential risks to such threats may not be sufficient in preventing cybersecurity incidents from materializing further as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities to cybersecurity threats 

we could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective not installed properly or not properly integrated into our operations various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to system implementation and modification but system modification failures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations and could if not successfully implemented adversely impact the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 

in addition from time to time we pursue investments and initiatives to improve the productivity and efficiency of existing systems and operations including through investments in digital technologies during 2019 we advanced initiatives in our north america and south america mining operations to enhance productivity expand margins and reduce the capital intensity of the business through the utilization of new technology applications in combination with a more interactive operating structure the pilot program initiated at the bagdad mine in northwest arizona in late 2018 utilizes data science machine learning and integrated functional teams to address bottlenecks provide cost benefits and drive improved overall performance there can be no certainty that some or any of such 

investments and initiatives will meet our capital allocation objectives in addition certain of such investments and initiatives are still in the early stages of evaluation and additional engineering and other analysis is required to fully assess their impact further there can be no certainty as to the time required for us to extract value from these investments or initiatives or that we will achieve any anticipated savings or efficiency improvements 

environmental risks 

our operations are subject to complex evolving and increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations compliance with environmental regulatory requirements involves significant costs and may constrain existing operations or expansion opportunities 

our operations both in the us and internationally are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing the generation storage treatment transportation and disposal of hazardous substances solid waste disposal air emissions wastewater discharges remediation restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination including mine closures and reclamation well plug and abandonment requirements protection of endangered and protected species and designation of critical habitats and other related matters in addition we must obtain regulatory permits and approvals to start continue and expand operations 

our miami arizona smelter processes approximately half of the aggregate copper concentrate produced by our north america copper mines epa regulations required us to invest approximately 230 million in 2017 for new pollution control equipment to reduce sulfur dioxide so 2  to meet both regional haze requirements and to allow the arizona department of environmental quality adeq to demonstrate compliance with epa’s so 2 ambient air quality standards during 2019 and january 2020 there were several instances in which the so 2 levels exceeded the ambient standard we are engaged in discussions with adeq and conducting an ongoing investigation of the cause of the ambient levels we cannot guarantee that we will not be required to modify our systems or install additional equipment to address findings new requirements or for other reasons which could result in significant costs including increased capital expenditures and operating costs and could adversely impact our business 

laws such as cercla and similar state laws may expose us to joint and several liability for environmental damages caused by our operations or by previous owners or operators of properties we acquired or are currently operating or at sites where we sent materials for processing recycling or disposal as discussed in more detail in the next risk factor we have substantial obligations for environmental remediation on mining properties previously owned or operated by freeport minerals corporation fmc and certain of its affiliates noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in material penalties or other liabilities in addition compliance with these laws may from time to time result in delays in or changes to our development or expansion plans compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs which we expect will continue to increase over time because of increased regulatory oversight adoption of increasingly stringent environmental standards as well as other factors 

new or revised environmental regulatory requirements are frequently proposed many of which result in substantially increased costs for our business including those regarding financial assurance in the financial risk factor above for example criteria for manmade organic compounds that could be present in soil groundwater and surface water at our existing and former operations are currently under review by federal and state agencies 

in 2015 epa and the department of the army collectively the agencies adopted rules that added remote “tributaries” into the regulatory definition of “waters of the united states” that are protected by the clean water act thereby imposing significant additional restrictions on land uses in remote areas with only tenuous connections to active waterways these rules were challenged by multiple states and industry parties and litigation is ongoing on october 22 2019 the agencies published a final rule that repeals these 2015 rules and recodifies the regulations in place prior to adoption of the 2015 rules epa also published a proposed rule on february 14 2019 which revises the definition of “waters of the united states” to clarify the scope of waters federally regulated under the clean water act the final rule will become effective 60 days after it is published in the federal register this final rule could limit or eliminate our need to obtain federal permits for future expansions at our operations in arizona and new mexico we expect multiple legal challenges to the rule to be filed in federal district courts 

regulations have been considered at various governmental levels to increase federal financial responsibility requirements both for mine closure and reclamation and for oil and gas decommissioning in 2019 legislation was enacted in colorado that eliminates our ability to use parent company guarantees and requires proof of an end date for water treatment as a condition of permit issuance authorizing mining operations with some exceptions for existing operations adoption of similar new environmental regulations or more stringent application of existing 

regulations may materially increase our costs threaten certain operating activities and constrain our expansion opportunities 

our mining operations are subject to regulations under the endangered species act esa that are intended to protect species listed by the department of interior’s fish  wildlife service fws as endangered or threatened along with critical habitat designated by fws for these listed species the regulations limit the ability of landowners including us to obtain federal permits or authorizations needed for expansion of our operations and may also affect our ability to obtain retain or deliver water to some operations on august 27 2019 fws published final rules that mitigate but do not eliminate potential regulatory constraints on mining operations under the esa fws is also evaluating whether certain species should still be listed under the esa and reconsidering critical habitat that was proposed but never finalized environmental groups have aggressively challenged fws’s regulatory reforms no assurances can be made that restrictions relating to conservation will not have an adverse impact on expansion of our operations or not result in delays in project development constraints on exploration and constraints on operations in impacted areas 

we incurred environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs including our joint venture partners’ shares to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect our operations totaling 04 billion in both 2019 and 2018 and 05 billion in 2017 for 2020  we expect to incur approximately 05 billion of aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs the timing and amounts of estimated payments could change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements changes in scope and costs of reclamation and plug and abandonment activities the settlement of environmental matters and the rate at which actual spending occurs on continuing matters 

we incur significant costs for remediating environmental conditions on properties that have not been operated in many years 

fmc and its subsidiaries and many of their affiliates and predecessor companies have been involved in exploration mining milling smelting and manufacturing in the us for more than a century activities that occurred in the late 19th century and the 20th century prior to the advent of modern environmental laws were not subject to environmental regulation and were conducted before american industrial companies fully understood the longterm effects of their operations on the surrounding environment 

with the passage of cercla in 1980 companies like fmc became legally responsible for remediating hazardous substances released into the environment from properties owned or operated by them as well as properties where they arranged for disposal of such substances irrespective of when the release to the environment occurred or who caused it that liability is often asserted on a joint and several basis with other prior and subsequent owners operators and arrangers meaning that each owner or operator of the property is and each arranger may be held fully responsible for the remediation although in many cases some or all of the other responsible parties no longer exist do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found as a result because of our acquisition of fmc in 2007 many of the subsidiary companies we now own are potentially responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the us and we expect to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those remediation issues we are also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources at december 31 2019  we had more than 100 active remediation projects in 24 us states in addition fmc and certain affiliates and predecessor companies were parties to agreements relating to the transfer of businesses or properties that contained indemnification provisions relating to environmental matters and from time to time these provisions become the source of claims against us 

at december 31 2019  we had 16 billion recorded in our consolidated balance sheet for environmental obligations attributable to cercla or analogous state programs and for estimated future costs associated with environmental matters at closed facilities or closed portions of operating facilities 

our environmental obligation estimates are primarily based upon 

 

 

 

significant adjustments to these estimates are likely to occur in the future as additional information becomes available the actual environmental costs may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs and any such changes could be material 

in addition remediation standards imposed by epa and state environmental agencies have generally become more stringent over time and may become even more stringent in the future imposition of more stringent remediation standards particularly for arsenic and lead in soils poses a risk that additional remediation work could be required at our active remediation sites and at sites that we have already remediated to the satisfaction of the responsible governmental agencies and may increase the risk of toxic tort litigation 

epa is considering how to reduce lead exposure in the environment under multiple environmental programs certain federal and state health agencies also support lower lead cleanup levels the timing for these epa activities is unclear but any reduction in lead cleanup levels could result in material increases to our environmental reserves for ongoing residential property cleanup projects near former smelter sites 

refer to note 12 for further discussion of our environmental obligations 

our indonesia mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges and future changes in environmental laws or unanticipated environmental impacts from those operations could require us to incur increased costs 

mining operations on the scale of our indonesia operations involve significant environmental risks and challenges our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of crushed and ground rock material called tailings that results from the process by which we physically separate the copper gold and silverbearing materials from the ore that we mine in 2019 ptfi produced approximately 39 million metric tons of tailings our tailings management plan which has been approved by the indonesia government uses the unnavigable river system in the highlands near our mine to transport the tailings to an engineered area in the lowlands where the tailings and natural sediments are managed in a deposition area lateral levees have been constructed to help contain the footprint of the tailings and to limit their impact in the lowlands 

another major environmental challenge is managing overburden which is the rock that must be moved aside in the mining process to reach the ore in the presence of air water and naturally occurring bacteria some overburden can generate acid rock drainage or acidic water containing dissolved metals that if not properly managed can adversely affect the environment in addition certain overburden stockpiles are subject to erosion caused by the large amounts of rainfall with the eroded stockpile material eventually being deposited in the lowlands tailings management area this additional material influences the deposition of finer sediment material in the estuary as well as presents the potential for increased environmental impacts the grasberg overburden stockpiles have experienced significant erosion  exacerbated by unanticipated work stoppages that adversely affected our ability to manage certain overburden stockpiles which may have resulted in adverse environmental impacts the current tailings deposition management plan as well as environmental monitoring programs take into account the presence of this overburden in the lowlands tailings management area as part of this effort ptfi has expanded the scope of its studies and analysis to assess the environmental impacts from the overburden erosion including conducting risk assessments to determine whether any such impacts require additional monitoring or mitigation measures which would result in increased costs 

in the past certain indonesia government officials have raised questions with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans including a suggestion that we implement a pipeline system rather than the river transport system for tailings management and disposition because our indonesia mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area a pipeline system would be costly difficult to construct and maintain and more prone to catastrophic failure and could therefore involve significant potentially adverse environmental issues based on our own studies and others conducted by third parties we do not believe that a pipeline system is necessary or practical 

we cannot guarantee that we will not have overtopping or levee failure caused by extreme weather events or unanticipated structural failure in the future which could result in flooding of the nearby communities if flooding were to occur it could result in loss of lives severe personal property and environmental damages which could necessitate evacuation or relocation of communities or other emergency action financial assistance to the communities impacted remediation costs to repair and compensate for the social cultural and economic impacts 

in december 2018 indonesia’s ministry of environment and forestry the moef issued a revised environmental permit to ptfi to address many of the operational activities that it alleged were inconsistent with earlier studies ptfi and the moef also established a new framework for continuous improvement in environmental practices in ptfi’s operations including initiatives that ptfi will pursue to increase tailings retention and to evaluate large scale beneficial uses of tailings within indonesia in addition ptfi continues to work with moef to finalize environmental permitting related to the rail facilities and certain of the underground mining production operations as well as permitting for the extension of levees to contain the lateral flow of tailings in the lowlands refer to note 12 for further discussion 

we cannot assure you that future environmental changes affecting the mining industry in indonesia will not be introduced or unexpectedly altered or repealed or that new interpretations of existing environmental laws and regulations will not be issued which might have a significant impact on ptfi 

our copper mining operations require significant energy and regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change issues may increase our costs and adversely   affect our operations 

our copper mining operations require significant energy principally diesel electricity coal and natural gas most of which is obtained from third parties under longterm contracts energy represented approximately 20 percent of our copper mine site operating costs in 2019  and is expected to approximate 20 percent in 2020  

carbonbased energy is a significant input in our operations although haul truck diesel use and the amount of purchased power that is derived from fossil fuel or renewable sources varies significantly depending on site production and countryspecific circumstances the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would vary by operation based on particular geographic circumstances as a result of the paris agreement reached during the 21 st conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change in 2015 a number of governments have pledged “nationally determined contributions” to control and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the us several states including colorado and new mexico have advanced goals reducing or eliminating fossilfuel based energy production the administration of president trump has announced the intention of the us to withdraw from the paris agreement which begins a lengthy process that will not be completed until november 2020   transitions to renewable and other energy sources could among other things increase our operating and energy costs depending on the scope and magnitude of increased regulation of fossilfuel based energy production including greenhouse gas emissions 

other risks 

our holding company structure may impact our ability to service debt and our stockholders ’ ability to receive dividends  

we are a holding company with no material assets other than the capital stock and intercompany receivables of our subsidiaries as a result our ability to repay our indebtedness and pay dividends is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend loan debt repayment or otherwise our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to make funds available to us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends dividends from subsidiaries that are not wholly owned are shared with other equity owners cash at our international operations is also typically subject to foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation into the us 

in addition our subsidiaries may not be able to or be permitted to make distributions to us or repay loans to us to enable us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal restrictions as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries certain of our subsidiaries are parties to credit agreements that restrict their ability to make distributions or loan repayments to us if such subsidiary is in default under such agreements or to transfer substantially all of the assets of such subsidiary without the consent of the lenders 

our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries’ assets upon their liquidation reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries’ creditors including any trade creditors 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult these provisions 

 

 

 

 

these provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by the board 

in addition because we are incorporated in delaware we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with or acquisition of us 

these provisions may deter an acquisition of us that might otherwise be attractive to our stockholders 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

not applicable 







 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in numerous legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business or are associated with environmental issues we are also involved periodically in reviews inquiries investigations and other proceedings initiated by or involving government agencies some of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief management does not believe based on currently available information that the outcome of any legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition although individual or cumulative outcomes could be material to our operating results for a particular period depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period 

below is a discussion of our material legal proceedings not otherwise required to be disclosed in note 12 refer to note 12 for discussion of additional material legal proceedings 

water rights adjudications 

our operations in the western united states us require significant secure quantities of water for mining and ore processing activities and related support facilities continuous operation of our mines is dependent on among other things our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies in the arid western us where certain of our mines are located water rights are often contested and disputes over water rights are generally timeconsuming expensive and not necessarily dispositive unless they resolve both actual and potential claims the loss of a water right or a currently available water supply could force us to curtail operations or force premature closures thereby increasing andor accelerating costs or foregoing profitable operations 

at our north america operations certain of our water supplies are supported by surface water rights which give us the right to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location in arizona where our operations use both surface and groundwater we are a participant in an active general stream adjudication in which arizona courts have been attempting for over 40 years to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for the gila river one of the state’s largest river systems this stream adjudication primarily affects our morenci safford and sierrita mines the adjudication is addressing the state law claims of thousands of competing users including us as well as significant federal water claims that are potentially adverse to the state law claims of both surface water and groundwater users groundwater is treated differently from surface water under arizona law which historically allowed land owners to pump unlimited quantities of subsurface water subject only to the requirement of putting it to “reasonable use” however court decisions in the adjudication have concluded that some underground water constitutes “subflow” that is to be treated legally as surface water and is therefore subject to the arizona doctrine of prior appropriation and to the adjudication and potentially unavailable to groundwater pumpers in the absence of valid surface water claims any recharacterization of groundwater as surface water could affect the ability of consumers farmers ranchers municipalities and industrial users like us to continue to access water supplies that have been relied on for decades because we are a user of both groundwater and surface water in arizona we are an active participant in the adjudication proceeding 

in re the general adjudication of all rights to use water in the gila river system and sources  maricopa county superior court cause nos w1 salt w2 verde w3 upper gila and w4 san pedro this case was originally initiated in 1974 with the filing of a petition with the arizona state land department and was consolidated and transferred to the maricopa county superior court in 1981 the principal parties in addition to us include the state of arizona the gila valley irrigation district the franklin irrigation district the san carlos irrigation and drainage district the salt river project the san carlos apache tribe the gila river indian community and the us on behalf of those tribes on its own behalf and on behalf of the white mountain apache tribe the fort mcdowell mohaveapache indian community the salt river pimamaricopa indian community and the payson community of yavapai apache indians 

prior to january 1 1983 various indian tribes filed suits in the us district court in arizona claiming superior rights to water being used by many other parties including us and claiming damages for prior use in derogation of their allegedly superior rights these federal proceedings have been stayed pending the arizona superior court adjudications and some have been settled 

in 2005 the maricopa county superior court directed the arizona department of water resources adwr to prepare detailed recommendations regarding the delineation of the “subflow” zone of the san pedro river a tributary of the gila river underground water within the subflow zone is presumed to constitute appropriable subflow rather than groundwater although we have minimal interests in the san pedro river basin a decision that recharacterizes groundwater in that basin as appropriable surface water may set a precedent for other river systems in arizona that could have material implications for many commercial industrial municipal and agricultural users of groundwater including our arizona operations in 2017 the court approved adwr’s proposed subflow zone delineation no party has appealed that decision 

in 2014 adwr submitted a proposal for the development of procedures for “cone of depression” analyses to determine whether a well located outside of the subflow zone creates a cone of depression that intersects the subflow zone based on the cone of depression analyses wells outside of the subflow zone could be subject to the jurisdiction of the adjudication court in the absence of a valid surface water claim to support the pumping owners of wells deemed to be depleting the subflow zone through their cones of depression may be subject to claims that they must refrain from pumping or must pay damages in january 2017 adwr issued a report containing its 

recommended cone of depression test and a trial was held in march 2018 concerning adwr’s recommended action 

on november 14 2018 the court’s special master issued a final decision rejecting adwr’s recommended test instead adopting our position that a numeric model capable of accounting for complexities of the aquifer system should be used the special master also confirmed that this initial cone of depression test is for determining which wells are subject to the jurisdiction of the adjudication court not proving that a well is pumping subflow or establishing how much of a well’s production is subflow those matters will be determined by a subsequent “subflow depletion test” which has not yet been formulated some of our adversaries objected to the special master’s final decision and the adjudication court heard oral argument on the objections in february 2020 

in december 2018 adwr submitted its initial report on the “subflow depletion test” which will specify the methodology a well owner must use to quantify the portion of the water drawn from a well that is subflow as opposed to groundwater adwr remains in the process of developing its proposed subflow depletion test we along with the other parties will have the opportunity to provide input during the process and object to the proposal when it is submitted by adwr 

as part of the gila river adjudication the us has asserted numerous claims for express and implied “reserved” surface water and groundwater rights on indian and nonindian federal lands throughout arizona these claims are related to reservations of federal land for specific purposes  eg  indian reservations national parks military bases and wilderness areas unlike state lawbased water rights federal reserved water rights are given priority in the prior appropriation system based on the date the land was reserved not the date that water was first used on the land in addition federal reserved water rights if recognized by the court may enjoy greater protection from groundwater pumping than is accorded to state lawbased water rights 

in multiple instances the us asserts a right to all water in a particular watershed that was not effectively appropriated under state law prior to the establishment of the federal reservation this creates risks for both surface water users and groundwater users because such expansive claims may severely impede competing uses of water within the same watershed because there are numerous federal reservations in watersheds across arizona the reserved water right claims of the us pose a significant risk to multiple operations including morenci and safford in the upper gila river watershed and sierrita in the santa cruz watershed because federal reserved water rights may adversely affect water uses at each of these operations we have been actively involved in litigation over these claims because federal reserved water rights have not yet been quantified the task of determining how much water each federal reservation may use has been left to the gila river adjudication court several “contested cases” to quantify reserved water rights for particular federal reservations in arizona are currently pending in the adjudication and one was recently resolved that case in re aravaipa canyon wilderness area was to resolve the us’s claims to water for the aravaipa canyon wilderness area the case was tried in 2015 and the court issued a decision in december 2018 supportive of our position on almost all issues including rejection of the government’s core argument that wilderness areas are entitled to all water that was not appropriated at the time the reservation was created we believe the rulings in this case will support our positions in other pending federal reserved right cases including these in re fort huachuca  which involves the us’s claims to water for an arizona army base and is awaiting a decision following a trial which concluded in february 2017 in re redfield canyon wilderness area  which involves the us’s claims to water for another wilderness area and is awaiting a decision following a trial which concluded in may 2017 and in re san pedro riparian national conservation area  which involves the us’s claims to water for a national conservation area and is awaiting a decision following a trial which concluded in may 2018 

given the legal and technical complexity of these adjudications their long history and their longterm legal economic and political implications it is difficult to predict the timing or the outcome of these proceedings if we are not able to satisfactorily resolve the issues being addressed in the adjudications our ability to pump groundwater could be diminished or curtailed and our operations at morenci safford and sierrita could be adversely affected unless we are able to acquire alternative resources

general 

we are a leading international mining company with headquarters in phoenix arizona our company was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware on november 10 1987 we operate large longlived geographically diverse assets with significant proven and probable reserves of copper gold and molybdenum and we are the world’s largest publicly traded copper producer our portfolio of assets includes the grasberg minerals district in indonesia one of the world’s largest copper and gold deposits and significant mining operations in the americas including the largescale morenci minerals district in north america and the cerro verde operation in south america 

we believe that we have a highquality portfolio of longlived copper assets positioned to generate longterm value we have commenced a project to develop the lone star oxide ores near the safford operation in eastern arizona and pt freeport indonesia ptfi has several projects in the grasberg minerals district related to the development of its largescale longlived highgrade underground ore bodies we are also pursuing other opportunities to enhance our mines’ net present values and we continue to advance studies for future development of our copper resources the timing of which will be dependent on market conditions 

on december 21 2018 we completed the transaction with the indonesian government regarding ptfi’s longterm mining rights and share ownership we expect our share of future cash flows of the expanded ptfi asset base combined with the cash proceeds received in the transaction to be comparable to our share of anticipated future cash flows under ptfi’s former contract of work cow and joint venture arrangements with rio tinto plc rio tinto joint venture 

as a result of the transaction pt indonesia asahan aluminium’s persero pt inalum an indonesian stateowned enterprise and pt indonesia papua metal dan mineral’s pti  formerly known as pt indocopper investama collective share ownership of ptfi totals 5124 percent and our share ownership is 4876 percent the arrangements provide for us and the other pretransaction ptfi shareholders to retain the economics of the revenue and cost sharing arrangements under the former rio tinto joint venture as a result our economic interest in ptfi including our share of ptfis net income is expected to approximate 81 percent from 2019 through 2022 refer to note 2 for further discussion of the ptfi divestment transaction 

we ptfi pti and pt inalum also entered into a shareholders agreement at closing which includes provisions related to the governance and management of ptfi and establishes our control over the management of ptfis operations concurrent with closing the transaction the indonesian government granted ptfi a new special mining license iupk to replace its former cow enabling ptfi to conduct operations in the grasberg minerals district through 2041 under the terms of the iupk ptfi has been granted an extension of mining rights through 2031 with rights to extend mining rights through 2041 subject to ptfi completing the construction of a new smelter in indonesia within five years of closing the transaction and fulfilling its defined fiscal obligations to the indonesian government refer to note 13 and item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion of ptfi’s iupk 

during the three years ended december 31 2018 we have taken actions to restore our balance sheet strength through a combination of asset sale and capital market transactions which primarily occurred during 2016 refer to notes 2 and 10 for further discussion of these transactions these actions combined with cash flow from operations resulted in net reductions of debt totaling 93 billion during the three years ended december 31 2018

copper gold and molybdenum 

following is a brief discussion of our primary natural resources – copper gold and molybdenum for further discussion of historical and current market prices of these commodities refer to mda and item 1a “risk factors” 

copper 

copper is an internationally traded commodity and its prices are determined by the major metals exchanges – the london metal exchange lme new york mercantile exchange nymex and shanghai futures exchange prices on these exchanges generally reflect the worldwide balance of copper supply and demand and can be volatile and cyclical during 2018  the lme copper settlement price averaged 296  per pound ranging from a low of 264  per pound to a high of 329  per pound and was 271  per pound at december 31 2018  

in general demand for copper reflects the rate of underlying world economic growth particularly in industrial production and construction according to wood mackenzie a widely followed independent metals market consultant copper’s enduse markets and their estimated shares of total consumption are construction 30 percent consumer products 25 percent electrical applications 24 percent transportation 11 percent and industrial machinery 10 percent we believe copper will continue to be essential in these basic uses as well as contribute significantly to new technologies for energy efficiencies to advance communications and to enhance public health examples of areas we believe will require additional copper in the future include i high efficiency motors which consume up to 75 percent more copper than a standard motor ii electric vehicles which consume up to four times the amount of copper in terms of weight compared to vehicles of similar size with an internal combustion engine and require copperintensive charging station infrastructure to refuel and iii renewable energy such as wind and solar which consume four to five times the amount of copper compared to traditional fossil fuel generated power

gold 

gold is used for jewelry coinage and bullion as well as various industrial and electronic applications gold can be readily sold on numerous markets throughout the world benchmark prices are generally based on london bullion market association london quotations during 2018  the london pm gold price averaged 1268  per ounce ranging from a low of 1178  per ounce to a high of 1355  per ounce and was 1279  per ounce on december 28 2018 there was no london pm gold price quote on december 31 2018  

molybdenum 

molybdenum is a key alloying element in steel and the raw material for several chemicalgrade products used in catalysts lubrication smoke suppression corrosion inhibition and pigmentation molybdenum as a highpurity metal is also used in electronics such as flatpanel displays and in super alloys used in aerospace reference prices for molybdenum are available in several publications including metals week cru report and  metal bulletin  during 2018  the weekly average price of molybdenum quoted by metals week  averaged 1193  per pound ranging from a low of 1067  per pound to a high of 1297  per pound and was 1188  per pound at december 31 2018  

products and sales 

our consolidated revenues for 2018  primarily included sales of copper  75 percent  gold  17 percent  and molybdenum  6 percent  copper concentrate sales to pt smelting ptfi’s 25percentowned copper smelter and refinery in indonesia totaled 12 percent  of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017 which is the only customer that accounted for 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues during the three years ended december 31 2018  refer to note 16  for a summary of our consolidated revenues and operating income loss by business segment and geographic area 

copper products 

we are one of the world’s leading producers of copper concentrate cathode and continuous cast copper rod during 2018  59 percent  of our mined copper was sold in concentrate 21 percent  as cathode and 20 percent  as rod from our north america operations the copper ore from our mines is generally processed either by smelting and refining or by solution extraction and electrowinning sxew as described below 

copper concentrate  we produce copper concentrate at six of our mines in which mined ore is crushed and treated to produce a copper concentrate with copper content of approximately 20 to 30 percent in north america copper concentrate is produced at the morenci bagdad sierrita and chino mines and a significant portion is shipped to our miami smelter in arizona for further processing copper concentrate is also produced at the cerro verde mine in peru and the grasberg minerals district in indonesia 

copper cathode  we produce copper cathode at our electrolytic refinery located in el paso texas and at nine of our mines 

sxew cathode is produced from the morenci bagdad safford sierrita miami chino and tyrone mines in north america and from the cerro verde and el abra mines in south america  for ore subject to the sxew process the ore is placed on stockpiles and copper is extracted from the ore by dissolving it with a weak sulphuric acid solution the copper content of the solution is increased in two additional sx stages and then the copperbearing solution undergoes an ew process to produce cathode that is on average 9999 percent copper our copper cathode is used as the raw material input for copper rod brass mill products and for other uses 

copper cathode is also produced at atlantic copper our wholly owned copper smelting and refining unit in spain and pt smelting copper concentrate is smelted  ie  subjected to extreme heat to produce copper anode which weighs between 800 and 900 pounds and has an average copper content of 995 percent the anode is further treated by electrolytic refining to produce copper cathode which weighs between 100 and 350 pounds and has an average copper content of 9999 percent refer to “mining operations  smelting facilities and other mining properties” for further discussion of atlantic copper and pt smelting 

continuous cast copper rod  we manufacture continuous cast copper rod at our facilities in el paso texas norwich connecticut and miami arizona primarily using copper cathode produced at our north america copper mines

copper sales 

north america  the majority of the copper produced at our north america copper mines and refined in our el paso texas refinery is consumed at our rod plants to produce copper rod which is sold to wire and cable manufacturers the remainder of our north america copper production is sold in the form of copper cathode or copper concentrate under us dollardenominated annual contracts cathode and rod contract prices are generally based on the prevailing commodity exchange inc comex  a division of nymex monthly average settlement price for the month of shipment and include a premium generally copper cathode is sold to rod brass or tube fabricators during 2018  17 percent of our north america mines’ copper concentrate sales volumes were shipped to atlantic copper for smelting and refining and sold as copper anode and copper cathode 

south america    production from our south america mines is sold as copper concentrate or copper cathode under us dollardenominated annual and multiyear contracts during 2018  our south america mines sold approximately 77 percent of their copper production in concentrate and 23 percent as cathode 

substantially all of south america’s copper concentrate and cathode sales contracts provide final copper pricing in a specified future month generally one to four months from the shipment date primarily based on quoted lme monthly average settlement copper prices revenues from south america’s concentrate sales are recorded net of royalties and treatment charges  ie  fees paid to smelters that are generally negotiated annually in addition because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrate is unrecoverable from the smelting process revenues from south america’s concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances for unrecoverable metals which are a negotiated term of the contracts and vary by customer 

indonesia    ptfi sells its production in the form of copper concentrate which contains significant quantities of gold and silver primarily under us dollardenominated longterm contracts ptfi also sells a small amount of copper concentrate in the spot market following is a summary of ptfi’s aggregate percentage of concentrate sales to unaffiliated third parties pt smelting and atlantic copper for the years ended december 31 



substantially all of ptfi’s concentrate sales contracts provide final copper pricing in a specified future month generally one to four months from the shipment date primarily based on quoted lme monthly average settlement copper prices revenues from ptfi’s concentrate sales are recorded net of royalties export duties treatment charges and allowances for unrecoverable metals 

gold products and sales 

we produce gold almost exclusively from the grasberg minerals district gold is primarily sold as a component of our copper concentrate or in slimes which are a product of the smelting and refining process at atlantic copper gold generally is priced at the average london price for a specified month near the month of shipment revenues from gold sold as a component of our copper concentrate are recorded net of treatment and refining charges royalties export duties and allowances for unrecoverable metals revenues from gold sold in slimes are recorded net of refining charges 

molybdenum products and sales 

we are the world’s largest producer of molybdenum and molybdenumbased chemicals in addition to production from the henderson and climax molybdenum mines we produce molybdenum concentrate at certain of the north america copper mines and the cerro verde copper mine in peru the majority of our molybdenum concentrate is processed in our own conversion facilities our molybdenum sales are primarily priced based on the average published metals week price for the month prior to the month of shipment

arbitration refer to note 13 and item 1a “risk factors” for discussion of ptfi’s iupk and risks associated with our indonesia mining operations 

ptfi has applied for a oneyear extension of its export license which currently expires on february 16 2019 export licenses are valid for one year periods subject to review and approval by the indonesian government every six months depending on smelter construction progress 

grasberg minerals district  ptfi operates in the remote highlands of the sudirman mountain range in the province of papua indonesia which is on the western half of the island of new guinea since 1967 we and our predecessors have been the only operator of exploration and mining activities in the approximately 24600acre operating area 

the grasberg minerals district has three operating mines the grasberg open pit the deep ore zone doz underground mine and the big gossan underground mine in september 2015 ptfi initiated precommercial production which represents ore extracted during the development phase for the purpose of obtaining access to the ore body at the deep mill level zone dmlz underground mine 

as further discussed in mda ptfi continues to advance several projects in the grasberg minerals district related to the development of its largescale longlived highgrade underground ore bodies located beneath and nearby the grasberg open pit in aggregate these underground ore bodies are expected to produce largescale quantities of copper and gold following the transition from the grasberg open pit operations where ptfi is currently mining the final phase refer to item 1a “risk factors” for discussion of risks associated with development projects and underground mines 

substantial progress has been made to prepare for the transition to mining of the grasberg block cave gbc underground mine first undercut blasting occurred in september 2018 first drawbell blasting occurred in december 2018 and cave production is scheduled for the first half of 2019 all underground mining levels and the ore flow system are being commissioned as ptfi transitions mining from the open pit to underground its production is expected to be significantly lower in 2019 and 2020 compared to 2018 metal production is expected to improve significantly by 2021 following a rampup period gbc production rates over the next five years are expected to ramp up to 130000 metric tons of ore per day 

ptfi’s production including the former rio tinto joint venture share totaled 12 billion  pounds of copper and 27 million  ounces of gold in 2018  10 billion  pounds of copper and 16 million  ounces of gold in 2017  and 11 billion  pounds of copper and 11 million  ounces of gold in 2016  

our principal source of power for all of our indonesia operations is a coalfired power plant that we built in 1998 diesel generators supply peaking and backup electrical power generating capacity a combination of naturally occurring mountain streams and water derived from our underground operations provides water for our operations our indonesian operations are in an active seismic zone and experience average annual rainfall of approximately 200 inches 

grasberg open pit 

ptfi began openpit mining of the grasberg ore body in 1990 ptfi is currently mining the final phase of the grasberg open pit and expects to transition to the gbc in the first half of 2019 

production from the ore stockpiles which are located outside of the pit limits is expected to continue through the end of 2019 production in the open pit is currently at the 3265 to 3055meter elevation level and totaled 49 million metric tons of ore in 2018  which provided 75 percent of ptfi’s 2018  mill feed 

the current openpit equipment fleet consists of over 500 units the larger mining equipment directly associated with production includes an available fleet of 99 haul trucks with payloads of 200 metric tons and 15 shovels with bucket sizes ranging from 17 to 42 cubic meters which are capable of moving an average of 275000 metric tons of material per day

doz underground mine 

the doz ore body lies vertically below the now depleted intermediate ore zone ptfi began production from the doz ore body in 1989 using openstope mining methods but suspended production in 1991 in favor of production from the grasberg open pit production resumed in 2000 using the blockcave method and is at the 3110meter elevation level 

the doz is a mature blockcave mine that previously operated at 80000 metric tons of ore per day current operating rates from the doz underground mine are driven by the value of the incremental doz ore grade compared to the ore from the grasberg open pit and ore grade material from the development of the dmlz and gbc underground mines ore milled from the doz underground mine averaged 33800  metric tons of ore per day in 2018 31200  metric tons of ore per day in 2017 and 38000  metric tons of ore per day in 2016 production at the doz underground mine is expected to continue through 2022 

the doz mine fleet consists of 154 pieces of mobile equipment the primary mining equipment directly associated with production and development includes an available fleet of 44 lhd units and 20 haul trucks each production lhd unit typically carries approximately 11 metric tons of ore using ore passes and chutes the lhd units transfer ore into 55 to 60 metric ton capacity haul trucks the trucks dump into two gyratory crushers and the ore is then conveyed to the surface stockpiles for processing 

big gossan underground mine 

the big gossan mine lies underground and adjacent to the current mill site it is a tabular near vertical ore body with approximate dimensions of 1200 meters along strike and 800 meters down dip with varying thicknesses from 20 meters to 120 meters the mine utilizes a blasthole stoping method with delayed paste backfill stopes of varying sizes are mined and the ore dropped down passes to a truck haulage level trucks are chute loaded and transport the ore to a jaw crusher the crushed ore is then hoisted vertically via a twoskip production shaft to a level where it is loaded onto a conveyor belt the belt carries the ore to one of the main underground conveyors where the ore is transferred and conveyed to the surface stockpiles for processing 

ore milled from the big gossan underground mine averaged 3800 metric tons per day in 2018 600 metric tons per day in 2017 and 900 metric tons per day in 2016 production at the big gossan underground mine is expected to continue through 2041 

the big gossan mine fleet consists of over 78 pieces of mobile equipment which includes 13 lhd units and 10 haul trucks used in development and production activities 

dmlz underground mine 

the dmlz ore body lies below the doz underground mine at the 2590meter elevation and represents the downward continuation of mineralization in the ertsberg east skarn system and neighboring ertsberg porphyry 

during thirdquarter 2018 ptfi commenced hydraulic fracturing activities to manage rock stresses and 

precondition the dmlz underground mine for largescale production following mining induced seismic activity experienced in 2017 and 2018 results to date have been effective in managing rock stresses and preconditioning the cave ptfi expects to commence the rampup of production in the dmlz underground mine by mid2019 and to reach full production rates of 80000 metric tons per day in 2022 estimates of timing of future production continue to be reviewed and may be modified as additional information becomes available production at the dmlz underground mine is expected to continue through 2041 

ore milled from the dmlz underground mine averaged 3200  metric tons of ore per day in both 2018  and 2017 and 4400  metric tons per day in 2016 

the dmlz mine fleet consists of over 240 pieces of mobile equipment which includes 25 lhd units and 14 haul trucks used in production and development activities 

description of indonesia ore bodies   our indonesia ore bodies are located within and around two main igneous intrusions the grasberg monzodiorite and the ertsberg diorite the host rocks of these ore bodies include both carbonate and clastic rocks that form the ridge crests and upper flanks of the sudirman range and the igneous rocks of monzonitic to dioritic composition that intrude them the igneoushosted ore bodies the grasberg open pit and gbc and portions of the doz occur as vein stockworks and disseminations of copper sulfides dominated by chalcopyrite and to a lesser extent bornite the sedimentaryrock hosted ore bodies portions of the doz and all of 

 18 

the big gossan occur as “magnetiterich calciummagnesian skarn” replacements whose location and orientation are strongly influenced by major faults and by the chemistry of the carbonate rocks along the margins of the intrusions 

the copper mineralization in these skarn deposits is dominated by chalcopyrite but higher bornite concentrations are common moreover gold occurs in significant concentrations in all of the district’s ore bodies though rarely visible to the naked eye these gold concentrations usually occur as inclusions within the copper sulfide minerals though in some deposits these concentrations can also be strongly associated with pyrite 

the following diagram indicates the relative elevations in meters of our reported indonesia ore bodies 

the following map which encompasses an area of 42 square kilometers 16 square miles indicates the relative positions and sizes of our reported indonesia ore bodies and their locations

smelting facilities and other mining properties 

atlantic copper  our wholly owned atlantic copper smelter and refinery is located on land concessions from the huelva spain port authorities which are scheduled to expire in 2039 

the design capacity of the smelter is approximately 300000 metric tons of copper per year and the refinery has a capacity of 286000 metric tons of copper per year atlantic copper produced 295300 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 283100 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2018  283100 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 271400 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2017 and 296900 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 285800 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2016 

following is a summary of atlantic copper’s concentrate purchases from unaffiliated third parties and our copper mining operations for the years ended december 31 



atlantic copper’s major maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately every eight years with shorterterm maintenance turnarounds in the interim atlantic copper completed a 79day major maintenance turnaround in 2013 a 16day maintenance turnaround in 2015 and a 27day maintenance turnaround in 2017 a 15day maintenance turnaround is scheduled for thirdquarter 2019 

pt smelting  ptfi’s former cow required us to construct or cause to be constructed a smelter in indonesia if we and the indonesian government determined that such a project would be economically viable in 1995 following the completion of a feasibility study we entered into agreements relating to the formation of pt smelting an indonesian company and the construction of the copper smelter and refinery in gresik indonesia pt smelting owns and operates the smelter and refinery ptfi owns 25 percent of pt smelting with the remainder owned by mitsubishi materials corporation 605 percent mitsubishi corporation rtm japan ltd 95 percent and jx nippon mining  metals corporation 5 percent 

ptfi’s contract with pt smelting requires ptfi to supply 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements at market rates subject to a minimum or maximum treatment charge rate necessary for pt smelting to produce 205000 metric tons of copper annually on a priority basis ptfi may also sell copper concentrate to pt smelting at market rates for quantities in excess of 205000 metric tons of copper annually ptfi supplied 90 percent  of pt smelting’s concentrate requirements in 2018 93 percent  in 2017 and 88 percent  in 2016 

in early 2017 the indonesian government issued new regulations to address exports of unrefined metals including copper concentrate and anode slimes and other matters related to the mining sector these regulations permit the export of anode slimes which is necessary for pt smelting to continue operating as a result of labor disturbances and a delay in the renewal of its export license for anode slimes pt smelting’s operations were shut down from midjanuary 2017 until early march 2017 pt smelting has applied for a oneyear extension of its anode slimes export license which currently expires february 26 2019 

pt smelting produced 258800 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 257600 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2018  245800 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 247800 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2017 and 255700 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 241700 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2016 

pt smelting’s maintenance turnarounds which range from two weeks to a month to complete typically are expected to occur approximately every two years with shortterm maintenance turnarounds in the interim the next major maintenance turnaround is scheduled for 2020 pt smelting completed a 25day maintenance turnaround during 2016 and a 30day maintenance turnaround during 2018 in addition to pt smelting’s scheduled annual maintenance in november 2018 pt smelting also experienced downtime in december 2018 caused by unscheduled maintenance at its solesource oxygen supplier this resulted in a temporary shutdown of pt smelting’s operations in december 2018

we have several projects and potential opportunities to expand production volumes extend mine lives and develop largescale underground ore bodies as further discussed in mda our nearterm major development projects primarily include the underground development activities in the grasberg minerals district and development of the lone star oxide project considering the longterm nature and large size of our development projects actual costs and timing could vary from estimates additionally in response to market conditions the timing of our expenditures will continue to be reviewed we continue to review our mine development and processing plans to maximize the value of our mineral reserves 

we also have an additional longterm underground mine development project in the grasberg minerals district for the kucing liar ore body which lies on the southern flank of and underneath the southern portion of the grasberg open pit at the 2605meter elevation level we expect to mine the kucing liar ore body using the blockcave method aggregate capital cost estimates for development of the kucing liar ore body are projected to approximate 38 billion which are expected to be made between 2020 and 2032 additionally our current mine development plans include approximately 60 billion of capital expenditures at our processing facilities to optimize the handling of underground ore types once the grasberg openpit operations cease we expect substantially all of these expenditures to be made between 2019 and 2034 the timing and development of this project is currently being reviewed 

our mining exploration activities are generally associated with our existing mines focusing on opportunities to expand reserves and resources to support development of additional future production capacity exploration results continue to indicate opportunities for significant future potential reserve additions in north america and south america exploration spending associated with mining operations totaled 78 million  in 2018  72 million in 2017  and 44 million in 2016  refer to mda for projected exploration expenditures for the year 2019 

refer to item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion of risks associated with mine development projects and exploration activities and of risks associated with ptfi’s iupk 

sources and availability of energy natural resources and raw materials 

our copper mining operations require significant energy principally diesel electricity coal and natural gas most of which is obtained from third parties under longterm contracts energy represented approximately 20 percent  of our copper mine site operating costs in 2018  including purchases of approximately 220 million  gallons of diesel fuel 8150  gigawatt hours of electricity at our north america and south america copper mining operations we generate all of our power at our indonesia mining operation 740 thousand  metric tons of coal for our coal power plant in indonesia and 1  million mmbtu million british thermal units of natural gas at certain of our north america mines based on current cost estimates energy will approximate 20 percent  of our copper mine site operating costs in 2019  

our mining operations also require significant quantities of water for mining ore processing and related support facilities the loss of water rights for any of our mines in whole or in part or shortages of water to which we have rights could require us to curtail or shut down mining operations for a further discussion of risks and legal proceedings associated with the availability of water refer to item 1a “risk factors” and item 3 “legal proceedings” 

sulphuric acid is used in the sxew process and is produced as a byproduct of the smelting process at our smelters and from our sulfur burners at the safford mine sulphuric acid needs in excess of the sulphuric acid produced by our operations are purchased from third parties

community and human rights 

we have adopted policies that govern our working relationships with the communities where we operate and are designed to guide our practices and programs in a manner that respects human rights and the culture of the local people impacted by our operations we continue to make significant expenditures on community development education training and cultural programs which include 

 

in december 2000 we endorsed the joint us state departmentbritish foreign office voluntary principles on human rights and security voluntary principles we participated in developing these voluntary principles with other major natural resource companies and international human rights organizations and they are incorporated into our human rights policy the voluntary principles provide guidelines for our security programs including interaction with hostgovernment security personnel private security contractors and our internal security employees 

our human rights policy most recently updated in august 2017 reflects our full commitment to the united nations guiding principles on business and human rights we have embarked on a program to plan and conduct sitelevel human rights impact assessments hria at our global operations 

hrias help us to embed human rights considerations into our business practices including sitelevel sustainable development risk registers we completed a hria at our cerro verde operation in peru in 2017 and at our new mexico mining operations in 2018 we also participate in a multiindustry human rights working group to gain insight from peer companies we believe that our social and economic development programs are responsive to the issues raised by the local communities near our areas of operation and help us maintain good relations with the surrounding communities and avoid disruptions of mining operations as part of our ongoing commitment to sustainable community development we make significant investments in social programs including inkind support and administration across our global operations over the last three years these investments have averaged 150 million per year nevertheless social and political instability in the areas of our operations may adversely impact our mining operations refer to item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

south america  cerro verde has provided a variety of community support projects over the years following engagements with regional and local governments civic leaders and development agencies in 2006 cerro verde committed to support the costs for a new potable water treatment plant to serve arequipa in addition an agreement was reached with the peruvian government for development of a water storage network that was financed by cerro verde and a distribution network that was financed by the cerro verde civil association 

cerro verde reached an agreement with the regional government of arequipa the national government the local water utility company and other local institutions to allow it to finance engineer and construct a wastewater treatment plant for the city of arequipa which was completed in 2015 the wastewater treatment plant supplements existing water supplies to support cerro verde’s concentrator expansion and also improves the local water quality enhances agriculture products grown in the area and reduces the risk of waterborne illnesses in addition to these projects cerro verde annually makes significant community development investments in the arequipa region 

security matters  consistent with our operating permits in peru and our commitment to protect our employees and property we have taken steps to provide a safe and secure working environment as part of its security program cerro verde maintains its own internal security department both employees and contractors perform functions such as protecting company facilities monitoring shipments of supplies and products assisting in traffic control and aiding in emergency response operations the security department receives human rights and voluntary principles training annually some contractors assigned to protection of expatriate personnel are armed these contractors also receive training in defensive driving and firearms handling cerro verde’s costs for its internal civilian security department totaled 8 million in both 2018 and 2017 and 6 million in 2016 

 23 

cerro verde like all businesses and residents of peru relies on the peruvian government for the maintenance of public order upholding the rule of law and the protection of personnel and property the peruvian government is responsible for employing police personnel and directing their operations cerro verde has limited public security forces in support of its operation with the arrangement defined through a memorandum of understanding with the peruvian national police cerro verde’s share of support costs for governmentprovided security approximated 1 million in each of the years 2018 2017 and 2016 

indonesia  in 1996 ptfi established the freeport partnership fund for community development the partnership fund through which ptfi has made available funding and technical assistance to support community development initiatives in the areas of health education economic development and local infrastructure ptfi has committed through june 2019 to provide one percent of its annual revenue for the development of the local communities in its area of operations through the partnership fund ptfi recorded costs of 55 million  in 2018  44 million  in 2017  and 33 million  in 2016  for this commitment 

the amungme and kamoro community development organization  lembaga pengembangan masyarakat amungme dan kamoro  or lpmak oversees disbursement of the program funds we contribute to the partnership fund lpmak is governed by a board of commissioners and a board of directors which are comprised of representatives from the local amungme and kamoro tribal communities government leaders church leaders and one representative of ptfi on each board the amungme and kamoro people are original inhabitants of the land in our area of operations in addition to the partnership fund ptfi makes significant annual investments in public health education community infrastructure and local economic development 

security matters    consistent with our ongoing commitment to protect our employees and property we have taken steps to provide a safe and secure working environment as part of its security program ptfi maintains its own internal civilian security department both employees and contractors are unarmed and perform functions such as protecting company facilities monitoring shipments of supplies and products assisting in traffic control and aiding in emergency response operations the security department receives human rights training annually 

ptfi’s costs for its internal civilian security department totaled 59 million  in 2018  54 million  in 2017  and 58 million  in 2016  

ptfi like all businesses and residents of indonesia relies on the indonesian government for the maintenance of public order upholding the rule of law and protection of personnel and property the grasberg minerals district has been designated by the indonesian government as one of indonesia’s vital national assets this designation results in the police and to a lesser extent the military playing a significant role in protecting the area of our operations the indonesian government is responsible for employing police and military personnel and directing their operations 

from the outset of ptfi’s operations the indonesian government has looked to ptfi to provide logistical and infrastructure support and assistance for these necessary services because of the limited resources of the indonesian government and the remote location of and lack of development in papua ptfi’s financial support of the indonesian government security institutions assigned to ptfi’s operations area represents a prudent response to ptfi’s requirements and commitments to protect its workforce and property and better ensuring that personnel are properly fed and lodged and have the logistical resources to patrol ptfi’s roads and secure its area of operations in addition the provision of such support is consistent with our philosophy of responsible corporate citizenship and reflects our commitment to pursue practices that promote human rights 

ptfi’s support costs for the governmentprovided security totaled 27 million  in 2018  23 million  in 2017  and 20 million  in 2016  this supplemental support consists of various infrastructure and other costs including food housing fuel travel vehicle repairs allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs and community assistance programs conducted by the military and police

mining production and sales data

mineral reserves 

proven and probable reserves were determined by the use of mapping drilling sampling assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry as more fully discussed below the term “reserve” as used in the reserve data presented here means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination the term “proven reserves” means reserves for which i quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops trenches workings or drill holes ii grade andor quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and iii the sites for inspection sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established the term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced the degree of assurance although lower than that for proven reserves is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 

our mineral reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies we conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk we revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies refer to item 1a “risk factors” for discussion of risks associated with our estimates of proven and probable reserves 

estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves at december 31 2018  were determined using 250  per pound for copper in north america and south america and 200  per pound for copper in indonesia 1000  per ounce for gold and 10  per pound for molybdenum reserves for indonesia would not significantly change if assessed under a longterm price of 250 per pound of copper as ptfi’s reserve plan is millconstrained by the term of its iupk which contains rights to extend mining rights through 2041 

for the threeyear period ended december 31 2018  lme copper settlement prices averaged 265  per pound london pm gold prices averaged 1259  per ounce and the weekly average price for molybdenum quoted by metals week  averaged 885  per pound in late 2015 we incorporated changes in the commercial pricing structure for our molybdenumbased chemical products to enable continuation of chemicalgrade production 

the estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves presented in the table below represent the estimated metal quantities from which we expect to be paid after application of estimated metallurgical recovery rates and smelter recovery rates where applicable recoverable reserves are that part of a mineral deposit that we estimate can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination

the reserve table above and the tables on the following pages utilize the abbreviations described below

 29 

in defining our openpit reserves we apply a “variable cutoff grade” strategy the objective of this strategy is to maximize the net present value of our operations we use a “breakeven cutoff grade” to define the insitu reserves for our underground ore bodies the breakeven cutoff grade is defined for a metric ton of ore as that equivalent copper grade once produced and sold that generates sufficient revenue to cover all operating and administrative costs associated with our production 

our copper mines may contain other commercially recoverable metals such as gold molybdenum and silver we value all commercially recoverable metals in terms of a copper equivalent percentage to determine a single cutoff grade copper equivalent percentage is used to express the relative value of multimetal ores in terms of one metal the calculation expresses the relative value of the ore using estimates of contained metal quantities metals prices as used for reserve determination recovery rates treatment charges and royalties our molybdenum properties use a molybdenum cutoff grade 

the table below shows the minimum cutoff grade by process for each of our existing ore bodies as of december 31 2018  



 30 

drill hole spacing data is used by mining professionals such as geologists and geological engineers in determining the suitability of data coverage on a relative basis in a given deposit type and mining method scenario so as to achieve a given level of confidence in the resource estimate drill hole spacing is only one of several criteria necessary to establish resource classification drilling programs are typically designed to achieve an optimum sample spacing to support the level of confidence in results that apply to a particular stage of development of a mineral deposit 

the following table sets forth the average drill hole spacing based on average sample distance or drill pattern spacing for proven and probable ore reserves by process type 



 31 

production sequencing 

the following chart illustrates our current plans for sequencing and producing our proven and probable reserves at each of our ore bodies and the years in which we currently expect production from each ore body and related stockpiles our proven and probable ore reserves in indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041 and our current mine plan and planned operations are based on the assumption that ptfi will comply with its obligations under the iupk and receive the second 10year extension from 2031 through 2041 refer to item 1a “risk factors” and note 13 for further discussion production volumes are typically lower in the first few years for each ore body as development activities are ongoing and as the mine ramps up to full production and production volumes may also be lower as the mine reaches the end of its life the sequencing dates shown in the chart below include development activity that results in metal production the ultimate timing of the start of production from our undeveloped mines is dependent upon a number of factors including the results of our exploration and development efforts and may vary from the dates shown below in addition we develop our mine plans based on maximizing the net present value from the ore bodies significant additional capital expenditures will be required at many of these mines in order to achieve the lifeofmine plans reflected below 

mill and leach stockpiles 

mill and leach stockpiles generally contain lower grade ores that have been extracted from an ore body and are available for metal recovery mill stockpiles contain sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through milling concentrating smelting and refining or alternatively by concentrate leaching leach stockpiles contain oxide ores and certain secondary sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities 

because it is impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count reasonable estimation methods are employed the quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grades of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles 

 32 

expected copper recovery rates for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing the recoverable copper in mill stockpiles once entered into the production process can be produced into copper concentrate almost immediately 

expected copper recovery rates for leach stockpiles are determined using smallscale laboratory tests small to largescale column testing which simulates the production process historical trends and other factors including mineralogy of the ore and rock type total copper recovery in leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low percentage to more than 90 percent depending on several variables including processing methodology processing variables mineralogy and particle size of the rock for newly placed material on active stockpiles as much as 80 percent of total copper recovery may be extracted during the first year and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years processes and recovery rates are monitored regularly and recovery rate estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes 

following are our stockpiles and the estimated recoverable copper contained within those stockpiles as of december 31 2018  

 

mineralized material 

we hold various properties containing mineralized material that we believe could be brought into production should market conditions warrant however permitting and significant capital expenditures would be required before operations could commence at these properties mineralized material is a mineralized body that has been delineated by appropriately spaced drilling andor underground sampling to support the reported tonnage and average metal grades such a deposit cannot qualify as recoverable proven and probable reserves until legal and economic feasibility are confirmed based upon a comprehensive evaluation of development costs unit costs grades recoveries and other material factors estimated mineralized materials as presented on the following page were assessed using prices of 300  per pound for copper 1200  per ounce for gold 12  per pound for molybdenum and 20 per ounce for silver refer to item 1a “risk factors” for discussion of risks associated with our estimates of mineralized material

oil and gas operations 

as further discussed in note 2  during the three years ended december 31 2018 we completed the sales of substantially all of our oil and gas properties as a result our portfolio of oil and gas assets at december 31 2018  included natural gas production onshore in south louisiana and oil production offshore in california which had estimated proved developed reserves of 72 million  barrels of oil equivalents mmboe 

exploration and development activities 

capital expenditures associated with oil and gas properties totaled 2 million  in 2018 and we have no plans to incur significant capital expenditures associated with oil and gas properties in future periods capital expenditures for our oil and gas operations totaled 34 million in 2017 and 12 billion  in 2016 including 06 billion  incurred for gulf of mexico and 05 billion  for changes in capital expenditure accruals 

production and sales data 

oil and gas sales totaled 31 mmboe in 2018 and 46 mmboe in 2017 oil and gas production and sales for the year 2016 totaled 471  mmboe including 344  million barrels mmbbls of oil 651 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 18  mmbbls of natural gas liquids 

productive wells 

at december 31 2018  and 2017 the total number of active producing oil and gas wells was not significant at december 31 2016  we had working interests in 120 gross 94 net active producing oil wells and 640 gross 100 net active producing natural gas wells 

drilling activities 

as of and for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017 there were no exploratory or development wells drilled or in progress during the year ended december 31 2016 we drilled 3 gross 2 net exploratory productive wells and 9 gross 5 net development productive wells

this report contains “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of united states us federal securities laws forwardlooking statements are all statements other than statements of historical facts such as projections or expectations relating to ore grades and milling rates production and sales volumes unit net cash costs operating cash flows capital expenditures our expectations regarding our share of pt freeport indonesia’s ptfi future cash flows through 2022 ptfi’s development financing construction and completion of a new smelter in indonesia exploration efforts and results development and production activities rates and costs liquidity tax rates supply of and demand for and the impact of copper gold and molybdenum price changes the impact of deferred intercompany profits on earnings reserve estimates future dividend payments and share purchases and sales 

we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements we caution readers that forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated expected projected or assumed in the forwardlooking statements important factors that can cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements include the following 

financial risks 

fluctuations in the market prices of copper gold and molybdenum have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in our financial performance and in the trading prices of our debt and common stock extended declines in the market prices of copper gold and to a lesser extent molybdenum could adversely affect our earnings cash flows and asset values and if sustained may adversely affect our ability to repay debt 

our financial results will vary with fluctuations in the market prices of the commodities we produce primarily copper and gold and to a lesser extent molybdenum an extended decline in market prices of these commodities could have a material adverse effect on our financial results the value of our assets andor our ability to repay our debt and meet our other fixed obligations and may depress the trading prices of our common stock and of our publicly traded debt securities 

 35 

additionally if market prices for our primary commodities decline for a sustained period of time we may have to revise our operating plans including curtailing production reducing operating costs and capital expenditures and discontinuing certain exploration and development programs we may be unable to decrease our costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues in which case we may incur losses and those losses may be material 

fluctuations in commodities prices are caused by varied and complex factors beyond our control including global supply and demand balances and inventory levels global economic and political conditions international regulatory trade and tax policies including national tariffs commodities investment activity and speculation interest rates the strength of the us dollar compared to foreign currencies the price and availability of substitute products and changes in technology volatility in global economic growth particularly in developing economies has the potential to adversely affect future demand and prices for commodities geopolitical uncertainty and protectionism including the united kingdom’s plans to exit from the european union commonly referred to as brexit have the potential to inhibit international trade and negatively impact business confidence which creates the risk of constraints on our ability to trade in certain markets and has the potential to increase price volatility 

copper prices may be affected by demand from china which has become the largest consumer of refined copper in the world and by changes in demand for industrial commercial and residential products containing copper rising trade tensions between the us and china and efforts by the chinese government to reduce debt levels contributed to a recent slowdown in china’s growth a continued slowing in china’s economic growth and demand and continued trade tensions between the us and china could result in lower copper prices which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations including cash flow the adoption and expansion of trade restrictions changes in the state of chinaus relations including the current trade war or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies are difficult to predict and could adversely affect demand for our products our costs our customers our suppliers and the us economy which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

copper prices have fluctuated historically with london metal exchange lme copper settlement prices ranging from 196  per pound to 329  per pound during the three years ended december 31 2018  lme copper settlement prices averaged 296  per pound in 2018 280 per pound in 2017 and 221 per pound in 2016 the lme copper settlement price was 271  per pound on december 31 2018  and 279  per pound on january 31 2019  

factors affecting gold prices may include the relative strength of the us dollar to other currencies inflation and interest rate expectations purchases and sales of gold by governments and central banks demand from china and india two of the world ’ s largest consumers of gold and global demand for jewelry containing gold the london pm gold price averaged 1268  per ounce in 2018 1257 per ounce in 2017 and 1250 per ounce in 2016 the london pm gold price was 1279  per ounce on december 28 2018 there was no london pm gold price quote on december 31 2018  and 1323  per ounce on january 31 2019  

the metals week  molybdenum dealer oxide weekly average price averaged 1193  per pound in 2018 821 per pound in 2017 and 647 per pound in 2016 the metals week  molybdenum dealer oxide weekly average price was 1188  per pound on december 31 2018  and 1095  per pound on january 31 2019  

declines in prices of commodities we sell could result in metals inventory adjustments and impairment charges for our longlived assets other events that could result in impairment of our longlived assets include but are not limited to decreases in estimated proven and probable mineral reserves and any event that might have a material adverse effect on current and future expected mine production costs 

our debt and other financial commitments may limit our financial and operating flexibility 

at december 31 2018  our total consolidated debt was  111 billion  see note 8  and our total consolidated cash was 42 billion  we also have various other financial commitments including reclamation and environmental obligations takeorpay contracts and leases for further information refer to the risk factor below relating to mine closure and reclamation regulations and plugging and abandonment obligations related to our remaining oil and gas properties 

 36 

our level of indebtedness and other financial commitments could have important consequences to our business including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

any failure to comply with the financial and other covenants in our debt agreements may result in an event of default that would allow the creditors to accelerate maturities of the related debt which in turn may trigger crossacceleration or crossdefault provisions in other debt agreements our available cash and liquidity may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our debt instruments that are accelerated upon an event of default 

from august 2015 through november 2016 we sold 3265 million shares of our common stock under registered atthemarket equity programs which generated 35 billion in gross proceeds refer to note 10  in addition during 2016 we issued 481 million  shares of our common stock in connection with the settlement of two drilling rig contracts refer to note 13  and 277 million  shares of our common stock in exchange for 369 million  of fcx senior notes refer to note 10  any additional issuance of equity capital to fund operations reduce debt improve our financial position or for other purposes may have a negative impact on our stock price 

as of january 31 2019  our senior unsecured debt was rated “bb“ with a stable outlook by standard  poor’s sp “bb” with a negative outlook by fitch ratings fitch and “ba2” with a stable outlook by moody’s investors service moody’s there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not be downgraded in the future 

certain of our debt agreements including our revolving credit facility use the london interbank offered rate libor as a reference rate in july 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 if libor is unavailable after 2021 our debt with interest rates that are indexed to libor will be determined using various alternative methods to the extent provided for in our agreements which could result in increases in interest rates on such debt further we may need to renegotiate our debt agreements and the loans that utilize libor to replace libor with the new standard that is established by the us alternative rate reference committee which is currently expected to be the secured overnight bank financing rate 

mine closure and reclamation regulations impose substantial costs on our operations and include requirements that we provide financial assurance supporting those obligations we also have plugging and abandonment obligations related to our remaining oil and gas properties and are required to provide bonds or other forms of financial assurance in connection with those properties   changes in or the failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us 

we are required by us federal and state laws and regulations to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans for our mining properties if we are unable to do so the us environmental protection agency epa and state agencies may also require financial assurance for investigation and remediation actions that are required under settlements of enforcement actions under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 cercla or similar state laws refer to note 12  for additional information regarding our financial assurance obligations 

with respect to our mining operations most of our financial assurance obligations are imposed by state laws that vary significantly by jurisdiction depending on how each state regulates land use and groundwater quality although section 108b of cercla has required epa to identify classes of facilities that must establish evidence of financial responsibility since cercla was adopted in 1980 currently there are no financial assurance requirements for 

 37 

active mining operations under cercla in response to litigation initiated by several environmental organizations against epa and a subsequent settlement epa proposed financial assurance regulations for the hard rock mining industry in january 2017 which were vigorously opposed by us and others in the mining industry as proposed the rules would have imposed financial responsibility obligations on us hard rock mining operations that are unnecessary duplicative of existing state and other federal requirements and unreasonable our initial calculations suggested that the financial responsibility amounts would be difficult if not impossible for us and others to meet with corporate resources and would be extremely expensive if not impossible to finance with thirdparty financial instruments such as letters of credit bonds or insurance in december 2017 epa withdrew its proposed rules and in february 2018 epa published its final decision that additional financial assurance regulations for the hard rock mining industry would not be needed given the existing state and federal regulatory programs that became effective in march 2018 in may 2018 environmental organizations filed a petition for review with the us court of appeals for the district of columbia we and others in the mining industry intervened in the case if the court remands the rule back to epa for reconsideration a reproposal of rules similar in nature to epa’s 2017 proposed rules would severely harm the international competitiveness of the us hard rock mining industry and would materially and adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

we are also subject to financial assurance requirements in connection with our remaining oil and gas properties under both state and federal laws including financial responsibility required under the oil pollution act of 1990 to cover containment and cleanup costs resulting from an oil spill in 2016 the us bureau of ocean energy management boem issued revised requirements for lessees operating in federal waters to secure the cost of plugging abandoning decommissioning andor removing wells platforms and pipelines at the end of production the revised requirements eliminate previously provided waivers from requirements to post security in early 2017 the boem announced a delay in the implementation of certain aspects of the rules pending further review and in june 2017 boem further extended the start date for implementation indefinitely this extension currently remains in effect if implemented the new requirements could require us to post security in the form of bonds or similar assurances the cost for bonds or other forms of assurances can be substantial and there is no assurance that they can be obtained in all cases 

as of december 31 2018  our financial assurance obligations totaled 12 billion  for closure and reclamationrestoration costs of us mining sites and 05 billion  for plugging and abandonment obligations of our remaining oil and gas properties a substantial portion of our financial assurance obligations are satisfied by fcx and subsidiary guarantees and financial capability demonstrations our ability to continue to provide guarantees and financial capability demonstrations depends on state and other regulatory requirements our financial performance and our financial condition other forms of assurance such as letters of credit and surety bonds are costly to provide and depending on our financial condition and market conditions may be difficult or impossible to obtain failure to provide the required financial assurance could result in the closure of the affected properties 

refer to notes 1  and 12  for further discussion of our environmental and asset retirement obligations 

unanticipated litigation or negative developments in pending litigation or with respect to other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

we are involved in numerous legal proceedings and subject to other contingencies that have arisen or may arise in the ordinary course of our business or are associated with environmental issues including those described in note 12  and in item 3 “legal proceedings” involving matters such as remediation restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination claims of personal injury or property damage arising from such contamination or from exposure to substances such as lead arsenic asbestos talc and other allegedly toxic substances disputes over water rights and disputes with foreign governments or regulatory authorities over royalties taxes rights and obligations under concession or other agreements or other matters we are also involved periodically in other reviews inquiries   investigations and other proceedings initiated by or involving government agencies some of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief in addition from time to time we are involved in disputes over the allocation of environmental remediation obligations at superfund and other sites the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant monetary damages penalties other sanctions or injunctive relief against us limitations on our property rights or regulatory interpretations that increase our operating costs management does not believe based on currently available information that the outcome of any individual legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition although individual or cumulative outcomes could be material to our operating 

 38 

results for a particular period depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period 

with respect to the asbestos and talc exposure cases described in note 12  there has been a recent significant increase in the number of cases alleging the presence of asbestos contamination in talcbased personal care products and in cases alleging exposure to talc products that are not alleged to be contaminated with asbestos in these cases plaintiffs allege serious health risks and often fatal diseases including mesothelioma and ovarian cancer allegedly caused by longterm use of talcbased cosmetic and personal care products nationwide trial results in these cases have ranged from outright dismissals to very large jury awards of both compensatory and punitive damages the primary targets have been the producers of those products but defendants in many of these cases also include talc miners cyprus amax minerals company camc an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of fcx is one of those targets one of camc’s wholly owned subsidiaries cyprus mines corporation was involved in talc mining until 1992 when it exited that business camc has contractual indemnification rights subject to limited reservations against the ultimate successor to the business which has acknowledged those indemnification obligations and has taken responsibility for all cases tendered to it to date however on february 13 2019 the indemnitor filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and camc is in the very early stages of evaluating the potential implications of that filing 

we may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to   our defined benefit pension plans 

we sponsor two defined benefit pension plans for certain current and former employee in the us and a few pension plans for nonus locations which provide for specified payments after retirement the major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets investment returns interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet a sustained period of low or insufficient returns could require us to fund our pension plans to a greater extent than anticipated refer to note 9  for further discussion 

international risks 

our international operations are subject to political economic social and regional risks of doing business in countries outside the us 

we are a usbased mining company with substantial assets located outside of the us we conduct international mining operations in indonesia peru and chile and exploration activities in various foreign jurisdictions accordingly in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in countries outside the us our business may be adversely affected by political economic social and regional uncertainties in each of these countries risks of conducting business in countries outside the us include 

 

 

 

 



 39 

 

 

 

 

 

our insurance does not cover most losses caused by the above described risks accordingly our exploration development and production activities outside of the us may be substantially affected by many unpredictable factors beyond our control some of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

our international operations must comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption and antibribery laws of the other jurisdictions in which we operate there has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of these laws in recent years we operate in certain jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances compliance with anticorruption and antibribery laws and heightened expectations of enforcement authorities may be in tension with certain local customs and practices there can be no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from misinterpretation of or noncompliance with applicable laws and internal policies recklessness fraudulent behavior dishonesty or other inappropriate acts committed by our affiliates employees agents or contractors as such our corporate policies and processes may not prevent or detect all potential breaches of law or other governance practices any violation of those laws could result in significant criminal or civil fines and penalties litigation and loss of operating licenses or permits and may damage our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

we are involved in several significant tax proceedings and other tax disputes with indonesian and peruvian tax authorities refer to note 12  for further discussion of these matters other risks specific to certain countries in which we operate are discussed in more detail below 

because our mining operation in indonesia is a significant operating asset our business may be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties in indonesia 

our indonesia mining operations include the grasberg minerals district one of the world’s largest copper and gold deposits these operations are conducted by our subsidiary ptfi pursuant to a special mining license iupk issued by the indonesian government on december 21 2018 which replaced ptfi’s former contract of work cow entered into in december 1991 under the terms of the iupk ptfi has been granted an extension of mining rights through 2031 with rights to extend its mining rights through 2041 subject to among other things ptfi completing the construction of a new smelter in indonesia by december 21 2023 and fulfilling its defined fiscal obligations to the indonesian government refer to note 13 for a summary of the iupk’s key fiscal terms 

ptfi has applied for a oneyear extension of its export license which currently expires on february 16 2019 export licenses are valid for one year periods subject to review and approval by the indonesian government every six months depending on smelter construction progress 

maintaining a good working relationship with the indonesian government is important because of the significance of our indonesia operations to our business and because our mining operations there are among indonesia’s most significant business enterprises the grasberg minerals district has been designated by the indonesian government as one of indonesia’s vital national assets partially because of its significance to indonesia’s economy the environmentally sensitive area where it is located and the number of people employed our indonesia operations have been the subject of political debates and of criticism in the indonesian press and have been the target of 

 40 

protests and occasional violence improper management of our working relationship with the indonesian government could lead to a disruption of operations andor impact our reputation in indonesia and in the region where we operation which could adversely affect our business in addition pt indonesia asahan aluminium persero pt inalum a shareholder in ptfi is an indonesian stateowned enterprise disputes between us and pt inalum may result in litigation or arbitration which could increase our expenses and distract our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business 

the indonesian mining industry is subject to extensive regulation within indonesia and there have been major developments in laws and regulations applicable to mining concession holders some of which have conflicted with ptfi’s contractual rights in the past in particular the enactment of law no 4 of 2009 on coal and mineral mining on january 12 2009 the mining law replaced the previous regulatory framework which allowed concession holders including ptfi to conduct mining activities in indonesia under a contract of work system the mining law which sets out the regulatory framework for the mining industry in indonesia only contains substantive principles and leaves many specific issues to be addressed in implementing regulations some of which have conflicted with ptfi’s contractual rights in the past including but not limited to regulations that imposed a progressive export duty on copper concentrate restricted exports of copper concentrate and anode slimes increased royalty rates and required payment of a smelter assurance bond to support a commitment to construct a new smelter in indonesia refer to note 13 for further discussion of the smelter assurance bond in january 2017 ptfi suspended exports through april 2017 in response to these mining law regulations 

the mining law stipulated that previously granted mining rights through a contract of work would continue to be valid until expiry subject to certain adjustments ptfi’s former cow was concluded pursuant to the 1967 foreign capital investment law which provided basic guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization a framework for economic incentives and basic rules regarding other rights and obligations of foreign investors the initial term of ptfi’s former cow was scheduled to expire in 2021 and explicitly provided that it could be extended for two 10year periods subject to indonesian government approval which could not be withheld or delayed unreasonably prior to the issuance of the iupk to ptfi in december 2018 ptfi had been engaged in discussions with the indonesian government since 2012 regarding various provisions of its former cow including extending its term notwithstanding provisions in ptfi’s former cow prohibiting it from doing so the indonesian government sought to modify ptfi’s former cow to address provisions contained in the mining law and implementing regulations adopted thereunder some of which were not required under or conflicted with ptfi’s former cow including but not limited to i restrictions on ptfi’s basic right to export mining products ii imposition of additional export duties iii imposition of excess surface water taxes refer to note 12  iv imposition of new requirement to build additional smelter capacity in indonesia v unreasonable withholding and delay in granting approval of two successive tenyear extensions of the term of the former cow and vi imposition of new divestment requirements 

we cannot assure you that future regulatory changes affecting the mining industry in indonesia will not be introduced or unexpectedly repealed or that new interpretations of existing laws and regulations will not be issued which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in 2019 indonesia will hold national legislative elections the presidential election will be held in april 2019 with a runoff in august 2019 if required political considerations leading up to these elections could affect the country’s policies pertaining to foreign investment which could adversely affect our indonesia mining operations 

we will not mine all of ptfi’s ore reserves in the grasberg minerals district before the initial term of ptfi’s iupk expires in 2031 and the iupk may not be extended through 2041 if ptfi fails to abide by the terms and conditions of the iupk and applicable laws and regulations 

as discussed in the above risk factor “ because our mining operation in indonesia is a significant operating asset our business may be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties in indonesia ” on december 21 2018 ptfi was granted a new iupk to replace its former cow enabling ptfi to conduct operations in the grasberg minerals district through 2041 under the terms of the iupk ptfi has been granted mining rights through 2031 with rights to extend its mining rights through 2041 subject to among other things ptfi completing the construction of a new smelter in indonesia by december 21 2023 and fulfilling its defined fiscal obligations to the indonesian government refer to note 13 for a summary of the iupk’s key fiscal terms 

 41 

the iupk also requires ptfi to pay duties on concentrate exports of 5 percent declining to 25 percent when smelter development progress exceeds 30 percent and eliminated when smelter development progress exceeds 50 percent smelter development progress will be determined by an independent verifier appointed by the ministry of energy and mineral resources memr and subject to approval by the memr ptfi is initiating frontend engineering and design and intends to pursue financing commercial and potential partner arrangements for this project which has a preliminary estimated capital cost in the 3 billion range the economics of the new smelter will be borne by ptfi’s shareholders according to their respective longterm share ownership percentages ptfi’s ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions future market prices as well as ptfi’s operational performance cash flow and debt position among other factors financing may not be available when needed or if available the terms of such financing may not be favorable to ptfi 

our proven and probable ore reserves in indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041 and ptfi’s current longterm mine plan and planned operations are based on the assumption that ptfi will abide by the terms and conditions of the iupk and will be granted the 10year extension from 2031 through 2041 as a result we will not mine all of these ore reserves during the initial term of the iupk prior to the end of 2031 we expect to mine 53 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable ore at december 31 2018 representing 57 percent of our net equity share of recoverable copper reserves and 64 percent of our net equity share of recoverable gold reserves 

if ptfi does not complete the construction of a new smelter in indonesia by december 21 2023 or fulfill its defined fiscal obligations to the indonesian government as set forth in the iupk the iupk will likely not be extended from 2031 to 2041 and we would be unable to mine all of ptfi’s ore reserves in the grasberg minerals district which would adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position 

operational risks 

our mining operations are subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our business and our underground mining operations can be particularly dangerous 

our mines are very large in scale and by their nature are subject to significant operational risks some of which are outside of our control and many of which are not covered fully or in some cases even partially by insurance these operational risks which could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and cash flow include earthquakes rainstorms floods and other natural disasters equipment failures accidents wall failures and rock slides in our openpit mines and structural collapses of our underground mines or tailings impoundments and lower than expected ore grades or recovery rates 

since late january 2019 our el abra operation in chile has experienced heavy rainfall and electrical storms resulting in a suspension of operations since february 4 2019 we have been unable to assess damages because of poor road conditions and inaccessible areas and we do not currently know when normal operations will resume we estimate the impact on 2019 production will approximate 8 million pounds of copper through midfebruary 2019 and additional impacts of approximately 600 thousand pounds of copper per day are expected until normal operations resume 

underground mining operations can be particularly dangerous and in may 2013 a tragic accident which resulted in 28 fatalities and 10 injuries occurred at ptfi when the rock structure above the ceiling of an underground training facility collapsed ptfi temporarily suspended mining and processing activities at the grasberg complex to conduct inspections and resumed openpit mining and concentrating activities in june 2013 and underground operations in july 2013 no assurance can be given that similar events will not occur in the future 

in addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry our indonesia mining operations involve additional 

risks given that such operations are located in steep mountainous terrain in a remote area of indonesia these 

conditions have required us to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities the area also receives considerable rainfall which has led to periodic floods and mudslides further the 

mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time our insurance may 

not sufficiently cover an unexpected natural or operating disaster 

the waste rock including overburden and tailings produced in our mining operations represent our largest volume of waste material managing the volume of waste rock and tailings presents significant environmental safety and 

 42 

engineering challenges and risks primarily relating to structural stability geochemistry water quality and dust generation management of this waste is regulated in the jurisdictions where we operate and our programs are designed to be in compliance with applicable national state and local laws permits and approved environmental impact studies we maintain large leach pads and tailings impoundments containing viscous material which are effectively large dams that must be engineered constructed and monitored to ensure structural stability and avoid leakages or structural collapse our tailings impoundments in arid areas must have effective programs to suppress fugitive dust emissions and we must effectively monitor and treat acid rock drainage at all of our operations in indonesia we use a river transport system for tailings management which presents other risks as discussed below 

we currently operate 19 tailings storage facilities and manage 55 that are inactive or have been reclaimed approximately twothirds of these have been reclaimed the failure of tailings and other impoundments at any of our mining operations could cause severe and in some cases catastrophic property and environmental damage and loss of life and we apply significant financial resources and both internal and external technical resources to the safe management of all those facilities the importance of careful design management and monitoring of large impoundments has been emphasized in recent years including as recently as january 2019 by large scale tailings dam failures at unaffiliated mines which resulted in numerous fatalities and caused extensive property and environmental damage our tailings management and stewardship program which involves qualified external engineers of record and periodic oversight by independent external tailings review boards at numerous operations complies with the tailings governance framework on preventing catastrophic failure of tailings storage facilities adopted in december 2016 by the international council on mining and metals icmm and required to be implemented by icmm members we continue to enhance our existing practices and work with icmm members on additional initiatives to strengthen critical controls for the design operation and closure of tailings storage facilities in an effort to reduce the risk of severe or catastrophic failure of tailings storage facilities but no assurance can be given that these events will not occur in the future 

labor unrest violence activism and civil and religious strife could disrupt our operations and may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

as of december 31 2018  approximately 37 percent  of our global labor force was covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 21 percent  of our global labor force was covered by agreements that have expired and are currently being negotiated or will expire during 2019 

labor agreements are negotiated on a periodic basis and may not be renewed on reasonably satisfactory terms to us or at all if we do not successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements with our union workers we may incur prolonged strikes and other work stoppages at our mining operations which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations additionally if we enter into a new labor agreement with any union that significantly increases our labor costs relative to our competitors our ability to compete may be materially and adversely affected refer to items 1 and 2 “business and properties” for additional information regarding labor matters and expiration dates of such agreements 

we could also experience labor disruptions such as work stoppages work slowdowns union organizing campaigns strikes or lockouts that could adversely affect our operations for example during thirdquarter 2016 ptfi experienced labor productivity issues and a 10day work stoppage that began in late september 2016 these labor productivity issues continued during fourthquarter 2016 and the first half of 2017 beginning in midapril 2017 ptfi experienced a high level of worker absenteeism which unfavorably impacted mining and milling rates a significant number of employees and contractors elected to participate in an illegal strike action beginning in may 2017 and were subsequently deemed to have voluntarily resigned under existing indonesian laws and regulations resulting in increased costs associated with employee severance we cannot predict whether additional labor disruptions will occur significant reductions in productivity or protracted work stoppages at one or more of our operations could significantly reduce our production and sales volumes or disrupt operations which could adversely affect our cash flow results of operations and financial condition 

indonesia has long faced separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces several separatist groups have sought increased political independence for the province of papua where our grasberg minerals district is located in papua there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the indonesian military and police in addition illegal miners have periodically clashed with police who have attempted for years to move them away from our facilities social 

 43 

economic and political instability in papua could materially and adversely affect us if it results in damage to our property or interruption of our indonesia operations 

in 2009 a series of shooting incidents occurred within the ptfi project area including along the road leading to our mining and milling operations the shooting incidents continued on a sporadic basis through january 2015 during this time there were 20 fatalities and more than 50 injuries to our employees contractor employees government security personnel and civilians the next shooting incident occurred in august 2017 and a series of shooting incidents continued on a sporadic basis within the ptfi project area and in nearby areas through august 2018 resulting in two fatalities and 25 injuries in december 2018 a mass shooting incident targeting a highway construction crew occurred in a remote mountain area approximately 100 miles east of the ptfi project area resulting in at least 19 fatalities and several reported as missing ptfi continues to monitor the situation in the region 

the safety of our workforce is a critical concern and ptfi continues to work with the indonesian government to address security issues within the ptfi project area and in nearby areas we continue to limit the use of the road leading to our mining and milling operations to secured convoys including transport of personnel by armored vehicles in designated areas 

we cannot predict whether additional incidents will occur that could disrupt or suspend our operations if other disruptive incidents occur they could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in ways that we cannot predict at this time 

our mining operations depend on the availability of significant quantities of secure water supplies 

our mining operations require physical availability and secure legal rights to significant quantities of water for mining and ore processing activities and related support facilities most of our north america and south america mining operations are in areas where competition for water supplies is significant continuous production at our mines is dependent on many factors including our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies 

as discussed in item 3 “legal proceedings” in arizona where our operations use both surface and groundwater we are a participant in an active general stream adjudication in which arizona courts have been attempting for over 40 years to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for the gila river one of the state’s largest river systems this stream adjudication primarily affects our morenci safford and sierrita mines the adjudication is addressing the state law claims of thousands of competing users including us as well as significant federal water claims that are potentially adverse to the state law claims of both surface water and groundwater users groundwater is treated differently from surface water under arizona law which historically allowed landowners to pump subsurface water subject only to the requirement of putting it to “reasonable use” however court decisions in the adjudication have concluded that some underground water constitutes “subflow” that is to be treated legally as surface water and is therefore subject to the arizona doctrine of prior appropriation and subject to the adjudication and potentially unavailable to groundwater pumpers in the absence of valid surface water claims any recharacterization of groundwater as surface water could affect the ability of consumers farmers ranchers municipalities and industrial users like us to continue to access water supplies that have been relied on for decades because we are a user of both groundwater and surface water in arizona we are an active participant in the adjudication proceedings given the legal and technical complexity of these adjudications their long history and their longterm legal economic and political implications it is difficult to predict the timing or the outcome of these proceedings if we are not able to satisfactorily resolve the issues being addressed in the adjudications our ability to pump groundwater could be diminished or curtailed and our operations at morenci safford and sierrita could be adversely affected unless we are able to acquire alternative resources 

water for our cerro verde operation in peru comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the rio chili watershed that collects water primarily from seasonal precipitation as a result of occasional drought conditions temporary supply shortages are possible that could affect our cerro verde operations 

water for our el abra mining operation in chile comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascotán aquifer in 2010 el abra obtained regulatory approval for the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascotán aquifer for its sulfide processing plant which began operations in 2011 the agreement to pump from this aquifer is subject to continued monitoring of the aquifer level to ensure that environmentally 

 44 

sensitive areas are not impacted by our pumping if impact occurs we would have to reduce pumping to restore water levels which could have an adverse effect on production from el abra 

although we typically have sufficient water for our indonesian operations the area receives considerable rainfall that has led to periodic floods and mudslides lower rainfall could affect our water supply availability from time to time 

although each of our mining operations currently has access to sufficient water supplies to support current operational demands as discussed above some supplies are subject to adjudication proceedings the outcome of which we cannot predict and the availability of additional supplies that may be required for potential future expansions is uncertain while we are taking actions to acquire additional backup water supplies such supplies may not be available at acceptable cost or at all so that the loss of a water right or currently available water supply could force us to curtail operations or force premature closures thereby increasing andor accelerating costs or foregoing profitable operations 

development projects are inherently risky and may require more capital than anticipated which could adversely affect our business the development of our underground mines and operations are also subject 

to other unique risks 

mine development projects typically require a number of years and significant expenditures during the development phase before production is possible currently our major mining projects include underground development activities in the grasberg minerals district which currently constitutes approximately 30 percent  of our estimated consolidated recoverable proven and probable copper reserves and development of the lone star oxide project in arizona there are many risks and uncertainties inherent in all development projects including but not limited to unexpected or difficult geological formations or conditions potential delays cost overruns lower levels of production during rampup periods shortages of material or labor construction defects breakdowns and injuries to persons and property the development of our underground mines and operations are also subject to other unique risks including but not limited to underground fires or floods ventilating harmful gases fallofground accidents and seismic activity resulting from unexpected or difficult geological formations or conditions while we anticipate taking all measures that we deem reasonable and prudent in connection with the development of our underground mines to safely manage production there is no assurance that these risks will not cause schedule delays revised mine plans injuries to persons and property or increased capital costs any of which may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition additionally although we devote significant time and resources to our project planning approval and review processes many of our development projects are highly complex and rely on factors that are outside of our control which may cause us to underestimate the time and capital required to complete a development project 

for example in september 2015 we initiated precommercial production at the deep mill level zone dmlz underground mine in the grasberg minerals district during secondquarter 2018 ptfi revised its mine plans to incorporate a slower rampup of the dmlz underground mine following the continuing occurrence of mining induced seismic activity experienced in 2017 and 2018 ptfi commenced hydraulic fracturing activities during thirdquarter 2018 to manage rock stresses and precondition the dmlz underground mine for largescale production although results to date have been effective in managing rock stresses we cannot predict whether additional occurrences of seismic activity or other unexpected geological activity will occur that could cause schedule delays or additional revisions to ptfi’s mine plans which could adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition ptfi currently expects the dmlz to reach full production rates of 80000 metric tons per day in 2022 however estimates of timing of future production continue to be reviewed and may be modified as additional information becomes available 

our decision to develop a project is typically based on the results of feasibility studies which estimate the anticipated economic returns of a project in addition the economic feasibility of development projects is based on many factors including the accuracy of estimated reserves estimated capital and operating costs and estimated future prices of the relevant commodity consolidated capital expenditures are expected to approximate 24 billion for the year 2019 including 15 billion  for major mining projects primarily associated with underground development activities in the grasberg minerals district and development of the lone star oxide project 

new development projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future cash flow the actual costs production rates and economic returns of our development projects may differ materially from our estimates which may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

 45 

we must continually replace reserves depleted by production but exploration is highly speculative and our exploration activities may not result in additional discoveries 

our existing mineral reserves will be depleted over time by production from our operations because our profits are primarily derived from our mining operations our ability to replenish our mineral reserves is essential to our longterm success depleted reserves can be replaced in several ways including expanding known ore bodies by locating new deposits or acquiring interests in reserves from third parties exploration is highly speculative in nature involves many risks and uncertainties requires substantial capital expenditures and is frequently unsuccessful in discovering significant mineralization accordingly our current or future exploration programs may not result in the discovery of additional deposits that can be produced profitably even if significant mineralization is discovered it will likely take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production during which time the economic feasibility of production may change we may not be able to discover enhance develop or acquire reserves in sufficient quantities to maintain or grow our current reserve levels which could negatively affect our cash flow results of operations and financial condition 

estimates of proven and probable reserves and mineralized material are uncertain and the volume and grade of ore actually recovered may vary from our estimates 

estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves have been calculated in accordance with industry guide 7 as required by the securities exchange act of 1934 there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating mineral reserves such estimates are to a large extent based on the average prices for the commodities we produce primarily copper gold and molybdenum and interpretations of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other exploration techniques which data may not necessarily be indicative of future results our mineral reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies we conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk we revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies geological assumptions about our mineralization that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available 

estimates of proven and probable reserves that will be recovered or the cost at which we anticipate reserves will be recovered are based on uncertain assumptions the uncertain global financial outlook may affect economic assumptions related to reserve recovery and may require reserve revisions changes to reserve estimates could affect our asset carrying values and may also negatively impact our future financial condition and results 

in addition if the market prices for the commodities we produce decline from recent levels if production costs increase or recovery rates decrease or if applicable laws and regulations are adversely changed we can offer no assurance that the indicated level of recovery will be realized or that mineral reserves can be mined or processed profitably if we determine that certain of our estimated proven and probable reserves have become uneconomic this may ultimately lead to a reduction in our aggregate reported reserves which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

additionally the term “mineralized material” does not indicate proven and probable reserves as defined by the us securities and exchange commission mineralized material is a mineralized body that has been delineated by appropriately spaced drilling andor underground sampling to support the reported tonnage and average metal grades such a deposit cannot qualify as recoverable proven and probable reserves until legal and economic feasibility are confirmed based upon a comprehensive evaluation of development costs unit costs grades recoveries and other material factors and are therefore subject to considerable uncertainty accordingly no assurance can be given that the estimated mineralized material not included in reserves will become proven and probable reserves 

our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations some of which require permits and other approvals these regulations increase our costs and in some circumstances may delay or suspend our operations 

our operations are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations that are subject to change and to changing interpretation by governmental agencies and other bodies vested with broad supervisory authority as a mining company compliance with environmental legal requirements is an integral and costly part of our business for additional information see “environmental risks” below we are also subject to extensive regulation of worker health and safety including the requirements of the us occupational safety and health act and similar laws of 

 46 

other jurisdictions in the us the operation of our mines is subject to regulation by the us mine safety and health administration msha under the federal mine safety and health act of 1977 mine act msha inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the mine act additionally in the us various state agencies have concurrent jurisdiction arising under state law that regulate worker health and safety in both our industrial facilities and mines if regulatory inspections result in an alleged violation we may be subject to fines and penalties and in instances of alleged significant violations our mining operations or industrial facilities could be subject to temporary or extended closures refer to exhibit 95 to this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding certain orders and citations issued by msha for our operations during the year ended december 31 2018 

  

many other governmental bodies regulate other aspects of our operations and our failure to comply with these legal requirements can result in substantial penalties in addition new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations by courts or regulatory authorities occur regularly but are difficult to predict any such variations could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow results of operations and financial condition 

our business is dependent upon information technology systems which may be adversely affected by disruptions damage failure and risks associated with implementation and integration 

our strategy of operating large longlived geographically diverse assets has been increasingly dependent on our ability to become fully integrated and highly automated many of our business and operational processes are heavily dependent on traditional and emerging technology systems to conduct daytoday operations improve safety and efficiency and lower costs as our dependence on information systems including those of our third party service providers and vendors grows we become more vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks 

cybersecurity incidents are increasing in frequency and magnitude these incidents may include but are not limited to installation of malicious software phishing credential attacks unauthorized access to data and other advanced 

and sophisticated cybersecurity breaches and threats including threats that increasingly target critical operational 

technologies and process control networks if any of these threats materialize we could be subject to manipulation 

or improper use of our systems and networks production downtimes communication interruption or other disruptions and delays to our operations or to the transportation of products or infrastructure utilized by our operations unauthorized release of proprietary commercially sensitive confidential or otherwise protected information the corruption of data significant health and safety consequences environmental damage loss of intellectual property fines and litigation damage to our reputation or financial losses from remedial actions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow results of operations and financial condition we have experienced targeted and nontargeted cybersecurity incidents in the past and may experience them in the future while these cybersecurity incidents did not result in any material loss to us or interrupt our daytoday operations there can be no assurance that we will not experience any such losses in the future 

we believe we have implemented appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks however given the unpredictability of the timing and the evolving nature and scope of information technology disruptions the various procedures and controls we use to monitor and protect against these threats and to mitigate our potential risks to such threats may not be sufficient in preventing cybersecurity incidents from materializing further as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities to cybersecurity threats 

we could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective not installed properly or not properly integrated into our operations various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to the system implementation and modification but system modification failures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations and could if not successfully implemented adversely impact the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 

 47 

environmental risks 

our operations are subject to complex evolving and increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations compliance with environmental regulatory requirements involves significant costs and may constrain existing operations or expansion opportunities 

our operations both in the us and internationally are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing the generation storage treatment transportation and disposal of hazardous substances solid waste disposal air emissions wastewater discharges remediation restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination including mine closures and reclamation well plug and abandonment requirements protection of endangered and protected species and designation of critical habitats and other related matters in addition we must obtain regulatory permits and approvals to start continue and expand operations 

our miami arizona smelter processes approximately half of the aggregate copper concentrate produced by our north america copper mines epa regulations required us to invest approximately 230 million in new pollution control equipment to reduce sulfur dioxide so 2  to meet both regional haze requirements and to allow the arizona department of environmental quality adeq to demonstrate compliance with epa’s so 2  ambient air quality standards the new so 2 pollution control equipment was operational as of the january 1 2018 deadline imposed by epa and the miami smelter has been in compliance with both the regional haze requirements and the adeq rules adeq also has two so 2  monitors in the miami area that continually read ambient so 2  levels and during 2018 there were several instances in which adeq’s monitors read so 2  levels that exceeded the specified level we are engaged in discussions with adeq and conducting an ongoing investigation of the cause of the ambient levels we cannot guarantee that we will not be required to modify our system or install additional equipment to address findings or reflect new requirements or for other reasons which could result in significant costs including increased capital expenditures and operating costs and could adversely impact our business 

laws such as cercla and similar state laws may expose us to joint and several liability for environmental damages caused by our operations or by previous owners or operators of properties we acquired or are currently operating or at sites where we sent materials for processing recycling or disposal as discussed in more detail in the next risk factor we have substantial obligations for environmental remediation on mining properties previously owned or operated by freeport minerals corporation fmc and certain of its affiliates noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in material penalties or other liabilities in addition compliance with these laws may from time to time result in delays in or changes to our development or expansion plans compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs which we expect will continue to increase over time because of increased regulatory oversight adoption of increasingly stringent environmental standards as well as other factors 

new or revised environmental regulatory requirements are frequently proposed many of which result in substantially increased costs for our business including those regarding financial assurance in the financial risk factor above 

in 2015 epa adopted rules that added remote “tributaries” into the regulatory definition of “waters of the united states” that are protected by the clean water act thereby imposing significant additional restrictions on land uses in remote areas with only tenuous connections to active waterways these rules were challenged by multiple states and industry parties and litigation is ongoing epa has moved forward to rescind these rules and reconsider the definition of “waters of the united states” to clarify the scope of waters federally regulated under the clean water act a prepublication version of a proposed revised definition of “waters of the united states” was issued by epa and the us army corps of engineers in december 2018 if adopted in final form as proposed federal permitting requirements under the clean water act could be less stringent which would limit or eliminate our need to obtain federal permits for future expansions at our operations in arizona and new mexico however there can be no assurance that the proposed revised definition will be adopted as proposed or that it will not be challenged by environmental groups 

regulations have been considered at various governmental levels to increase federal financial responsibility requirements both for mine closure and reclamation and for oil and gas decommissioning in january 2019 legislative bills were introduced in both colorado and new mexico that would eliminate selfbonding and parent company guarantees for financial assurance for mine closure and reclamation activities we are working to retain flexibility in financial assurance forms at our operations but if enacted as proposed we would be precluded from using parent company guarantees for any financial assurance obligations associated with our colorado and new mexico operations which would result in increased costs the legislative bill introduced in colorado would also 

 48 

require proof of an end date for water treatment as a condition of permit issuance authorizing mining operations also in january 2019 legislation was proposed in new mexico that would require water quality standards to be applied at the point of discharge to groundwater adoption of these or similar new environmental regulations or more stringent application of existing regulations may materially increase our costs threaten certain operating activities and constrain our expansion opportunities 

our mining operations are subject to regulations under the endangered species act esa that are intended to protect species listed by the department of interior’s fish  wildlife service fws as endangered or threatened along with critical habitat designated by fws for these listed species the regulations limit the ability of landowners including us to obtain federal permits or authorizations needed for expansion of our operations and may also affect our ability to obtain retain or deliver water to some operations these regulations were revised in 2016 to expand the ability of fws to designate critical habitat in areas that are not occupied by a listed species as part of its plan to modernize the implementation of the esa the fws issued proposed rules in july 2018 that if finalized could mitigate but not eliminate potential regulatory constraints on mining operations under the esa and change some aspects of the revised regulations adopted in 2016 fws is also evaluating whether certain species should still be listed under the esa and reconsidering critical habitat that was proposed but never finalized environmental groups have aggressively challenged fws’s regulatory reforms no assurances can be made that restrictions relating to conservation will not have an adverse impact on expansion of our operations or not result in delays in project development constraints on exploration and constraints on operations in impacted areas 

we incurred environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs including our joint venture partners’ shares to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect our operations totaling 04 billion  in 2018 05 billion  in 2017 and 04 billion  in 2016 for 2019  we expect to incur approximately 05 billion  of aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs the timing and amounts of estimated payments could change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements changes in scope and costs of reclamation and plug and abandonment activities the settlement of environmental matters and the rate at which actual spending occurs on continuing matters 

we incur significant costs for remediating environmental conditions on properties that have not been operated in many years 

fmc and its subsidiaries and many of their affiliates and predecessor companies have been involved in exploration mining milling smelting and manufacturing in the us for more than a century activities that occurred in the late 19th century and the 20th century prior to the advent of modern environmental laws were not subject to environmental regulation and were conducted before american industrial companies fully understood the longterm effects of their operations on the surrounding environment 

with the passage of cercla in 1980 companies like fmc became legally responsible for remediating hazardous substances released into the environment from properties owned or operated by them as well as properties where they arranged for disposal of such substances irrespective of when the release to the environment occurred or who caused it that liability is often asserted on a joint and several basis with other prior and subsequent owners operators and arrangers meaning that each owner or operator of the property is and each arranger may be held fully responsible for the remediation although in many cases some or all of the other responsible parties no longer exist do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found as a result because of our acquisition of fmc in 2007 many of the subsidiary companies we now own are potentially responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the us and we expect to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those remediation issues we are also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources at december 31 2018  we had more than 100  active remediation projects in 26  us states in addition fmc and certain affiliates and predecessor companies were parties to agreements relating to the transfer of businesses or properties that contained indemnification provisions relating to environmental matters and from time to time these provisions become the source of claims against us 

at december 31 2018  we had 15 billion  recorded in our consolidated balance sheet for environmental obligations attributable to cercla or analogous state programs and for estimated future costs associated with environmental matters at closed facilities or closed portions of operating facilities 

 49 

our environmental obligation estimates are primarily based upon 

 

 

 

significant adjustments to these estimates are likely to occur in the future as additional information becomes available the actual environmental costs may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs and any such changes could be material 

in addition remediation standards imposed by epa and state environmental agencies have generally become more stringent over time and may become even more stringent in the future imposition of more stringent remediation standards particularly for arsenic and lead in soils poses a risk that additional remediation work could be required at our active remediation sites and at sites that we have already remediated to the satisfaction of the responsible governmental agencies and may increase the risk of toxic tort litigation 

epa is considering how to reduce lead exposure in the environment under multiple environmental programs certain federal and state health agencies also support lower lead cleanup levels the timing for these epa activities is unclear but any reduction in lead cleanup levels could result in material increases to our environmental reserves for ongoing residential property cleanup projects near former smelter sites 

refer to note 12  for further discussion of our environmental obligations 

our indonesia mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges and future changes in environmental laws or unanticipated environmental impacts from those operations could require us to incur increased costs 

mining operations on the scale of our indonesia operations involve significant environmental risks and challenges our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of crushed and ground rock material called tailings that results from the process by which we physically separate the copper gold and silverbearing materials from the ore that we mine our tailings management plan which has been approved by the indonesian government uses the unnavigable river system in the highlands near our mine to transport the tailings to an engineered area in the lowlands where the tailings and natural sediments are managed in a deposition area lateral levees have been constructed to help contain the footprint of the tailings and to limit their impact in the lowlands 

another major environmental challenge is managing overburden which is the rock that must be moved aside in the mining process to reach the ore in the presence of air water and naturally occurring bacteria some overburden can generate acid rock drainage or acidic water containing dissolved metals that if not properly managed can adversely affect the environment in addition certain overburden stockpiles are subject to erosion caused by the large amounts of rainfall with the eroded stockpile material eventually being deposited in the lowlands tailings management area this additional material influences the deposition of finer sediment material in the estuary as well as presents the potential for increased environmental impacts the grasberg overburden stockpiles have experienced significant erosion   exacerbated by unanticipated work stoppages that adversely affected our ability to manage certain overburden stockpiles the current tailings deposition management plan as well as environmental monitoring programs take into account the presence of this overburden in the lowlands tailings management area 

in the past certain indonesian government officials have raised questions with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans including a suggestion that we implement a pipeline system rather than the river transport system for tailings management and disposition because our indonesia mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area a pipeline system would be costly difficult to construct and maintain and more prone to catastrophic failure and could therefore involve significant potentially 

 50 

adverse environmental issues based on our own studies and others conducted by third parties we do not believe that a pipeline system is necessary or practical 

in october 2017 indonesia’s ministry of environment and forestry the moef notified ptfi of administrative sanctions related to certain activities that it indicated are not reflected in ptfi’s environmental permit the moef also notified ptfi that certain operational activities were inconsistent with factors set forth in ptfi’s environmental permitting studies and that additional monitoring and improvements need to be undertaken related to air quality water drainage treatment and handling of certain wastes and tailings management in april 2018 the moef issued decrees imposing unattainable environmental standards related to ptfi’s controlled riverine tailings management system the decrees included a sixmonth transition period and conflicted with ptfi’s approved environmental management programs and existing environmental permits in december 2018 the moef issued a revised environmental permit to ptfi to address many of the operational activities that it alleged were inconsistent with earlier studies the remaining administrative sanctions are being resolved through adoption of revised practices and in a few situations ptfi has agreed with the moef on an appropriate multiyear work plan including the closure of an overburden stockpile 

ptfi and the moef also established a new framework for continuous improvement in environmental practices in ptfi’s operations including initiatives that ptfi will pursue to increase tailings retention and to evaluate largescale beneficial uses of tailings within indonesia the moef issued a new decree that incorporates various initiatives and studies to be completed by ptfi during 2019 targeting continuous improvement in a manner that would not impose new technical risks or significant longterm costs to ptfi’s operations the new framework enables ptfi to maintain compliance with sitespecific standards and provides for ongoing monitoring by the moef refer to note 12  for further discussion 

we cannot assure you that future environmental changes affecting the mining industry in indonesia will not be introduced or unexpectedly altered or repealed or that new interpretations of existing environmental laws and regulations will not be issued which might have a significant impact on ptfi 

our copper mining operations require significant energy and regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change issues may increase our costs and adversely   affect our operations 

our copper mining operations require significant energy principally diesel electricity coal and natural gas most of which is obtained from third parties under longterm contracts energy represented approximately 20 percent  of our copper mine site operating costs in 2018  and are expected to approximate 20 percent  of our copper mine site operating costs in 2019 

carbonbased energy is a significant input in our operations although haul truck diesel use and the amount of purchased power that is derived from fossil fuel or renewable sources varies significantly depending on site production and countryspecific circumstances the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would vary by operation based on particular geographic circumstances as a result of the paris agreement reached during the 21 st  conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change in 2015 a number of governments have pledged “nationally determined contributions” to control and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the us several states including colorado and new mexico have advanced goals reducing or eliminating fossilfuel based energy production transitions to renewable and other energy sources could among other things increase our operating and energy costs depending on the scope and magnitude of increased regulation of fossilfuel based energy production including greenhouse gas emissions 

other risks 

our holding company structure may impact our ability to service debt and our stockholders ’  ability to receive dividends  

we are a holding company with no material assets other than the capital stock and intercompany receivables of our subsidiaries as a result our ability to repay our indebtedness and pay dividends is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend loan debt repayment or otherwise our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to make funds available to us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends dividends from subsidiaries that are not wholly owned are shared with other equity owners cash at our international operations is also typically subject to foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation into the us 

 51 

in addition our subsidiaries may not be able to or be permitted to make distributions to us or repay loans to us to enable us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal restrictions as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries certain of our subsidiaries are parties to credit agreements that restrict their ability to make distributions or loan repayments to us if such subsidiary is in default under such agreements or to transfer substantially all of the assets of such subsidiary without the consent of the lenders 

our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries’ assets upon their liquidation reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries’ creditors including any trade creditors 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult these provisions 

 

 

 

 

these provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by the board 

in addition because we are incorporated in delaware we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with or acquisition of us 

these provisions may deter an acquisition of us that might otherwise be attractive to our stockholders

we are involved in numerous legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business or are associated with environmental issues we are also involved periodically in reviews inquiries investigations and other proceedings initiated by or involving government agencies some of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief management does not believe based on currently available information that the outcome of any legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition although individual or cumulative outcomes could be material to our operating results for a particular period depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period 

 52 

below is a discussion of our material legal proceedings not otherwise required to be disclosed in note 12 refer to note 12  for discussion of additional material legal proceedings 

water rights adjudications 

our operations in the western united states us require significant secure quantities of water for mining and ore processing activities and related support facilities continuous operation of our mines is dependent on among other things our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies in the arid western us where certain of our mines are located water rights are often contested and disputes over water rights are generally timeconsuming expensive and not necessarily dispositive unless they resolve both actual and potential claims the loss of a water right or a currently available water supply could force us to curtail operations or force premature closures thereby increasing andor accelerating costs or foregoing profitable operations 

at our north america operations certain of our water supplies are supported by surface water rights which give us the right to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location in arizona where our operations use both surface and groundwater we are a participant in an active general stream adjudication in which arizona courts have been attempting for over 40 years to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for the gila river one of the state’s largest river systems this stream adjudication primarily affects our morenci safford and sierrita mines the adjudication is addressing the state law claims of thousands of competing users including us as well as significant federal water claims that are potentially adverse to the state law claims of both surface water and groundwater users groundwater is treated differently from surface water under arizona law which historically allowed land owners to pump unlimited quantities of subsurface water subject only to the requirement of putting it to “reasonable use” however court decisions in the adjudication have concluded that some underground water constitutes “subflow” that is to be treated legally as surface water and is therefore subject to the arizona doctrine of prior appropriation and to the adjudication and potentially unavailable to groundwater pumpers in the absence of valid surface water claims any recharacterization of groundwater as surface water could affect the ability of consumers farmers ranchers municipalities and industrial users like us to continue to access water supplies that have been relied on for decades because we are a user of both groundwater and surface water in arizona we are an active participant in the adjudication proceeding 

in re the general adjudication of all rights to use water in the gila river system and sources  maricopa county superior court cause nos w1 salt w2 verde w3 upper gila and w4 san pedro this case was originally initiated in 1974 with the filing of a petition with the arizona state land department and was consolidated and transferred to the maricopa county superior court in 1981 the principal parties in addition to us include the state of arizona the gila valley irrigation district the franklin irrigation district the san carlos irrigation and drainage district the salt river project the san carlos apache tribe the gila river indian community gric and the us on behalf of those tribes on its own behalf and on behalf of the white mountain apache tribe the fort mcdowell mohaveapache indian community the salt river pimamaricopa indian community and the payson community of yavapai apache indians 

prior to january 1 1983 various indian tribes filed suits in the us district court in arizona claiming superior rights to water being used by many other parties including us and claiming damages for prior use in derogation of their allegedly superior rights these federal proceedings have been stayed pending the arizona superior court adjudications and some have been settled 

in 2005 the maricopa county superior court directed the arizona department of water resources adwr to prepare detailed recommendations regarding the delineation of the “subflow” zone of the san pedro river a tributary of the gila river underground water within the subflow zone is presumed to constitute appropriable subflow rather than groundwater although we have minimal interests in the san pedro river basin a decision that recharacterizes groundwater in that basin as appropriable surface water may set a precedent for other river systems in arizona that could have material implications for many commercial industrial municipal and agricultural users of groundwater including our arizona operations in 2017 the court approved adwr’s proposed subflow zone delineation no party has appealed that decision 

in 2014 adwr submitted a proposal for the development of procedures for “cone of depression” analyses to determine whether a well located outside of the subflow zone creates a cone of depression that intersects the subflow zone based on the cone of depression analyses wells outside of the subflow zone could be subject to the jurisdiction of the adjudication court in the absence of a valid surface water claim to support the pumping owners 

 53 

of wells deemed to be depleting the subflow zone through their cones of depression may be subject to claims that they must refrain from pumping or must pay damages in january 2017 adwr issued a report containing its recommended cone of depression test and a trial was held in march 2018 concerning adwr’s recommended action 

on november 14 2018 the court’s special master issued a final decision rejecting adwr’s recommended test instead adopting our position that a numeric model capable of accounting for complexities of the aquifer system should be used the special master also confirmed that this initial cone of depression test is for determining which wells are subject to the jurisdiction of the adjudication court not proving that a well is pumping subflow or establishing how much of a well’s production is subflow those matters will be determined by a subsequent “subflow depletion test” which has not yet been formulated our adversaries are expected to seek review of the special master’s november 2018 final decision objections must be filed with the superior court in may 2019 

in december 2018 adwr submitted its initial report on the “subflow depletion test” which will specify the methodology a well owner must use to quantify the portion of the water drawn from a well that is subflow as opposed to groundwater a status conference has been scheduled in february 2019 to identify issues to be addressed during this phase of the litigation and to discuss future case deadlines 

as part of the gila river adjudication the us has asserted numerous claims for express and implied “reserved” surface water and groundwater rights on indian and nonindian federal lands throughout arizona these claims are related to reservations of federal land for specific purposes  eg  indian reservations national parks military bases and wilderness areas unlike state lawbased water rights federal reserved water rights are given priority in the prior appropriation system based on the date the land was reserved not the date that water was first used on the land in addition federal reserved water rights if recognized by the court may enjoy greater protection from groundwater pumping than is accorded to state lawbased water rights 

in multiple instances the us asserts a right to all water in a particular watershed that was not effectively appropriated under state law prior to the establishment of the federal reservation this creates risks for both surface water users and groundwater users because such expansive claims may severely impede competing uses of water within the same watershed because there are numerous federal reservations in watersheds across arizona the reserved water right claims of the us pose a significant risk to multiple operations including morenci and safford in the upper gila river watershed and sierrita in the santa cruz watershed because federal reserved water rights may adversely affect water uses at each of these operations we have been actively involved in litigation over these claims because federal reserved water rights have not yet been quantified the task of determining how much water each federal reservation may use has been left to the gila river adjudication court several “contested cases” to quantify reserved water rights for particular federal reservations in arizona are currently pending in the adjudication and one was recently resolved that case in re aravaipa canyon wilderness area  was to resolve the us’s claims to water for the aravaipa canyon wilderness area the case was tried in 2015 and the court issued a decision in december 2018 supportive of our position on almost all issues including rejection of the government’s core argument that wilderness areas are entitled to all water that was not appropriated at the time the reservation was created we believe the rulings in this case will support our positions in other pending federal reserved right cases including these in re fort huachuca  which involves the us’s claims to water for an arizona army base and is awaiting a decision following a trial which concluded in february 2017   in re redfield canyon wilderness area  which involves the us’s claims to water for another wilderness area and is awaiting a decision following a trial which concluded in may 2017 and in re san pedro riparian national conservation area  which involves the us’s claims to water for a national conservation area which is currently in trial 

given the legal and technical complexity of these adjudications their long history and their longterm legal economic and political implications it is difficult to predict the timing or the outcome of these proceedings if we are not able satisfactorily resolve the issues being addressed in the adjudications our ability to pump groundwater could be diminished or curtailed and our operations at morenci safford and sierrita could be adversely affected unless we are able to acquire alternative resources

general 

we are a leading international mining company with headquarters in phoenix arizona our company was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware on november 10 1987 we operate large longlived geographically diverse assets with significant proven and probable reserves of copper gold and molybdenum and we are the world’s largest publicly traded copper producer our portfolio of assets includes the grasberg minerals district in indonesia one of the world’s largest copper and gold deposits and significant mining operations in the americas including the largescale morenci minerals district in north america and the cerro verde operation in south america 

we have taken actions to restore our balance sheet strength through a combination of asset sale and capital market transactions including 

 

 

 

 

these actions combined with cash flow from operations resulted in net reductions of debt totaling 29 billion  during 2017 and 43 billion  during 2016 refer to note 8  for discussion of debt and an increase in consolidated cash from 177 million  at december 31 2015 to 42 billion  at december 31 2016 and 44 billion  at december 31 2017 we continue to manage costs and capital spending and subject to commodity prices and operational results expect to generate significant operating cash flows for further debt reduction during 2018 

we believe the underlying longterm fundamentals of the copper business remain positive and we have retained a highquality portfolio of longlived copper assets positioned to generate longterm value we have commenced a project to develop the lone star oxide ores near the safford operation in eastern arizona we are also pursuing other opportunities to enhance net present values and we continue to advance studies for future development of our copper resources the timing of which will be dependent on market conditions

copper gold and molybdenum 

following provides a brief discussion of our primary natural resources – copper gold and molybdenum for further discussion of historical and current market prices of these commodities refer to mda and item 1a “risk factors” 

copper 

copper is an internationally traded commodity and its prices are determined by the major metals exchanges – the london metal exchange lme new york mercantile exchange nymex and shanghai futures exchange prices on these exchanges generally reflect the worldwide balance of copper supply and demand and can be volatile and cyclical during 2017  the lme spot copper price averaged 280  per pound ranging from a low of 248  per pound to a high of 327  per pound and was 325  per pound at december 31 2017  

in general demand for copper reflects the rate of underlying world economic growth particularly in industrial production and construction according to wood mackenzie a widely followed independent metals market consultant copper’s enduse markets and their estimated shares of total consumption are construction 30 percent consumer products 24 percent electrical applications 24 percent transportation 12 percent and industrial machinery 10 percent we believe copper will continue to be essential in these basic uses as well as contribute significantly to new technologies for energy efficiencies to advance communications and to enhance public health examples of areas we believe will require additional copper in the future include i high efficiency motors which consume up to 75 percent more copper than a standard motor ii electric vehicles which consume up to four times the amount of copper in terms of weight compared to vehicles of similar size with an internal combustion engine and require copperintensive charging station infrastructure to refuel and iii renewable energy 

 3 

such as wind and solar which consume four to five times the amount of copper compared to traditional fossil fuel generated power 

gold 

gold is used for jewelry coinage and bullion as well as various industrial and electronic applications gold can be readily sold on numerous markets throughout the world benchmark prices are generally based on london bullion market association london quotations during 2017  the london pm gold price averaged 1257  per ounce ranging from a low of 1151  per ounce to a high of 1346  per ounce and was 1297  per ounce at december 31 2017  

molybdenum 

molybdenum is a key alloying element in steel and the raw material for several chemicalgrade products used in catalysts lubrication smoke suppression corrosion inhibition and pigmentation molybdenum as a highpurity metal is also used in electronics such as flatpanel displays and in super alloys used in aerospace reference prices for molybdenum are available in several publications including metals week cru report and  metal bulletin  during 2017  the weekly average price of molybdenum quoted by metals week  averaged 821  per pound ranging from a low of 698  per pound to a high of 1015  per pound and was 1015  per pound at december 31 2017  

products and sales 

fcx’s consolidated revenues for 2017  primarily included sales of copper  74 percent  gold  12 percent  and molybdenum  5 percent  copper concentrate sales to pt smelting totaled 12 percent  of fcx’s consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2017  refer to note 16  for a summary of our consolidated revenues and operating income loss by business segment and geographic area 

copper products 

we are one of the world’s leading producers of copper concentrate cathode and continuous cast copper rod during 2017  59 percent  of our mined copper was sold in concentrate 19 percent  as cathode and 22 percent  as rod from north america operations 

the copper ore from our mines is generally processed either by smelting and refining or by solution extraction and electrowinning sxew before being subject to the smelting and refining process ore is crushed and treated to produce a copper concentrate with copper content of approximately 20 to 30 percent copper concentrate is then smelted  ie  subjected to extreme heat to produce copper anode which weighs between 800 and 900 pounds and has an average copper content of 995 percent the anode is further treated by electrolytic refining to produce copper cathode which weighs between 100 and 350 pounds and has an average copper content of 9999 percent for ore subject to the sxew process the ore is placed on stockpiles and copper is extracted from the ore by dissolving it with a weak sulphuric acid solution the copper content of the solution is increased in two additional solutionextraction stages and then the copperbearing solution undergoes an electrowinning process to produce cathode that is on average 9999 percent copper our copper cathode is used as the raw material input for copper rod brass mill products and for other uses 

copper concentrate  we produce copper concentrate at six of our mines in north america copper concentrate is produced at the morenci bagdad sierrita and chino mines and a significant portion is shipped to our miami smelter in arizona copper concentrate is also produced at the cerro verde mine in peru and the grasberg minerals district in indonesia

cerro verde is located in a desert environment with rainfall averaging 15 inches per year and is in an active seismic zone the highest bench elevation is 2750 meters above sea level and the ultimate pit bottom is expected to be 1570 meters above sea level the peruvian general mining law and cerro verde’s mining stability agreement grant the surface rights of mining concessions located on government land additional government land if obtained after 1997 must be leased or purchased cerro verde has a mining concession covering approximately 178000 acres including access to 14500 acres granted through an easement from the regional government of arequipa plus 212 acres of owned property and 367 acres of rightsofway outside the mining concession area 

cerro verde receives electrical power including hydrogenerated power under longterm contracts with kallpa generación sa electroperu and engie energia peru sa 

water for our cerro verde processing operations comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the rio chili watershed that collect water primarily from seasonal precipitation in 2015 cerro verde completed the construction of a wastewater treatment plant that intercepts raw sewage that would otherwise be discharged into the rio chili and processes it for both use at the cerro verde mine and for recharge of treated water into the rio chili we believe the cerro verde operation has sufficient water resources to support current operations for further discussion of risks associated with the availability of water see item 1a “risk factors” 

el abra 

we own a 51 percent interest in el abra and the remaining 49 percent interest is held by the stateowned copper enterprise corporación nacional del cobre de chile codelco 

el abra is an openpit copper mining complex that has been in operation since 1996 and is located 47 miles north of calama in chile’s el loa province region ii the site is accessible by paved highway and by rail 

the el abra mine is a porphyry copper deposit that has sulfide and oxide mineralization the predominant primary sulfide copper minerals are bornite and chalcopyrite there is a minor amount of secondary sulfide mineralization 

as chalcocite the oxide copper minerals are chrysocolla and pseudomalachite there are lesser amounts of copperbearing clays and tenorite 

the el abra operation consists of an openpit copper mine and a sxew facility with a capacity of 500 million pounds of copper cathode per year from a 125000 metric tonperday crushed leach circuit and a similarsized rom leaching operation the available fleet consists of twentytwo 266metric ton haul trucks loaded by four shovels with buckets ranging in size from 29 to 41 cubic meters which are capable of moving an average of 214000 metric tons of material per day 

 15 

el abra’s copper production totaled 173 million  pounds in 2017  220 million  pounds in 2016  and 324 million  pounds in 2015  beginning in the second half of 2015 el abra operated at reduced rates to achieve lower operating and labor costs defer capital expenditures and extend the life of the existing operations el abra is expected to operate at full capacity during 2018 

we continue to evaluate a major expansion at el abra to process additional sulfide material and to achieve higher recoveries exploration results in recent years at el abra indicate a significant sulfide resource which could potentially support a major mill project similar to facilities recently constructed at cerro verde future investments will be dependent on technical studies which are being advanced economic factors and market conditions 

el abra is located in a desert environment with rainfall averaging less than one inch per year and is in an active seismic zone the highest bench elevation is 4180 meters above sea level and the ultimate pit bottom is expected to be 3430 meters above sea level el abra controls a total of approximately 151300 acres of mining claims covering the ore deposit stockpiles process plant and water wellfield and pipeline in addition el abra has land surface rights for the road between the processing plant and the mine the water wellfield power transmission lines and for the water pipeline from the salar de ascotán aquifer 

el abra currently receives electrical power under a longterm contract with engie energia chile sa water for our el abra processing operations comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascotán aquifer pursuant to regulatory approval we believe el abra has sufficient water rights and regulatory approvals to support current operations for a discussion of risks associated with the availability of water refer to item 1a “risk factors” 

indonesia 

ownership  ptfi is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the republic of indonesia we directly own 8128 percent of the outstanding common stock of ptfi and indirectly own 936 percent through our wholly owned subsidiary pt indocopper investama in late 2017 the indonesian government transferred its 936 percent ownership interest in ptfi to pt indonesia asahan aluminium inalum a stateowned enterprise that is owned 100 percent by the indonesian government 

ptfi has an unincorporated joint venture with rio tinto under which rio tinto has a 40 percent interest in certain assets and future production exceeding specified annual amounts of copper gold and silver through 2022 in block a of ptfi’s contract of work cow and after 2022 a 40 percent interest in all production from block a the block a area is where all of ptfi’s proven and probable mineral reserves and all of its current mining operations are located refer to note 3  for further discussion of the joint venture agreement 

 16 

contract of work  ptfi conducts its current exploration and mining operations in indonesia through a cow with the indonesian government the cow governs our rights and obligations relating to taxes exchange controls royalties repatriation and other matters and was concluded pursuant to the 1967 foreign capital investment law which expresses indonesia’s foreign investment policy and provides basic guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization a framework for economic incentives and basic rules regarding other rights and obligations of foreign investors specifically the cow provides that the indonesian government will not nationalize or expropriate ptfi’s mining operations any disputes regarding the provisions of the cow are subject to international arbitration 

ptfi’s original cow was entered into in 1967 and was replaced by the current cow in 1991 the initial term of the current cow expires in 2021 but the cow explicitly provides that it can be extended for two 10year periods subject to indonesian government approval which pursuant to the cow cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably the cow allows us to conduct exploration mining and production activities in the 24700acre block a area under the cow ptfi has rights to conduct exploration activities in the block b area currently covering 502000 acres 

under the cow ptfi pays royalties on copper gold and silver in the concentrate it sells a large part of the mineral royalties under indonesian government regulations is designated to the provinces from which the minerals are extracted in connection with its fourth concentrator mill expansion completed in 1998 ptfi agreed to pay the indonesian government additional royalties which were not required by the cow to provide further support to the local governments and to the people of the indonesian province of papua additionally under a memorandum of understanding mou entered into with the indonesian government in july 2014 ptfi agreed to increase royalty rates ptfi’s royalties totaled 173 million  in 2017  131 million  in 2016  and 114 million  in 2015  refer to note 13  for further discussion of ptfi’s royalty rates 

regulatory matters  following the issuance of new regulations by the indonesian government in early 2017 which resulted in a temporary suspension of ptfi’s concentrate exports ptfi entered into a mou in april 2017 confirming that the cow would continue to be valid and honored until replaced by a mutually agreed iupk and investment stability agreement 

following a framework understanding reached in august 2017 the parties have been engaged in negotiation and documentation of a special mining license iupk and accompanying documentation for assurances on legal and fiscal terms to replace the cow while providing ptfi with longterm mining rights through 2041 in addition the iupk would provide that ptfi construct a smelter within five years of reaching a definitive agreement and include agreement for the divestment of 51 percent of the project area interests to indonesian participants at fair market value the parties continue to negotiate documentation on a comprehensive agreement for ptfi’s extended operations and to reach agreement on timing process and governance matters relating to the divestment with a mutual objective of completing negotiations and the required documentation during the first half of 2018 

  

in december 2017 ptfi was granted an extension of its temporary iupk through june 30 2018 to enable exports to continue while negotiations on a definitive agreement proceed in february 2018 ptfi received an extension of its export license through february 15 2019 

until a definitive agreement is reached ptfi has reserved all rights under its cow including dispute resolution procedures we cannot predict whether ptfi will be successful in reaching a satisfactory agreement on the terms of its longterm mining rights if ptfi is unable to reach a definitive agreement with the indonesian government on its longterm mining rights we intend to reduce or defer investments significantly in underground development projects and will pursue dispute resolution procedures under the cow refer to note 13  and item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion of these regulatory matters and risks associated with operations in indonesia 

grasberg minerals district  ptfi operates in the remote highlands of the sudirman mountain range in the province of papua indonesia which is on the western half of the island of new guinea we and our predecessors have been the only operator of exploration and mining activities in block a since 1967 

the grasberg minerals district has three operating mines the grasberg open pit the deep ore zone doz underground mine and the big gossan underground mine in september 2015 ptfi initiated precommercial production which represents ore extracted during the development phase for the purpose of obtaining access to the ore body at the deep mill level zone dmlz underground mine 

 17 

as further discussed in mda ptfi also has several projects in progress in the grasberg minerals district related to the development of the largescale longlived highgrade underground ore bodies located beneath and nearby the grasberg open pit in aggregate these underground ore bodies are expected to produce largescale quantities of copper and gold following the transition from the grasberg open pit substantial progress has been made to prepare for the transition to mining of the grasberg block cave underground mine mine development activities are sufficiently advanced to commence caving in early 2019 the ore flow system and underground rail line are expected to be installed during 2018 

ptfi’s production including our joint venture partner’s share totaled 10 billion  pounds of copper and 16 million  ounces of gold in 2017  11 billion  pounds of copper and 11 million  ounces of gold in 2016  and 752 million  pounds of copper and 12 million  ounces of gold in 2015  

our principal source of power for all our indonesian operations is a coalfired power plant that we built in 1998 diesel generators supply peaking and backup electrical power generating capacity a combination of naturally occurring mountain streams and water derived from our underground operations provides water for our operations our indonesian operations are in an active seismic zone and experience average annual rainfall of approximately 200 inches 

grasberg open pit 

ptfi began openpit mining of the grasberg ore body in 1990 and is currently mining the final phase of the grasberg open pit which contains high copper and gold ore grades ptfi expects to mine highgrade ore over the next several quarters prior to transitioning to the grasberg block cave underground mine in the first half of 2019 production from the ore stockpiles which are located outside of the pit limits is expected to continue through the end of 2019 production in the open pit is currently at the 3200 to 3400meter elevation level and totaled 37 million metric tons of ore in 2017  which provided 72 percent of ptfi’s 2017  mill feed 

the current openpit equipment fleet consists of over 500 units the larger mining equipment directly associated with production includes an available fleet of 99 haul trucks with payloads of 218 metric tons and 15 shovels with bucket sizes ranging from 17 to 42 cubic meters which are capable of moving an average of 340000 metric tons of material per day 

crushing and conveying systems are integral to the grasberg mine and provide the capacity to transport more than 250000 metric tons of ore per day ore milled from the grasberg open pit averaged 101800  metric tons per day in 2017  119700  metric tons per day in 2016  and 115900  metric tons per day in 2015  

doz underground mine 

the doz ore body lies vertically below the now depleted intermediate ore zone ptfi began production from the doz ore body in 1989 using openstope mining methods but suspended production in 1991 in favor of production from the grasberg open pit production resumed in september 2000 using the blockcave method and is at the 3110meter elevation level 

the doz is a mature blockcave mine that previously operated at 80000 metric tons of ore per day current operating rates from the doz underground mine are driven by the value of the incremental doz ore grade compared to the ore from the grasberg open pit and ore grade material from the development of the dmlz and grasberg block cave underground mines ore milled from the doz underground mine averaged 31200  metric tons of ore per day in 2017 38000  metric tons of ore per day in 2016 and 43700  metric tons of ore per day in 2015 production at the doz underground mine is expected to continue through 2021 

the doz mine fleet consists of 159 pieces of mobile equipment the primary mining equipment directly associated with production and development includes an available fleet of 45 lhd units and 22 haul trucks each production lhd unit typically carries approximately 11 metric tons of ore using ore passes and chutes the lhd units transfer ore into 55metric ton capacity haul trucks the trucks dump into two gyratory crushers and the ore is then conveyed to the surface stockpiles for processing 

the success of the development of the doz mine one of the world’s largest underground mines provides confidence in the future development of ptfi’s largescale underground ore bodies 

 18 

dmlz underground mine 

the dmlz ore body lies below the doz underground mine at the 2590meter elevation and represents the downward continuation of mineralization in the ertsberg east skarn system and neighboring ertsberg porphyry ore milled from the dmlz underground mine averaged 3200  metric tons of ore per day in 2017  4400  metric tons per day in 2016 and 2900  metric tons per day in 2015 during 2017 and late january 2018 the dmlz underground mine was impacted by mininginduced seismic activity which is not uncommon in block cave mining to mitigate the impact of these events ptfi implemented a revised mine sequence upgraded support systems blasting and reentry protocols and improved mine monitoring and analysis processes development activities and mining are taking place in unaffected areas while impacted areas are being assessed rehabilitated and prepared to be placed back into use targeted production rates once the dmlz underground mine reaches full capacity are expected to approximate 80000 metric tons of ore per day in 2021 production at the dmlz underground mine is expected to continue through 2041 

the dmlz mine fleet consists of over 230 pieces of mobile equipment which includes 27 lhd units and 15 haul trucks used in production and development activities 

big gossan underground mine 

the big gossan underground mine was on careandmaintenance status during most of 2017 and production restarted in fourthquarter   2017  the big gossan mine lies underground and adjacent to the current mill site it is a tabular near vertical ore body with approximate dimensions of 1200 meters along strike and 800 meters down dip with varying thicknesses from 20 meters to 120 meters the mine utilizes a blasthole stoping method with delayed paste backfill stopes of varying sizes are mined and the ore dropped down passes to a truck haulage level trucks are chute loaded and transport the ore to a jaw crusher the crushed ore is then hoisted vertically via a twoskip production shaft to a level where it is loaded onto a conveyor belt the belt carries the ore to one of the main underground conveyors where the ore is transferred and conveyed to the surface stockpiles for processing 

the big gossan mine fleet consists of over 72 pieces of mobile equipment which includes 9 lhd units and 9 haul trucks used in development and production activities 

description of ore bodies   our indonesia ore bodies are located within and around two main igneous intrusions the grasberg monzodiorite and the ertsberg diorite the host rocks of these ore bodies include both carbonate and clastic rocks that form the ridge crests and upper flanks of the sudirman range and the igneous rocks of monzonitic to dioritic composition that intrude them the igneoushosted ore bodies the grasberg open pit and block cave and portions of the doz block cave occur as vein stockworks and disseminations of copper sulfides dominated by chalcopyrite and to a lesser extent bornite the sedimentaryrock hosted ore bodies portions of the doz and all of the big gossan occur as “magnetiterich calciummagnesian skarn” replacements whose location and orientation are strongly influenced by major faults and by the chemistry of the carbonate rocks along the margins of the intrusions 

the copper mineralization in these skarn deposits is dominated by chalcopyrite but higher bornite concentrations are common moreover gold occurs in significant concentrations in all of the district’s ore bodies though rarely visible to the naked eye these gold concentrations usually occur as inclusions within the copper sulfide minerals though in some deposits these concentrations can also be strongly associated with pyrite

smelting facilities and other mining properties 

atlantic copper  our wholly owned atlantic copper smelter and refinery is located on land concessions from the huelva spain port authorities which are scheduled to expire in 2027 

the design capacity of the smelter is approximately 295000 metric tons of copper per year and the refinery has a capacity of 285000 metric tons of copper per year atlantic copper produced 283100 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 271400 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2017  296900 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 285800 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2016 and 293100 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 284800 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2015 

following is a summary of atlantic copper’s concentrate purchases from third parties and our copper mining operations for the years ended december 31 



atlantic copper’s major maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately every eight years with shorterterm maintenance turnarounds in the interim atlantic copper completed a 68day major maintenance turnaround in 2013 and a 27day maintenance turnaround in 2017 the next 14day maintenance turnaround is scheduled for 2019 

pt smelting  ptfi’s cow required us to construct or cause to be constructed a smelter in indonesia if we and the indonesian government determined that such a project would be economically viable in 1995 following the completion of a feasibility study we entered into agreements relating to the formation of pt smelting an indonesian company and the construction of the copper smelter and refinery in gresik indonesia pt smelting owns and operates the smelter and refinery ptfi owns 25 percent of pt smelting with the remainder owned by mitsubishi materials corporation 605 percent mitsubishi corporation rtm japan ltd 95 percent and jx nippon mining  metals corporation 5 percent 

ptfi’s contract with pt smelting requires ptfi to supply 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements at market rates subject to a minimum or maximum treatment charge rate necessary for pt smelting to produce 205000 metric tons of copper annually on a priority basis ptfi may also sell copper concentrate to pt smelting at market rates for quantities in excess of 205000 metric tons of copper annually ptfi supplied 93 percent  of pt smelting’s concentrate requirements in 2017 88 percent  in 2016 and 80 percent  in 2015 

in early 2017 the indonesian government issued new regulations to address exports of unrefined metals including copper concentrate and anode slimes and other matters related to the mining sector these regulations permit the export of anode slimes which is necessary for pt smelting to continue operating as a result of labor disturbances and a delay in the renewal of its export license for anode slimes pt smelting’s operations were shut down from midjanuary 2017 until early march 2017 in march 2017 pt smelting’s anode slimes export license was renewed through march 1 2018  on february 15 2018 pt smelting submitted an application to renew its export license 

pt smelting produced 245800 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 247800 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2017  255700 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 241700 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2016 and 199700 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 198400 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2015 following a temporary suspension in july 2015 pt smelting operated at approximately 80 percent capacity from september 2015 to november 2015 when required repairs of an acid plant cooling tower that was damaged during the suspension were completed 

pt smelting’s maintenance turnarounds which range from two weeks to a month to complete typically are expected to occur approximately every two years with shortterm maintenance turnarounds in the interim pt smelting completed a 25day maintenance turnaround during 2016 and the next major maintenance turnaround is scheduled for thirdquarter 2018 

miami smelter  we own and operate a smelter at our miami mining operation in arizona the smelter has been operating for approximately 100 years and has been upgraded numerous times during that period to implement new 

 21 

technologies improve production and comply with air quality requirements the miami smelter has completed the installation of emission control equipment that will allow it to operate in compliance with air quality standards effective in 2018 refer to item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

the miami smelter processes copper concentrate primarily from our north america copper mines concentrate processed through the smelter totaled 612600 metric tons in 2017  673300 metric tons in 2016 and 686700 metric tons in 2015 in addition because sulphuric acid is a byproduct of smelting concentrate the miami smelter is also the most significant source of sulphuric acid for our north america leaching operations 

major maintenance turnarounds which take approximately three weeks to complete are anticipated to occur approximately every three years for the miami smelter with shortterm maintenance turnarounds in the interim the miami smelter completed a major maintenance turnaround in secondquarter 2017 and the next major maintenance turnaround is scheduled for 2020   

rod  refining operations  our rod  refining operations consist of conversion facilities located in north america including a refinery in el paso texas rod mills in el paso texas norwich connecticut and miami arizona and a specialty copper products facility in bayway new jersey we refine our copper anode production from our miami smelter at our el paso refinery the el paso refinery has the potential to operate at an annual production capacity of about 900 million pounds of copper cathode which is sufficient to refine all of the copper anode we produce at our miami smelter our el paso refinery also produces nickel carbonate copper telluride and autoclaved slimes material containing gold silver platinum and palladium 

molybdenum conversion facilities  we process molybdenum concentrate at our conversion plants in the us and europe into such products as technicalgrade molybdic oxide ferromolybdenum pure molybdic oxide ammonium molybdates and molybdenum disulfide we operate molybdenum roasters in sierrita arizona fort madison iowa and rotterdam the netherlands and we operate a molybdenum pressureleach plant in bagdad arizona we also produce ferromolybdenum for customers worldwide at our conversion plant located in stowmarket united kingdom 

freeport cobalt  in march 2013 we acquired a cobalt chemical refinery in kokkola finland and the related sales and marketing business which provided direct endmarket access for the cobalt hydroxide production at the tenke mine the joint venture operates under the name freeport cobalt and we are the operator with an effective 56 percent ownership interest the remaining effective ownership interest is held by lundin mining corporation 24 percent and la générale des carrières et des mines 20 percent the kokkola refinery has an annual refining capacity of approximately 15000 metric tons of cobalt 

as further discussed in note 2  fcx expects to sell its interest in freeport cobalt which is classified as held for sale at december 31 2017 

other north america copper mines  we also have five nonoperating copper mines – ajo bisbee tohono twin buttes and christmas which are located in arizona – that have been on careandmaintenance status for several years and would require new or updated environmental studies new permits and additional capital investment which could be significant to return them to operating status 

mining development projects and exploration 

capital expenditures for mining operations totaled 14 billion  including 09 billion  for major projects in 2017  16 billion  including 12 billion  for major projects in 2016  and 33 billion  including 24 billion  for major projects in 2015  capital expenditures for major projects during the three years ended december 31 2017  were primarily associated with the cerro verde expansion project and ongoing underground development activities at grasberg refer to mda for projected capital expenditures for the year 2018 if ptfi is unable to reach a definitive agreement with the indonesian government on its longterm mining rights we intend to reduce or defer investments significantly in underground development projects and will pursue dispute resolution procedures under ptfi’s cow 

  

we have several projects and potential opportunities to expand production volumes extend mine lives and develop largescale underground ore bodies as further discussed in mda our nearterm major development projects primarily include the underground development activities in the grasberg minerals district and development of the lone star oxide project considering the longterm nature and large size of our development projects actual costs and timing could vary from estimates additionally in response to market conditions and indonesian regulatory 

 22 

uncertainty the timing of our expenditures will continue to be reviewed as further discussed in “mining operations  indonesia” ptfi also committed to commence construction of a new smelter during a five year timeframe after obtaining an investment stability agreement providing equivalent rights with the same level of legal and fiscal certainty provided under ptfi’s cow refer to item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion of indonesia regulatory matters we continue to review our mine development and processing plans to maximize the value of our mineral reserves 

we also have an additional longterm underground mine development project in the grasberg minerals district for the kucing liar ore body which lies on the southern flank of and underneath the southern portion of the grasberg open pit at the 2605meter elevation level we expect to mine the kucing liar ore body using the blockcave method aggregate capital cost estimates for development of the kucing liar ore body are projected to approximate 26 billion which are expected to be made between 2019 and 2031 additionally our current mine development plans include approximately 57 billion of capital expenditures at our processing facilities to optimize the handling of underground ore types once the grasberg openpit operations cease we expect substantially all of these expenditures to be made between 2019 and 2034 the timing and development of this project is currently being reviewed 

our mining exploration activities are generally associated with our existing mines focusing on opportunities to expand reserves and resources to support development of additional future production capacity exploration results continue to indicate opportunities for significant future potential reserve additions in north america and south america exploration spending associated with mining operations totaled 72 million  in 2017  44 million in 2016  and 82 million in 2015  exploration spending is expected to approximate 65 million  for the year 2018  

sources and availability of energy natural resources and raw materials 

our copper mining operations require significant energy principally diesel electricity coal and natural gas most of which is obtained from third parties under longterm contracts energy represented 18 percent  of our copper mine site operating costs in 2017  including purchases of approximately 196 million  gallons of diesel fuel 7900  gigawatt hours of electricity at our north america and south america copper mining operations we generate all of our power at our indonesia mining operation 700 thousand  metric tons of coal for our coal power plant in indonesia and 1 million  mmbtu million british thermal units of natural gas at certain of our north america mines based on current cost estimates energy will approximate 20 percent  of our copper mine site operating costs in 2018  

our mining operations also require significant quantities of water for mining ore processing and related support facilities the loss of water rights for any of our mines in whole or in part or shortages of water to which we have rights could require us to curtail or shut down mining operations for a further discussion of risks and legal proceedings associated with the availability of water refer to item 1a “risk factors” and item 3 “legal proceedings” 

sulphuric acid is used in the sxew process and is produced as a byproduct of the smelting process at our smelters and from our sulfur burners at the safford mine sulphuric acid needs in excess of the sulphuric acid produced by our operations are purchased from third parties 

community and human rights 

we have adopted policies that govern our working relationships with the communities where we operate and are designed to guide our practices and programs in a manner that respects human rights and the culture of the local people impacted by our operations we continue to make significant expenditures on community development education training and cultural programs which include 

 

 23 

in december 2000 we endorsed the joint us state departmentbritish foreign office voluntary principles on human rights and security voluntary principles we participated in developing these voluntary principles with other major natural resource companies and international human rights organizations and they are incorporated into our human rights policy the voluntary principles provide guidelines for our security programs including interaction with hostgovernment security personnel private security contractors and our internal security employees 

in february 2015 we updated our human rights policy to align our due diligence practices with the united nations guiding principles on business and human rights un guiding principles and in august 2017 we updated our human rights policy to reflect our full commitment to the un guiding principles we have embarked on a program to plan and conduct sitelevel human rights impact assessments hria at operations with higher potential risks hrias help us to embed human rights considerations into our business practices including sitelevel sustaintable development risk registers in 2017 we completed a hria at our cerro verde operation in peru we also participate in a multiindustry human rights working group to gain insight from peer companies 

we believe that our social and economic development programs are responsive to the issues raised by the local communities near our areas of operation and help us maintain good relations with the surrounding communities and avoid disruptions of mining operations as part of our ongoing commitment to sustainable community development we make significant investments in social programs including inkind support and administration across our global operations over the last five years these investments have averaged 166 million per year nevertheless social and political instability in the areas of our operations may adversely impact our mining operations refer to item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

south america  cerro verde has provided a variety of community support projects over the years following engagements with regional and local governments civic leaders and development agencies in 2006 cerro verde committed to support the costs for a new potable water treatment plant to serve arequipa in addition an agreement was reached with the peruvian government for development of a water storage network that was financed by cerro verde and a distribution network that was financed by the cerro verde civil association 

cerro verde reached an agreement with the regional government of arequipa the national government sedapar and other local institutions to allow it to finance engineer and construct a wastewater treatment plant for the city of arequipa which was completed in 2015 the wastewater treatment plant supplements existing water supplies to support cerro verde’s concentrator expansion and also improves the local water quality enhances agriculture products grown in the area and reduces the risk of waterborne illnesses in addition to these projects cerro verde annually makes significant community development investments in the arequipa region 

security matters  consistent with our operating permits in peru and our commitment to protect our employees and property we have taken steps to provide a safe and secure working environment as part of its security program cerro verde maintains its own internal security department both employees and contractors perform functions such as protecting company facilities monitoring shipments of supplies and products assisting in traffic control and aiding in emergency response operations the security department receives human rights and voluntary principles training annually some contractors assigned to protection of expatriate personnel are armed these contractors also receive training in defensive driving and firearms handling cerro verde’s costs for its internal civilian security department totaled 8 million in 2017 and 6 million in both 2016 and 2015 

cerro verde like all businesses and residents of peru relies on the peruvian government for the maintenance of public order upholding the rule of law and the protection of personnel and property the peruvian government is responsible for employing police personnel and directing their operations cerro verde has limited public security forces in support of its operation with the arrangement defined through an mou with the peruvian national police cerro verde’s share of support costs for governmentprovided security approximated 1 million in each of the years 2017 2016 and 2015 

indonesia  in 1996 ptfi established the freeport partnership fund for community development the partnership fund through which ptfi has made available funding and technical assistance to support community development initiatives in the areas of health education and economic development ptfi has committed through 2018 to provide one percent of its annual revenue for the development of the local people in its area of operations through the partnership fund ptfi recognized 44 million  in 2017  33 million  in 2016  and 27 million  in 2015  for this commitment

the amungme and kamoro community development organization  lembaga pengembangan masyarakat amungme dan kamoro  or lpmak oversees disbursement of the program funds we contribute to the partnership fund lpmak is governed by a board of commissioners and a board of directors which are comprised of representatives from the local amungme and kamoro tribal communities government leaders church leaders and one representative of ptfi on each board the amungme and kamoro people are original inhabitants of the land in our area of operations in addition to the partnership fund ptfi annually makes significant investments in public health education community infrastructure and economic development 

security matters    consistent with our cow in indonesia and our commitment to protect our employees and property we have taken steps to provide a safe and secure working environment as part of its security program ptfi maintains its own internal security department both employees and contractors are unarmed and perform functions such as protecting company facilities monitoring shipments of supplies and products assisting in traffic control and aiding in emergency response operations the security department receives human rights training annually 

ptfi’s share of costs for its internal civilian security department totaled 54 million in 2017  and 58 million for both 2016  and 2015  

ptfi and all businesses and residents of indonesia rely on the indonesian government for the maintenance of public order upholding the rule of law and the protection of personnel and property the grasberg minerals district has been designated by the indonesian government as one of indonesia’s vital national assets this designation results in the police and to a lesser extent the military playing a significant role in protecting the area of our operations the indonesian government is responsible for employing police and military personnel and directing their operations 

from the outset of ptfi’s operations the indonesian government has looked to ptfi to provide logistical and infrastructure support and assistance for these necessary services because of the limited resources of the indonesian government and the remote location of and lack of development in papua ptfi’s financial support for the indonesian government security institutions assigned to the operations area represents a prudent response to its requirements to protect its workforce and property better ensuring that personnel are properly fed and lodged and have the logistical resources to patrol ptfi’s roads and secure its operating area in addition the provision of such support is consistent with ptfi’s obligations under the cow reflects our philosophy of responsible corporate citizenship and is in keeping with our commitment to pursue practices that will promote human rights 

ptfi’s share of support costs for the governmentprovided security was 23 million in 2017  20 million in 2016  and 21 million in 2015  this supplemental support consists of various infrastructure and other costs such as food housing fuel travel vehicle repairs allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs and community assistance programs conducted by the military and police

mineral reserves 

recoverable proven and probable reserves have been calculated in accordance with industry guide 7 as required by the securities exchange act of 1934 proven and probable reserves may not be comparable to similar information regarding mineral reserves disclosed in accordance with the guidance in other countries proven and probable reserves were determined by the use of mapping drilling sampling assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry as more fully discussed below the term “reserve” as used in the reserve data presented here means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination the term “proven reserves” means reserves for which i quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops trenches workings or drill holes ii grade andor quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and iii the sites for inspection sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established the term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced the degree of assurance although lower than that for proven reserves is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 

our mineral reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies we conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk we revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies 

estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves at december 31 2017  were determined using 200  per pound for copper 1000  per ounce for gold and 10  per pound for molybdenum for the threeyear period ended december 31 2017  lme spot copper prices averaged 250  per pound london pm gold prices averaged 1223  per ounce and the weekly average price for molybdenum quoted by metals week  averaged 712  per pound in late 2015 we incorporated changes in the commercial pricing structure for our molybdenumbased chemical products to enable continuation of chemicalgrade production 

the recoverable proven and probable reserves presented in the table below represent the estimated metal quantities from which we expect to be paid after application of estimated metallurgical recovery rates and smelter recovery rates where applicable recoverable reserves are that part of a mineral deposit that we estimate can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination

in defining our openpit reserves we apply a “variable cutoff grade” strategy the objective of this strategy is to maximize the net present value of our operations we use a “breakeven cutoff grade” to define the insitu reserves for our underground ore bodies the breakeven cutoff grade is defined for a metric ton of ore as that equivalent copper grade once produced and sold that generates sufficient revenue to cover all operating and administrative costs associated with our production 

our copper mines may contain other commercially recoverable metals such as gold molybdenum and silver we value all commercially recoverable metals in terms of a copper equivalent percentage to determine a single cutoff grade copper equivalent percentage is used to express the relative value of multimetal ores in terms of one metal the calculation expresses the relative value of the ore using estimates of contained metal quantities metals prices as used for reserve determination recovery rates treatment charges and royalties our molybdenum properties use a molybdenum cutoff grade 

the table below shows the minimum cutoff grade by process for each of our existing ore bodies as of december 31 2017

drill hole spacing data is used by mining professionals such as geologists and geological engineers in determining the suitability of data coverage on a relative basis in a given deposit type and mining method scenario so as to achieve a given level of confidence in the resource estimate drill hole spacing is only one of several criteria necessary to establish resource classification drilling programs are typically designed to achieve an optimum sample spacing to support the level of confidence in results that apply to a particular stage of development of a mineral deposit 

the following table sets forth the average drill hole spacing based on average sample distance or drill pattern spacing for proven and probable ore reserves by process type 



 32 

production sequencing 

the following chart illustrates our current plans for sequencing and producing our proven and probable reserves at each of our ore bodies and the years in which we currently expect production from each ore body and from related stockpiles the chart also shows the term of ptfi’s cow production volumes are typically lower in the first few years for each ore body as development activities are ongoing and as the mine ramps up to full production and production volumes may also be lower as the mine reaches the end of its life the sequencing dates shown in the chart below include development activity that results in metal production the ultimate timing of the start of production from our undeveloped mines is dependent upon a number of factors including the results of our exploration and development efforts and may vary from the dates shown below in addition we develop our mine plans based on maximizing the net present value from the ore bodies significant additional capital expenditures will be required at many of these mines in order to achieve the lifeofmine plans reflected below 

mill and leach stockpiles 

mill and leach stockpiles generally contain lower grade ores that have been extracted from an ore body and are available for copper recovery mill stockpiles contain sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through milling concentrating smelting and refining or alternatively by concentrate leaching leach stockpiles contain oxide ores and certain secondary sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities 

because it is impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count reasonable estimation methods are employed the quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grades of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles 

 33 

expected copper recovery rates for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing the recoverable copper in mill stockpiles once entered into the production process can be produced into copper concentrate almost immediately 

expected copper recovery rates for leach stockpiles are determined using smallscale laboratory tests small to largescale column testing which simulates the production process historical trends and other factors including mineralogy of the ore and rock type total copper recovery in leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low percentage to more than 90 percent depending on several variables including processing methodology processing variables mineralogy and particle size of the rock for newly placed material on active stockpiles as much as 80 percent of total copper recovery may be extracted during the first year and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years processes and recovery rates are monitored regularly and recovery rate estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes 

following are our stockpiles and the estimated recoverable copper contained within those stockpiles as of december 31 2017  

 

mineralized material 

we hold various properties containing mineralized material that we believe could be brought into production should market conditions warrant however permitting and significant capital expenditures would be required before operations could commence at these properties mineralized material is a mineralized body that has been delineated by appropriately spaced drilling andor underground sampling to support the reported tonnage and average metal grades such a deposit cannot qualify as recoverable proven and probable reserves until legal and economic feasibility are confirmed based upon a comprehensive evaluation of development costs unit costs grades recoveries and other material factors estimated mineralized materials as presented on the following page were assessed using prices of 220  per pound for copper 1000  per ounce for gold 12  per pound for molybdenum and 20 per ounce for silver

oil and gas operations 

as further discussed in note 2  during 2016 and 2017 we completed the sales of substantially all of our oil and gas properties including our deepwater gulf of mexico gom onshore california and haynesville oil and gas properties and property interests in the gom shelf and the madden area in central wyoming as a result our portfolio of oil and gas assets includes oil and natural gas production onshore in south louisiana and on the gom shelf and oil production offshore california which had estimated proved developed reserves of 101 million  barrels of oil equivalents mmboe at december 31 2017  

exploration and development activities 

during 2017 capital expenditures associated with oil and gas properties totaled 34 million primarily associated with changes in capital expenditure accruals we have no plans to incur significant capital expenditures associated with oil and gas properties in future periods capital expenditures for our oil and gas operations totaled 12 billion  in 2016  including 06 billion  incurred for gom and 05 billion  for changes in capital expenditure accruals and 30 billion  in 2015 including 26 billion incurred for gom 

production and sales data 

for the year 2017 oil and gas sales were not material and totaled 46 mmboe the following table presents oil and gas production and sales data for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 





productive wells 

 at december 31 2017  the total number of active producing oil and gas wells was not significant at december 31 2016  we had working interests in 120 gross 94 net active producing oil wells and 640 gross 100 net active producing natural gas wells at december 31 2015  we had working interests in 3060 gross 2976 net active producing oil wells and 1759 gross 213 net active producing natural gas wells

this report contains “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of united states us federal securities laws forwardlooking statements are all statements other than statements of historical facts such as projections or expectations relating to ore grades and milling rates production and sales volumes unit net cash costs operating cash flows anticipated tax refunds resulting from us tax reform capital expenditures exploration efforts and results development and production activities and costs liquidity tax rates the impact of copper gold and molybdenum price changes the impact of deferred intercompany profits on earnings reserve estimates future dividend payments and share purchases and sales 

we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements we caution readers that forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated projected or assumed in the forwardlooking statements important factors that can cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements include the following 

financial risks 

fluctuations in the market prices of copper gold and molybdenum have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in our financial performance and in the trading prices of our debt and common stock extended declines in the market prices of copper gold and to a lesser extent molybdenum could adversely affect our earnings cash flows and asset values and if sustained may adversely affect our ability to repay debt 

our financial results will vary with fluctuations in the market prices of the commodities we produce primarily copper and gold and to a lesser extent molybdenum an extended decline in market prices of these commodities could have a material adverse effect on our financial results the value of our assets andor our ability to repay our debt and meet our other fixed obligations and may depress the trading prices of our common stock and of our publicly traded debt securities 

additionally if market prices for our primary commodities decline for a sustained period of time we may have to revise our operating plans including curtailing production reducing operating costs and capital expenditures and discontinuing certain exploration and development programs we may be unable to decrease our costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues in which case we may incur losses and those losses may be material 

fluctuations in commodities prices are caused by varied and complex factors beyond our control including global supply and demand balances and inventory levels global economic and political conditions international regulatory 

 37 

trade and tax policies commodities investment activity and speculation the price and availability of substitute products and changes in technology 

copper prices may be affected by demand from china which has become the largest consumer of refined copper in the world and by changes in demand for industrial commercial and residential products containing copper copper prices have fluctuated historically with london metal exchange lme spot copper prices ranging from 196  per pound to 327  per pound during the three years ended december 31 2017  lme spot copper prices averaged 280  per pound in 2017 221 per pound in 2016 and 249 per pound in 2015 the lme spot copper price was 325  per pound on december 31 2017  and 322  per pound on january 31 2018  

factors affecting gold prices may include the relative strength of the us dollar to other currencies inflation and interest rate expectations purchases and sales of gold by governments and central banks demand from china and india two of the world ’ s largest consumers of gold and global demand for jewelry containing gold the london pm gold price averaged 1257  per ounce in 2017 1250 per ounce in 2016 and 1160 per ounce in 2015 the london pm gold price was 1297  per ounce on december 31 2017  and 1345  per ounce on january 31 2018  

the metals week  molybdenum dealer oxide weekly average price averaged 821  per pound in 2017 647 per pound in 2016 and 666 per pound in 2015 the metals week  molybdenum dealer oxide weekly average price was 1015  per pound on december 31 2017  and 1187  per pound on january 31 2018  

as further discussed in notes 4  and 5  noncash charges for inventory adjustments totaled 8 million  in 2017 and 36 million  in 2016 primarily for molybdenum and 338 million  in 2015 for copper and molybdenum and longlived mining asset impairments totaled 37 million  in 2015 declines in copper gold andor molybdenum prices could result in additional metals inventory adjustments and impairment charges for our longlived assets other events that could result in impairment of our longlived assets include but are not limited to decreases in estimated proven and probable mineral reserves and any event that might have a material adverse effect on mine production costs 

our debt and other financial commitments may limit our financial and operating flexibility 

at december 31 2017  our total consolidated debt was  131 billion  see note 8  and our total consolidated cash was 44 billion  we also have various other financial commitments including reclamation and environmental obligations takeorpay contracts and leases for further information refer to the risk factor below relating to mine closure and reclamation regulations and plugging and abandonment obligations related to our remaining oil and gas properties our level of indebtedness and other financial commitments could have important consequences to our business including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

any failure to comply with the financial and other covenants in our debt agreements may result in an event of default that would allow the creditors to accelerate maturities of the related debt which in turn may trigger crossacceleration or crossdefault provisions in other debt agreements our available cash and liquidity may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our debt instruments that are accelerated upon an event of default 

from august 2015 through november 2016 we sold 3265 million shares of our common stock under registered atthemarket equity programs which generated 35 billion in gross proceeds refer to note 10  in addition during 2016 we issued 481 million  shares of our common stock in connection with the settlement of two drilling rig 

 38 

contracts refer to note 13  and 277 million  shares of our common stock in exchange for 369 million  of fcx senior notes refer to note 10  any additional issuance of equity capital to fund operations reduce debt improve our financial position or for other purposes may have a negative impact on our stock price 

as of january 31 2018  our senior unsecured debt was rated “bb“ with a stable outlook by standard  poor’s sp “bb” with a negative outlook by fitch ratings fitch and “ba2” with a stable outlook by moody’s investors service moody’s there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not be downgraded in the future 

mine closure and reclamation regulations impose substantial costs on our operations and include requirements that we provide financial assurance supporting those obligations we also have plugging and abandonment obligations related to our remaining oil and gas properties and are required to provide bonds or other forms of financial assurance in connection with those properties   changes in or the failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us 

we are required by us federal and state laws and regulations to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans for our mining properties if we are unable to do so the us environmental protection agency epa and state agencies may also require financial assurance for investigation and remediation actions that are required under settlements of enforcement actions under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 cercla or similar state laws refer to note 12  for additional information regarding our financial assurance obligations 

with respect to our mining operations most of our financial assurance obligations are imposed by state laws that vary significantly by jurisdiction depending on how each state regulates land use and groundwater quality although section 108b of cercla has required epa to identify classes of facilities that must establish evidence of financial responsibility since it was adopted in 1980 currently there are no financial assurance requirements for active mining operations under cercla in august 2014 several environmental organizations initiated litigation against epa to require it to set a schedule for adopting financial assurance regulations under cercla governing the hard rock mining industry epa and the environmental organizations reached a joint agreement and submitted it to the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit for approval notwithstanding industry objections the court approved the agreement on january 29 2016 thereby requiring epa to propose financial assurance regulations for the hard rock mining industry by december 1 2016 and to provide notice of its final action by december 1 2017 the proposed regulations were published on january 11 2017 and the public comment period closed on july 11 2017 the proposed rules were vigorously opposed by the mining industry other industry commenters and states and other federal agencies that have mine closure and reclamation programs we and others in the industry submitted comments to inform epa that if adopted without material modification the rules would impose financial responsibility obligations on us hard rock mining operations that are unnecessary duplicative of existing state and other federal requirements and unreasonable our initial calculations also suggested that the financial responsibility amounts would be difficult if not impossible for us and others to meet with corporate resources and would be extremely expensive if not impossible to finance with thirdparty financial instruments such as letters of credit bonds or insurance on december 1 2017 epa announced that it was withdrawing its proposed rules and would not issue any final financial assurance regulations for the hard rock mining industry epa indicated that its decision was based on its interpretation of the statute and analysis of its record developed for this rule making including comments on federal and state regulatory controls governing the hard rock mining sector and federal and state financial responsibility requirements environmental organizations have announced that they will file suit challenging epa’s decision after the final decision has been published in the federal register we and others in the industry will continue to participate in the legal process and oppose any reproposal of rules similar to what epa proposed on december 1 2016 as a reproposal of similar rules would severely harm the international competitiveness of the us hard rock mining industry and would materially and adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

we are also subject to financial assurance requirements in connection with our remaining oil and gas properties under both state and federal laws including financial responsibility required under the oil pollution act of 1990 to cover containment and cleanup costs resulting from an oil spill in 2016 the us bureau of ocean energy management boem issued revised requirements for lessees operating in federal waters to secure the cost of plugging abandoning decommissioning andor removing wells platforms and pipelines at the end of production the revised requirements eliminate previously provided waivers from requirements to post security in early 2017 the boem announced a delay in the implementation of certain aspects of the rules pending further review the boem has been discussing the rules with industry representatives and implementation remains on hold at this time if implemented the new requirements could require us to post security in the form of bonds or similar 

 39 

assurances the cost for bonds or other forms of assurances can be substantial and there is no assurance that they can be obtained in all cases 

as of december 31 2017  our financial assurance obligations totaled 12 billion  for closure and reclamationrestoration costs of us mining sites and 06 billion  for plugging and abandonment obligations of our remaining oil and gas properties refer to note 12  a substantial portion of our financial assurance obligations are satisfied by fcx and subsidiary guarantees and financial capability demonstrations our ability to continue to provide guarantees and financial capability demonstrations depends on state and other regulatory requirements our financial performance and our financial condition other forms of assurance such as letters of credit and surety bonds are costly to provide and depending on our financial condition and market conditions may be difficult or impossible to obtain failure to provide the required financial assurance could result in the closure of the affected properties 

refer to notes 1  and 12  for further discussion of our environmental and asset retirement obligations 

unanticipated litigation or negative developments in pending litigation or with respect to other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

we are involved in numerous legal proceedings and subject to other contingencies that have arisen or may arise in the ordinary course of our business or are associated with environmental issues arising from legacy operations conducted over the years by freeport minerals corporation fmc and its affiliates including those described in note 12  and in item 3 “legal proceedings” involving matters such as remediation restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination claims of personal injury or property damage arising from such contamination or from exposure to substances such as lead arsenic asbestos talc and other allegedly toxic substances disputes over water rights and disputes with foreign governments or regulatory authorities over royalties taxes rights and obligations under concession or other agreements or other matters we are also involved periodically in other reviews inquiries   investigations and other proceedings initiated by or involving government agencies some of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief in addition from time to time we are involved in disputes over the allocation of environmental remediation obligations at superfund and other sites the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant monetary damages penalties other sanctions or injunctive relief against us limitations on our property rights or regulatory interpretations that increase our operating costs management does not believe based on currently available information that the outcome of any individual legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition although individual or cumulative outcomes could be material to our operating results for a particular period depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period 

with respect to the asbestos exposure cases described in note 12  there has been an increase in the number of cases against fmc and certain affiliates alleging exposure to talc contaminated with asbestos and to talc that is not alleged to be contaminated with asbestos there have been a number of large jury awards in single plaintiff cases primarily brought by consumers against makers of common consumer products containing talc and alleging serious health risks including mesothelioma and ovarian cancer allegedly associated with longterm use of such products prior affiliates were involved in talc mining and some of those affiliates have been named as defendants in some of those cases we have indemnification rights against a successor to those businesses and the successor has acknowledged those indemnification obligations subject to certain reservations and has taken responsibility for all cases we have tendered to it however the indemnitor may have limited financial resources and limited amounts of insurance available to meet those obligations 

international risks 

our international operations are subject to political social and geographic risks of doing business in countries outside the us 

we are a usbased mining company with substantial assets located outside of the us we conduct international mining operations in indonesia peru and chile accordingly in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in countries outside the us our business may be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties in each of these countries 

 40 

risks of conducting business in countries outside of the us include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our insurance does not cover most losses caused by the above described risks accordingly our exploration development and production activities outside of the us may be substantially affected by many unpredictable factors beyond our control some of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

our international operations must comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption and antibribery laws of the other jurisdictions in which we operate there has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of these laws in recent years any violation of those laws could result in significant criminal or civil fines and penalties litigation and loss of operating licenses or permits and may damage our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

we are involved in several significant tax proceedings and other tax disputes with the indonesian and peruvian tax authorities refer to note 12  for further discussion of these matters other risks specific to certain countries in which we operate are discussed in more detail below 

because our grasberg mining operation in indonesia is a significant operating asset our business may continue to be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties in indonesia 

our mining operations in indonesia are conducted by our subsidiary pt freeport indonesia ptfi pursuant to a contract of work cow with the indonesian government maintaining a good working relationship with the indonesian government is important to us because of the significance of our indonesia operations to our business and because our mining operations there are among indonesia’s most significant business enterprises partially because of their significance to indonesia’s economy the environmentally sensitive area in which they are located and the number of people employed our indonesia operations have been the subject of political debates and of criticism in the indonesian press and have been the target of protests and occasional violence for further discussion of the history of ptfi’s cow refer to note 13  

the initial term of ptfi’s cow expires in 2021 but the cow explicitly provides that it can be extended for two 10year periods subject to indonesian government approval which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably ptfi has been engaged in discussions with officials of the indonesian government since 2012 regarding various provisions of its cow including extending its term notwithstanding provisions in the cow prohibiting it from doing so the indonesian government has sought to modify existing mining contracts including ptfi’s cow to address 

 41 

provisions contained in the mining law enacted in 2009 and mining regulations adopted thereunder including provisions that conflict with the cow such as the size of contract concessions government revenues domestic processing of minerals divestment provision of local goods and services conversion from a cow to a licensing framework for extension periods and a requirement that extensions may be applied for only within two years prior to a cow’s expiration 

  

regulations published pursuant to the 2009 mining law in january 2014 imposed among other things a progressive export duty on copper concentrate and restricted exports of copper concentrate and anode slimes a byproduct of the copper refining process containing metals including gold after january 12 2017 despite ptfi’s rights under its cow to export concentrate without the payment of duties ptfi was unable to obtain administrative approval for exports and operated at approximately half of its capacity from midjanuary 2014 through july 2014 

in july 2014 ptfi entered into a memorandum of understanding mou with the indonesian government in which subject to concluding an agreement to extend ptfi’s operations beyond 2021 on acceptable terms ptfi agreed to construct new smelter capacity in indonesia and to divest an additional 2064 percent interest at fair value under the mou ptfi provided a 115 million assurance bond to support its commitment for smelter development agreed to pay higher royalty rates and agreed to pay export duties until certain smelter development milestones were met the mou also anticipated an amendment of the cow within six months to address other matters in january 2015 the mou was extended to july 25 2015 and it expired on that date the indonesian government has continued to impose the increased royalty rates export duties and smelter assurance bond 

in october 2015 the indonesian government provided a letter of assurance to ptfi indicating that it would revise regulations allowing it to approve the extension of ptfi’s operations beyond 2021 and provide the same rights and the same level of legal and fiscal certainty provided under the current cow 

in january and february 2017 the indonesian government issued new regulations pursuant to the 2009 mining law to address exports of unrefined metals including copper concentrate and anode slimes and other matters related to the mining sector the new regulations permit the continuation of copper concentrate exports for a fiveyear period through january 2022 subject to various conditions including conversion from a contract of work to a special mining license known as an iupk which does not provide the same level of fiscal and legal protections as ptfi’s cow which remains in effect a commitment to the completion of smelter construction in five years and payment of export duties to be determined by the ministry of finance in addition the new regulations enable application for extension of mining rights five years before expiration of the iupk and require foreign iupk holders to divest 51 percent to indonesian interests no later than the tenth year of production export licenses would be valid for oneyear periods subject to review every six months depending on smelter construction progress 

following the issuance of the january and february 2017 regulations and discussions with the indonesian government ptfi advised the government that it was prepared to convert its cow to an iupk subject to extension of its longterm mining rights to 2041 and obtaining an investment stability agreement providing contractual rights with the same level of legal and fiscal certainty provided under its cow and provided that the cow would remain in effect until it is replaced by a mutually satisfactory alternative ptfi also committed to commence construction of a new smelter during a fiveyear time frame after approval of the extension of its longterm mining rights 

on january 12 2017 ptfi suspended exports in response to indonesian regulations in effect at the time in addition as a result of labor disturbances and a delay in the renewal of its export license for anode slimes pt smelting’s ptfi’s 25percentowned copper smelter and refinery located in gresik indonesia operations were shut down from midjanuary 2017 until early march 2017 on february 10 2017 ptfi was forced to suspend production as a result of limited storage capacity at ptfi and pt smelting on april 21 2017 the indonesian government issued a permit to ptfi that allowed exports to resume for a sixmonth period and ptfi commenced export shipments 

in midfebruary 2017 pursuant to the cow’s dispute resolution provisions ptfi provided formal notice to the indonesian government of an impending dispute listing the government’s breaches and violations of the cow as described in the risk factor below “ptfi’s cow may be subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations and if a dispute arises we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of an international arbitration panel” 

 42 

as a result of the 2017 regulatory restrictions and uncertainties regarding longterm investment stability ptfi took actions to adjust its cost structure slow investments in its underground development projects and new smelter and place certain of its workforce on furlough programs 

in late march 2017 the indonesian government amended the regulations to enable ptfi to retain its cow until replaced with an iupk accompanied by an investment stability agreement and to grant ptfi a temporary iupk in april 2017 ptfi entered into a mou with the indonesian government confirming that the cow would continue to be valid and honored until replaced by a mutually agreed iupk and investment stability agreement in the mou ptfi agreed to continue to pay a 50 percent export duty during this period subsequently the customs office of the minister of finance refused to recognize the 50 percent export duty under the mou and imposed a 75 percent export duty under the ministry of finance regulations since resuming exports on april 21 2017 ptfi has paid the 75 percent export duty under protest while the matter is pending in indonesia tax court proceedings 

following a framework understanding reached in august 2017 the parties have engaged in negotiation and documentation of a special mining license and accompanying documentation for assurances on legal and fiscal terms to replace the cow while providing ptfi with longterm mining rights through 2041 in addition the iupk would provide that ptfi would construct a new smelter in indonesia within five years of reaching a definitive agreement and include agreement for the divestment of 51 percent of the project area interests to indonesian participants at fair market value execution of a definitive agreement will require approval by our board of directors the board and our joint venture partner rio tinto plc rio tinto as well as the modification or revocation of current regulations and the implementation of new regulations by the indonesian government 

in late 2017 the indonesian government including the regional government of papua province and mimika regency and pt indonesia asahan aluminium inalum a stateowned enterprise which will lead the government’s consortium of investors agreed to form a special purpose company to acquire grasberg project area interests inalum is wholly owned by the indonesian government and currently holds 936 percent of ptfi’s outstanding common stock we are engaged in discussions with inalum and rio tinto regarding potential arrangements that would result in the inalum consortium acquiring interests that would meet the indonesian government’s 51 percent ownership objective in a manner satisfactory to all parties and in a structure that would provide for continuity of our management of ptfi’s operations and governance of the business the parties continue to negotiate documentation on a comprehensive agreement for ptfi’s extended operations and to reach agreement on timing process and governance matters relating to the divestment the parties have a mutual objective of completing negotiations and the required documentation during the first half of 2018 

  

in december 2017 ptfi was granted an extension of its temporary iupk through june 30 2018 to enable exports to continue while negotiations on a definitive agreement proceed in february 2018 ptfi received an extension of its export license through february 15 2019 on february 15 2018 pt smelting submitted an application to renew its anode slimes export license which expires march 1 2018  

until a definitive agreement is reached ptfi has reserved all rights under its cow including dispute resolution procedures we cannot predict whether ptfi will be successful in reaching a satisfactory agreement on the terms of its longterm mining rights if ptfi is unable to reach a definitive agreement with the indonesian government on its longterm rights we intend to reduce or defer investments significantly in underground development projects which would have a material adverse effect on our future production cash flow results of operations and financial position and could result in asset impairments inventory write downs difficulty in meeting covenants under our credit facilities and a significant reduction in our reported mineral reserves 

in 2018 indonesia will hold elections for legislators at the provincial and district levels including the province of papua and mimika regency and national legislative elections will be held in 2019 the presidential election will be held in april 2019 with a runoff in august 2019 if required political considerations leading up to these elections could impact our progress in reaching a definitive agreement with the indonesian government on our longterm rights and the outcome of these elections could affect the country’s policies pertaining to foreign investment

ptfi’s cow may be subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations and if a dispute arises we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of an international arbitration panel 

ptfi’s cow was entered into under indonesia’s 1967 foreign capital investment law which provides guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization the cow may be subject to termination by the indonesian government if we do not satisfy our contractual obligations which include the payment of royalties and taxes to the government and the satisfaction of certain mining environmental safety and health requirements 

recently adopted indonesian laws and regulations conflict with the mining rights established under the cow although the cow grants to ptfi the unencumbered right to operate in accordance with the cow government agencies have sought and continue to seek to impose additional restrictions on ptfi that could affect exploration and operating requirements for further discussion refer to the above risk factor “because our grasberg mining operation in indonesia is a significant operating asset our business may continue to be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties in indonesia” 

ptfi’s cow requires that disputes with the indonesian government be submitted to international arbitration in midfebruary 2017 pursuant to the cow’s formal dispute resolution provisions ptfi provided formal notice to the indonesian government of an impending dispute listing the government’s breaches and violations of the cow including but not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if the dispute is not resolved ptfi may commence arbitration under the united nations commission on international trade law arbitration rules to enforce all provisions of the cow and seek damages specifically in respect of the issuance of the january 11 2017 regulations which are not in accordance with honoring the contractual commitments of the indonesian government and ptfi under the cow the arbitration proceedings would take place in jakarta indonesia and for limited purposes would be overseen by the indonesian courts under the indonesian arbitration act the international arbitration process is complex and could take considerable time to complete and there is no assurance that we will prevail if we prevail we will face the additional risk of having to enforce the judgment of an international arbitration panel against indonesia within its own territory additionally our operations may be materially and adversely affected while resolution of a dispute is pending 

at times certain government officials and others in indonesia have questioned the validity of contracts entered into by the indonesian government prior to may 1998  ie  during the suharto regime which lasted over 30   years including ptfi’s cow which was signed in december 1991 we cannot provide assurance that the validity of or our compliance with the cow will not be challenged for political or other reasons 

we will not mine all of our ore reserves in indonesia before the initial term of our cow expires 

our proven and probable ore reserves in indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041 and our current mine plan and planned operations are based on the assumption that we will receive the two 10year extensions as a result we will not mine all of these ore reserves during the initial term of the current cow prior to the end of 2021 we expect to mine 12 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable ore at december 31 2017  representing 18 percent of ptfi’s share of recoverable copper reserves and 29 percent of its share of recoverable gold reserves there can be no assurance that the indonesian government will approve our cow extensions for further discussion refer to the above risk factors “because our 

 44 

grasberg mining operation in indonesia is a significant operating asset our business may continue to be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties in indonesia” and “ptfi’s cow may be subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations and if a dispute arises we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of an international arbitration panel” 

operational risks 

our mining operations are subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our business 

our mines are very large in scale and by their nature are subject to significant operational risks some of which are outside of our control and many of which are not covered fully or in some cases even partially by insurance these operational risks which could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and cash flow include earthquakes rainstorms floods and other natural disasters equipment failures accidents wall failures and rock slides in our openpit mines and structural collapses of our underground mines or tailings impoundments and lower than expected ore grades or recovery rates 

the waste rock including overburden and tailings produced in our mining operations represent our largest volume of waste material managing the volume of waste rock and tailings presents significant environmental safety and engineering challenges and risks we maintain large leach pads and tailings impoundments containing viscous material which are effectively large dams that must be engineered constructed and monitored to assure structural stability and avoid leakages or structural collapse our tailings impoundments in arid areas must have effective programs to suppress fugitive dust emissions and we must effectively monitor and treat acid rock drainage at all of our operations in indonesia we use a river transport system for tailings management which presents other risks as discussed below 

the failure of tailings and other impoundments at any of our mining operations could cause severe property and environmental damage and loss of life and we apply significant financial resources and both internal and external technical resources to the effective safe management of all those facilities the importance of careful design management and monitoring of large impoundments was emphasized in recent years by large scale tailings dam failures at unaffiliated mines which caused extensive property and environmental damage and resulted in the loss of life our tailing stewardship program which involves designated engineers of record and periodic oversight by external tailing review boards at numerous operations complies with the tailings governance framework adopted in december 2016 by international council on mining and metals we continue to augment our existing practices in an effort to reduce the risk of catastrophic failure of tailings storage facilities 

labor unrest violence activism and civil and religious strife could disrupt our operations and may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

as of december 31 2017  approximately 40 percent of our global labor force was covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 15 percent of our global labor force was covered by agreements that have expired and are currently being negotiated or will expire during 2018 

labor agreements are negotiated on a periodic basis and may not be renewed on reasonably satisfactory terms to us or at all if we do not successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements with our union workers we may incur prolonged strikes and other work stoppages at our mining operations which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations additionally if we enter into a new labor agreement with any union that significantly increases our labor costs relative to our competitors our ability to compete may be materially and adversely affected refer to items 1 and 2 “business and properties” for additional information regarding labor matters and expiration dates of such agreements 

we could also experience labor disruptions such as work stoppages work slowdowns union organizing campaigns strikes or lockouts that could adversely affect our operations for example during thirdquarter 2016 ptfi experienced labor productivity issues and a 10day work stoppage that began in late september 2016 these labor productivity issues continued during fourthquarter 2016 and the first half of 2017 significant reductions in productivity or protracted work stoppages at one or more of our operations could significantly reduce our production and sales volumes which could adversely affect our cash flow results of operations and financial condition 

indonesia has long faced separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces several separatist groups have sought increased political independence for the province of papua where our grasberg 

 45 

minerals district is located in papua there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the indonesian military and police in addition illegal miners have periodically clashed with police who have attempted for years to move them away from our facilities social economic and political instability in papua could materially and adversely affect us if it results in damage to our property or interruption of our indonesia operations 

in 2009 a series of shooting incidents occurred within the ptfi project area including along the road leading to our mining and milling operations the shooting incidents continued on a sporadic basis through january 11 2015 during this time there were 20 fatalities and 59 injuries to our employees contractor employees government security personnel and civilians the next shooting incident occurred in august 2017 and a series of shooting incidents has continued on a sporadic basis through february 16 2018 from august 2017 through february 16 2018 there have been 24 shooting incidents within the ptfi project area and five shooting incidents in nearby areas which resulted in 16 injuries to ptfi’s workforce and one civilian injury additionally during law enforcement actions government security personnel incurred seven injuries and two fatalities the safety of our workforce is a critical concern and ptfi continues to work with the indonesian government to address security issues the investigation of these incidents is ongoing we also continue to limit the use of the road leading to our mining and milling operations to secured convoys including transport of personnel by armored vehicles in designated areas 

we cannot predict whether additional incidents will occur that could disrupt or suspend our indonesian operations if other disruptive incidents occur they could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in ways that we cannot predict at this time 

our mining operations depend on the availability of secure water supplies 

our mining operations require physical availability and secure legal rights to significant quantities of water for mining and ore processing activities and related support facilities most of our north america and south america mining operations are in areas where competition for water supplies is significant continuous production at our mines is dependent on many factors including our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies 

in arizona where our operations use both surface and ground water we are a participant in an active general stream adjudication in which the arizona courts have been attempting for over 40 years to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for the gila river one of the state’s largest river systems which primarily affects our morenci safford and sierrita mines the adjudication is addressing the state law claims of thousands of competing users including us as well as significant federal water claims that are potentially adverse to the state law claims of both surface water and groundwater users groundwater is treated differently from surface water under arizona law which historically allowed landowners to pump subsurface water subject only to the requirement of putting it to “reasonable use” however court decisions in the adjudication have concluded that underground water is often hydrologically connected to surface water so that it actually is surface water and is therefore subject to the arizona doctrine of prior appropriation as a result of which it would be subject to the adjudication and potentially unavailable to groundwater pumpers in the absence of valid surface water claims which historic groundwater pumpers typically do not have any recharacterization of groundwater as surface water could affect the ability of consumers farmers ranchers municipalities and industrial users like us to continue to access water supplies that have been relied on for decades because we are a user of both groundwater and surface water in arizona we are an active participant in the adjudication proceeding 

water for our cerro verde operation in peru comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the rio chili watershed that collects water primarily from seasonal precipitation as a result of occasional drought conditions temporary supply shortages are possible that could affect our cerro verde operations in january 2016 the peruvian government declared a temporary state of emergency with respect to the water supply in the rio chili basin because of drought conditions as a result the cerro verde water rights from the rio chili were temporarily decreased during february 2016 

water for our el abra mining operation in chile comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascotán aquifer in 2010 el abra obtained regulatory approval for the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascotán aquifer for its sulfide processing plant which began operations in 2011 the agreement to pump from this aquifer is subject to continued monitoring of the aquifer level to ensure that environmentally sensitive areas are not impacted by our pumping if impact occurs we would have to reduce pumping to restore water levels which could have an adverse effect on production from el abra 

 46 

although we typically have sufficient water for our indonesian operations lower rainfall could affect our water supply availability from time to time 

although each of our mining operations currently has access to sufficient water supplies to support current operational demands as discussed above some supplies are subject to adjudication proceedings the outcome of which we cannot predict and the availability of additional supplies that may be required for potential future expansions is uncertain while we are taking actions to acquire additional backup water supplies such supplies may not be available at acceptable cost or at all so that the loss of a water right or currently available water supply could force us to curtail operations or force premature closures thereby increasing andor accelerating costs or foregoing profitable operations 

in addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry our indonesia mining operations involve additional risks because they are located in very remote areas and on unusually difficult terrain 

the grasberg minerals district is located in steep mountainous terrain in a remote area of indonesia these conditions have required us to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities in addition the area receives considerable rainfall which has led to periodic floods and mudslides the mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time our insurance may not sufficiently cover an unexpected natural or operating disaster 

underground mining operations can be particularly dangerous and in may 2013 a tragic accident which resulted in 28 fatalities and 10 injuries occurred at ptfi when the rock structure above the underground ceiling of a training facility collapsed ptfi temporarily suspended mining and processing activities at the grasberg complex to conduct inspections and resumed openpit mining and concentrating activities on june 24 2013 and underground operations on july 9 2013 no assurance can be given that similar events will not occur in the future 

we must continually replace reserves depleted by production but our exploration activities may not result in additional discoveries 

our existing mineral reserves will be depleted over time by production from our operations because our profits are primarily derived from our mining operations our ability to replenish our mineral reserves is essential to our longterm success our exploration projects involve many risks require substantial expenditures and may not result in the discovery of additional deposits that can be produced profitably we may not be able to discover enhance develop or acquire reserves in sufficient quantities to maintain or grow our current reserve levels which could negatively affect our cash flow results of operations and financial condition 

development projects are inherently risky and may require more capital than anticipated which could adversely affect our business 

consolidated capital expenditures are expected to approximate 21 billion  for 2018 including 12 billion  for major projects primarily associated with underground development activities in the grasberg minerals district and development of the lone star oxide project refer to the risk factor “because our grasberg mining operation in indonesia is a significant operating asset our business may continue to be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties in indonesia” for further discussion of regulatory matters in indonesia that may impact future investments in ptfi’s underground development projects 

there are many risks and uncertainties inherent in all development projects the economic feasibility of development projects is based on many factors including the accuracy of estimated reserves estimated capital and operating costs and estimated future prices of the relevant commodity the capital expenditures and time required to develop new mines or other projects are considerable and changes in costs or timing can adversely affect project economics 

new development projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future cash flow the actual costs production rates and economic returns of our development projects may differ materially from our estimates which may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

 47 

our operations are subject to extensive regulations some of which require permits and other approvals these regulations increase our costs and in some circumstances may delay or suspend our operations 

our operations are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations that are subject to change and to changing interpretation by governmental agencies and other bodies vested with broad supervisory authority as a natural resource company compliance with environmental legal requirements is an integral and costly part of our business for additional information see “environmental risks” below we are also subject to extensive regulation of worker health and safety including the requirements of the us occupational safety and health act and similar laws of other jurisdictions in the us the operation of our mines is subject to regulation by the us mine safety and health administration msha under the federal mine safety and health act of 1977 msha inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred if such inspections result in an alleged violation we may be subject to fines and penalties and in instances of alleged significant violations our mining operations could be subject to temporary or extended closures 

many other governmental bodies regulate other aspects of our operations and our failure to comply with these legal requirements can result in substantial penalties in addition new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations by courts or regulatory authorities occur regularly but are difficult to predict any such variations could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow results of operations and financial condition 

our business may be adversely affected by information technology disruptions 

cybersecurity incidents are increasing in frequency evolving in nature and include but are not limited to installation of malicious software unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data we have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past and may experience them in the future we believe we have implemented appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks however given the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of information technology disruptions we could be subject to manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow results of operations and financial condition 

environmental risks 

our operations are subject to complex evolving and increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations compliance with environmental regulatory requirements involves significant costs and may constrain existing operations or expansion opportunities 

our operations both in the us and internationally are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing the generation storage treatment transportation and disposal of hazardous substances solid waste disposal air emissions wastewater discharges remediation restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination including mine closures and reclamation well plug and abandonment requirements protection of endangered and protected species and designation of critical habitats and other related matters in addition we must obtain regulatory permits and approvals to start continue and expand operations 

our miami arizona smelter processes approximately half of the aggregate copper concentrate produced by our north america copper mines epa regulations required us to invest approximately 230 million in new pollution control equipment to reduce sulfur dioxide so 2  to meet both regional haze requirements and to allow the state of arizona to demonstrate compliance with epa’s so 2  ambient air quality standards the new so 2 pollution control equipment was operational as of the january 1 2018 deadline imposed by epa we also obtained regulatory approvals to increase the smelter’s annual throughput to one million tons of copper concentrate which has the additional benefit of increasing the production of sulphuric acid for use in our copper leach operations 

laws such as cercla and similar state laws may expose us to joint and several liability for environmental damages caused by our operations or by previous owners or operators of properties we acquired or are currently operating or at sites where we sent materials for processing recycling or disposal as discussed in more detail in the next risk factor we have substantial obligations for environmental remediation on mining properties previously owned or operated by fmc and certain of its affiliates noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in material penalties or other liabilities in addition compliance with these laws may from time to time result in delays in or changes to our development or expansion plans compliance with these laws and regulations imposes 

 48 

substantial costs which we expect will continue to increase over time because of increased regulatory oversight adoption of increasingly stringent environmental standards as well as other factors 

new or revised environmental regulatory requirements are frequently proposed many of which result in substantially increased costs for our business including those regarding financial assurance in the financial risk factor above in addition in 2015 epa promulgated rules that could reclassify certain mineral processing materials as “hazardous waste” under the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and subject the industry to significant new and costly waste management requirements these rules were challenged by multiple parties in court in a decision issued in 2017 the court agreed in significant part with the challenges raised by the industry parties and vacated key parts of the rule governing when hazardous process materials are considered “discarded” and therefore subject to regulation as solid waste under rcra and epa regulatory pronouncements 

epa has also adopted rules that bring remote “tributaries” into the regulatory definition of “waters of the united states” that are protected by the clean water act thereby imposing significant additional restrictions on land uses in remote areas with only tenuous connections to active waterways these rules adopted in 2015 were challenged by multiple states and industry parties epa has moved forward to rescind these rules even as litigation challenging them is ongoing on february 6 2018 epa published a final notice delaying the effective date of these rules to february 2020 which will allow it time to reconsider the definition of “waters of the united states” this final notice has been challenged by states and environmental groups in the meantime epa intends to administer the regulations in place prior to the 2015 rules and has asked for input on how it should define the scope of the clean water act in future rulemaking 

regulations have been considered at various governmental levels to increase federal financial responsibility requirements both for mine closure and reclamation and for oil and gas decommissioning adoption of these or similar new environmental regulations or more stringent application of existing regulations may materially increase our costs threaten certain operating activities and constrain our expansion opportunities 

in february 2016 the department of the interior’s fish  wildlife service fws adopted final rules that broaden the regulatory definitions of “critical habitat” and “destruction or adverse modification” both of which are integral to the fws’s implementation of the endangered species act which protects federallylisted endangered and threatened species the new rules increase fws’s discretion to limit uses of land and water courses that may become suitable habitat for listed species in the future or that are occasionally used by protected species the new rules may limit the ability of landowners including us to obtain federal permits or authorizations needed for expansion of our operations and may also affect our ability to obtain retain or deliver water to some operations in november 2016 the new rules were challenged in court by a coalition of states in 2017 the department of interior indicated that it intends to reconsider these rules as part of its plans to modernize the implementation of the endangered species act also in 2017 the fws withdrew certain proposed designations of critical habitat affecting our properties 

we incurred environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs including our joint venture partners’ shares to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect our operations totaling 05 billion  in 2017 and 04 billion  in each of 2016 and 2015 for 2018  we expect to incur approximately 05 billion  of aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs the timing and amounts of estimated payments could change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements changes in scope and costs of reclamation and plug and abandonment activities the settlement of environmental matters and the rate at which actual spending occurs on continuing matters 

we incur significant costs for remediating environmental conditions on properties that have not been operated in many years 

fmc and its subsidiaries and many of their affiliates and predecessor companies have been involved in exploration mining milling smelting and manufacturing in the us for more than a century activities that occurred in the late 19th century and the 20th century prior to the advent of modern environmental laws were not subject to environmental regulation and were conducted before american industrial companies fully understood the longterm effects of their operations on the surrounding environment 

with the passage of cercla in 1980 companies like fmc became legally responsible for remediating hazardous substances released into the environment from properties owned or operated by them as well as properties where they arranged for disposal of such substances irrespective of when the release to the environment occurred or who 

 49 

caused it that liability is often asserted on a joint and several basis with other prior and subsequent owners operators and arrangers meaning that each owner or operator of the property is and each arranger may be held fully responsible for the remediation although in many cases some or all of the other responsible parties no longer exist do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found as a result because of our acquisition of fmc in 2007 many of the subsidiary companies we now own are potentially responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the us and we expect to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those remediation issues we are also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources at december 31 2017  we had more than 100  active remediation projects in 26  us states in addition fmc and certain affiliates and predecessor companies were parties to agreements relating to the transfer of businesses or properties that contained indemnification provisions relating to environmental matters and from time to time these provisions become the source of claims against us 

at december 31 2017  we had 14 billion  recorded in our consolidated balance sheet for environmental obligations attributable to cercla or analogous state programs and for estimated future costs associated with environmental matters at closed facilities or closed portions of operating facilities our environmental obligation estimates are primarily based upon 

 

 

 

significant adjustments to these estimates are likely to occur in the future as additional information becomes available the actual environmental costs may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs and any such changes could be material 

in addition remediation standards imposed by epa and state environmental agencies have generally become more stringent over time and may become even more stringent in the future imposition of more stringent remediation standards particularly for arsenic and lead in soils poses a risk that additional remediation work could be required at our active remediation sites and at sites that we have already remediated to the satisfaction of the responsible governmental agencies and may increase the risk of toxic tort litigation 

refer to note 12  for further discussion of our environmental obligations 

our indonesia mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges and future changes in environmental laws or unanticipated environmental impacts from those operations could require us to incur increased costs 

mining operations on the scale of our indonesia operations involve significant environmental risks and challenges our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of crushed and ground rock material called tailings that results from the process by which we physically separate the copper gold and silverbearing materials from the ore that we mine our tailings management plan which has been approved by the indonesian government uses the unnavigable river system in the highlands near our mine to transport the tailings to an engineered area in the lowlands where the tailings and natural sediments are managed in a deposition area lateral levees have been constructed to help contain the footprint of the tailings and to limit their impact in the lowlands 

another major environmental challenge is managing overburden which is the rock that must be moved aside in the mining process to reach the ore in the presence of air water and naturally occurring bacteria some overburden can generate acid rock drainage or acidic water containing dissolved metals that if not properly managed can adversely affect the environment in addition overburden stockpiles are subject to erosion caused by the large amounts of rainfall with the eroded stockpile material eventually being deposited in the lowlands tailings management area this additional material while predicted in our environmental studies influences the deposition of finer tailings material in the estuary 

 50 

in october 2017 indonesia’s ministry of environment and forestry the ministry notified ptfi of administrative sanctions related to certain activities the ministry indicated are not reflected in its environmental permit the ministry also notified ptfi that certain operational activities were inconsistent with factors set forth in its environmental permitting studies and that additional monitoring and improvements need to be undertaken related to air quality water drainage treatment and handling of certain wastes and tailings management ptfi has been engaged in a process to update its permits through submissions and dialogue with the ministry which began in late 2014 ptfi believes that it has submitted the required documentation to update its permits and is in the process of addressing other points raised by the ministry 

from time to time certain indonesian government officials have raised questions with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans including a suggestion that we implement a pipeline system rather than the river transport system for tailings management and disposition because our indonesia mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area a pipeline system would be costly difficult to construct and maintain and more prone to catastrophic failure and could therefore involve significant potentially adverse environmental issues based on our own studies and others conducted by third parties we do not believe that a pipeline system is necessary or practical 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change issues may increase our costs and adversely   affect our operations 

our copper mining operations require significant energy principally diesel electricity coal and natural gas most of which is obtained from third parties under longterm contracts energy represented 18 percent  of our copper mine site operating costs in 2017  

carbonbased energy is a significant input in our operations although the use of diesel in our haul trucks coal for power generation and availability of renewable energy for purchased power varies significantly depending on site production and countryspecific circumstances the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would vary by operation based on particular geographic circumstances as a result of the paris agreement reached during the 21 st  conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change in 2015 a number of governments have pledged “nationally determined contributions” to control and reduce greenhouse gas emissions although epa finalized regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions from new modified and existing power plants known as the clean power plan implementation of these rules has been delayed with the goal of revising the clean power plan increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may increase our costs 

other risks 

our holding company structure may impact our ability to service debt and our stockholders ’  ability to receive dividends  

we are a holding company with no material assets other than the capital stock and intercompany receivables of our subsidiaries as a result our ability to repay our indebtedness and pay dividends is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend loan debt repayment or otherwise our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to make funds available to us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends dividends from subsidiaries that are not wholly owned are shared with other equity owners cash at our international operations is also typically subject to foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation into the us 

in addition our subsidiaries may not be able to or be permitted to make distributions to us or repay loans to us to enable us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal restrictions as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries certain of our subsidiaries are parties to credit agreements that restrict their ability to make distributions or loan repayments to us if such subsidiary is in default under such agreements or to transfer substantially all of the assets of such subsidiary without the consent of the lenders 

our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries’ assets upon their liquidation reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries’ creditors including any trade creditors 

 51 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult these provisions 

 

 

 

 

these provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by the board 

in addition because we are incorporated in delaware we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with or acquisition of us 

these provisions may deter an acquisition of us that might otherwise be attractive to stockholders 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

not applicable 







 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in numerous legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business or are associated with environmental issues arising from legacy operations conducted over the years by freeport minerals corporation fmc and its affiliates we are also involved periodically in reviews inquiries investigations and other proceedings initiated by or involving government agencies some of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief management does not believe based on currently available information that the outcome of any legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition although individual outcomes could be material to our operating results for a particular period depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period below is a discussion of our material water rights legal proceedings refer to note 12  for discussion of our other material legal proceedings 

water rights legal proceedings 

our operations in the western united states us require significant secure quantities of water for mining ore processing and related support facilities continuous operation of our mines is dependent on among other things our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies in the arid western us where certain of our mines are located water rights are often contested and disputes over water rights are generally timeconsuming expensive and not necessarily dispositive unless they resolve both actual and potential claims the loss of a water right or a currently available water supply could force us to curtail operations or force premature closures thereby increasing andor accelerating costs or foregoing profitable operations 

at our north america operations certain of our water supplies are supported by surface water rights which give us the right to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location in arizona where our

operations use both surface and groundwater we are a participant in an active general stream adjudication in which the arizona courts have been attempting for over 40 years to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for the gila river one of the state’s largest river systems which primarily affect our morenci safford and sierrita mines the adjudication is addressing the state law claims of thousands of competing users including us as well as significant federal water claims that are potentially adverse to the state law claims of both surface water and groundwater users groundwater is treated differently from surface water under arizona law which historically allowed land owners to pump unlimited quantities of subsurface water subject only to the requirement of putting it to “reasonable use” however court decisions in the adjudication have concluded that certain underground water constitutes “subflow” that is to be treated legally as surface water and is therefore subject to the arizona doctrine of prior appropriation this category of underground water is subject to the adjudication and potentially unavailable to groundwater pumpers in the absence of valid surface water claims which historic groundwater pumpers typically do not have any recharacterization of groundwater as surface water could affect the ability of consumers farmers ranchers municipalities and industrial users like us to continue to access water supplies that have been relied on for decades because we are a user of both groundwater and surface water in arizona we are an active participant in the adjudication proceeding 

in re the general adjudication of all rights to use water in the gila river system and sources  maricopa county superior court cause nos w1 salt w2 verde w3 upper gila and w4 san pedro this case was originally initiated in 1974 with the filing of a petition with the arizona state land department and was consolidated and transferred to the maricopa county superior court in 1981 the principal parties in addition to us include the state of arizona the gila valley irrigation district the franklin irrigation district the san carlos irrigation and drainage district the salt river project the san carlos apache tribe the gila river indian community gric and the us on behalf of those tribes on its own behalf and on behalf of the white mountain apache tribe the fort mcdowell mohaveapache indian community the salt river pimamaricopa indian community and the payson community of yavapai apache indians 

prior to january 1 1983 various indian tribes filed suits in the us district court in arizona claiming superior rights to water being used by many other water users including us and claiming damages for prior use in derogation of their allegedly superior rights these federal proceedings have either been stayed pending the arizona superior court adjudications or have been settled 

the maricopa county superior court issued a decision in 2005 in the gila river adjudication that directed the arizona department of water resources adwr to prepare detailed recommendations regarding the delineation of the “subflow” zone of the san pedro river a tributary of the gila river according to the court the subflow zone is the subsurface area adjacent to the river consisting of the floodplain holocene alluvium underground water within the subflow zone is presumed to constitute appropriable subflow rather than groundwater although we have minimal interests in the san pedro river basin a decision that recharacterizes groundwater in that basin as appropriable surface water may set a precedent for other river systems in arizona that could have material implications for many commercial industrial municipal and agricultural users of groundwater including our arizona operations 

in june 2009 adwr produced its recommended subflow zone delineation which was objected to by numerous parties following a series of hearings and court rulings adwr submitted a revised subflow zone delineation report in 2014 the court held hearings in 2015 to address the parties’ comments and objections in 2017 the court approved adwr’s revised delineation and no party has appealed that decision 

also in 2014 adwr submitted a proposal for the next projects that it believes should be undertaken in the case including the development of procedures for “cone of depression” analyses to determine whether a well located outside of the subflow zone creates a cone of depression that intersects the subflow zone and causes a 01 foot drawdown based on the cone of depression analyses wells outside of the subflow zone could be subject to the jurisdiction of the adjudication court in the absence of a valid surface water claim to support the pumping owners of wells deemed to be depleting the subflow zone through their cones of depression may be required to refrain from pumping or pay damages 

on january 27 2017 adwr issued a report containing its recommended cone of depression test and on january 31 2017 the special master issued an order initiating proceedings on the cone of depression test methodology developed by adwr parties filed preliminary objections to the proposed methodology contained in adwr’s report on march 6 2017 on march 15 2017 the special master held a status conference to determine the timing and scope of proceedings necessary to resolve the objections including the submission of supplemental objections and 

 53 

expert reports following the status conference the special master established a discovery schedule leading up to a trial in march 2018 concerning adwr’s recommended cone of depression test during the course of these proceedings it has been established that adwr’s current recommended cone of depression test is for the purpose of establishing which wells are subject to the jurisdiction of the adjudication court this phase of current cone of depression testing will not satisfy the burden of proving that a well is pumping subflow nor will it establish how much of a well’s production is subflow versus groundwater these matters will be determined by a subsequent “subflow depletion test” which has not yet been formulated the special master has ordered adwr to produce an initial report on the subflow depletion test by november 16 2018 the parties’ comments to adwr’s initial report are due on january 18 2019 

  

as part of the gila river adjudication the us has asserted numerous claims for express and implied “reserved” surface water and groundwater rights on indian and nonindian federal lands throughout arizona these claims are related to reservations of federal land for specific purposes  eg  indian reservations national parks military bases and wilderness areas unlike state lawbased water rights federal reserved water rights are given priority in the prior appropriation system based on the date the land was reserved not the date that water was first used on the land in addition federal reserved water rights if recognized by the court may enjoy greater protection from groundwater pumping than is accorded to state lawbased water rights 

because federal reserved water rights have not yet been quantified the task of determining how much water each federal reservation may use has been left to the gila river adjudication court several “contested cases” to quantify reserved water rights for particular federal reservations in arizona are currently pending in the adjudication for instance in re aravaipa canyon wilderness area  is a contested case to resolve the us’s claims to water for the aravaipa canyon wilderness area these claims went to trial in 2015 and the parties are awaiting a decision in re fort huachuca  concerns the us’s claims to water for an army base trial concluded in february 2017 and the parties are awaiting a decision   in re redfield canyon wilderness area  is a contested case concerning us claims for another wilderness area trial occurred in may 2017 and the matter will be taken under advisement following the completion of posttrial briefings in re san pedro riparian national conservation area  involves us claims for a national conservation area and the case is scheduled for trial in april and may 2018 

in multiple instances the us asserts a right to all water in a particular watershed that was not effectively appropriated under state law prior to the establishment of the federal reservation this creates risks for both surface water users and groundwater users because such expansive claims may severely impede current and future uses of water within the same watershed federal reserved rights present additional risks to water users aside from the significant quantities of water claimed by the us of particular significance federal reserved rights enjoy greater protection from groundwater pumping than is accorded to state lawbased water rights 

because there are numerous federal reservations in watersheds across arizona the reserved water right claims of the us pose a significant risk to multiple operations including morenci and safford in the upper gila river watershed and sierrita in the santa cruz watershed because federal reserved water rights may adversely affect water uses at each of these operations we have been actively involved in litigation over these claims 

given the legal and technical complexity of these adjudications their long history and their longterm legal economic and political implications it is difficult to predict the timing or the outcome of these proceedings if we are unable to satisfactorily resolve the issues being addressed in the adjudications our ability to pump groundwater could be diminished or curtailed and our operations at morenci safford and sierrita mines could be adversely affected unless we are able to acquire alternative resources

copper gold and molybdenum 

following provides a brief discussion of our primary natural resources – copper gold and molybdenum for further discussion of historical and current market prices of these commodities refer to mda and item 1a risk factors 

copper 

copper is an internationally traded commodity and its prices are determined by the major metals exchanges – the london metal exchange lme new york mercantile exchange nymex and shanghai futures exchange prices on these exchanges generally reflect the worldwide balance of copper supply and demand and can be volatile and cyclical during 2016  the lme spot copper price averaged 221  per pound ranging from a low of 196  per pound to a high of 269  per pound and was 250  per pound at december 31 2016  

in general demand for copper reflects the rate of underlying world economic growth particularly in industrial production and construction according to wood mackenzie a widely followed independent metals market consultant copper’s enduse markets and their estimated shares of total consumption are construction 31 percent consumer products 24 percent electrical applications 24 percent transportation 11 percent and industrial machinery 10 percent 

gold 

gold is used for jewelry coinage and bullion as well as various industrial and electronic applications gold can be readily sold on numerous markets throughout the world benchmark prices are generally based on london bullion market association london pm quotations during 2016  the london pm gold price averaged 1250  per ounce ranging from a low of 1077  per ounce to a high of 1366  per ounce and was 1159  per ounce at december 31 2016  

molybdenum 

molybdenum is a key alloying element in steel and the raw material for several chemicalgrade products used in catalysts lubrication smoke suppression corrosion inhibition and pigmentation molybdenum as a highpurity metal is also used in electronics such as flatpanel displays and in super alloys used in aerospace reference prices for molybdenum are available in several publications including metals week cru report and  metal bulletin  during 2016  the weekly average price of molybdenum quoted by metals week  averaged 647  per pound ranging from a low of 515  per pound to a high of 847  per pound and was 674  per pound at december 31 2016  

products and sales 

fcx’s consolidated revenues for 2016  primarily included sales of copper  70 percent  gold  10 percent  oil  9 percent  and molybdenum  4 percent  oil and gas sales to phillips 66 company represented 12 percent  of our consolidated revenues in 2014  no other customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated revenues in any of the past three years refer to note 16  for a summary of our consolidated revenues and operating income loss by business segment and geographic area 

copper products 

we are one of the world’s leading producers of copper concentrate cathode and continuous cast copper rod during 2016  58 percent  of our mined copper was sold in concentrate 21 percent  as cathode and 21 percent  as rod from north america operations 

the copper ore from our mines is generally processed either by smelting and refining or by solution extraction and electrowinning sxew before being subject to the smelting and refining process ore is crushed and treated to produce a copper concentrate with copper content of approximately 20 to 30 percent copper concentrate is then smelted  ie  subjected to extreme heat to produce copper anode which weighs between 800 and 900 pounds and has an average copper content of 995 percent the anode is further treated by electrolytic refining to produce copper cathode which weighs between 100 and 350 pounds and has an average copper content of 9999 percent for ore subject to the sxew process copper is extracted from the ore by dissolving it with a weak sulphuric acid solution the copper content of the solution is increased in two additional solutionextraction stages and then the copperbearing solution undergoes an electrowinning process to produce cathode that is on average 9999 percent copper our copper cathode is used as the raw material input for copper rod brass mill products and for other uses 

 4 

copper concentrate  we produce copper concentrate at six of our mines in north america copper concentrate is produced at the morenci bagdad sierrita and chino mines and a significant portion is shipped to our miami smelter in arizona copper concentrate is also produced at the cerro verde mine in peru and the grasberg minerals district in indonesia 

copper cathode  we produce copper cathode at our electrolytic refinery located in el paso texas and at nine of our mines sxew cathode is produced from the morenci bagdad safford sierrita miami chino and tyrone mines in north america and from the cerro verde and el abra mines in south america   copper cathode is also produced at atlantic copper our wholly owned copper smelting and refining unit in spain and pt smelting ptfis 25percentowned copper smelter and refinery in indonesia refer to mining operations  smelting facilities and other mining properties for further discussion of atlantic copper and pt smelting 

continuous cast copper rod  we manufacture continuous cast copper rod at our facilities in el paso texas norwich connecticut and miami arizona primarily using copper cathode produced at our north america copper mines 

copper sales 

north america  the majority of the copper produced at our north america copper mines and refined in our el paso texas refinery is consumed at our rod plants the remainder of our north america copper production is sold in the form of copper cathode or copper concentrate under us dollardenominated annual contracts cathode and rod contract prices are generally based on the prevailing commodity exchange inc comex  a division of nymex monthly average spot price for the month of shipment and include a premium generally copper rod is sold to wire and cable manufacturers while cathode is sold to rod brass or tube fabricators during 2016  12 percent of our north america mines copper concentrate sales volumes were shipped to atlantic copper 

south america    production from our south america mines is sold as copper concentrate or copper cathode under us dollardenominated annual and multiyear contracts during 2016  our south america mines sold approximately 75 percent of their copper production in concentrate and 25 percent as cathode during 2016 four percent of our south america mines copper concentrate sales volumes were shipped to atlantic copper 

substantially all of south america’s copper concentrate and cathode sales contracts provide final copper pricing in a specified future month generally one to four months from the shipment date primarily based on quoted lme monthly average spot copper prices revenues from south america’s concentrate sales are recorded net of royalties and treatment charges  ie  fees paid to smelters that are generally negotiated annually in addition because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrate is unrecoverable from the smelting process revenues from south america’s concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances for unrecoverable metals which are a negotiated term of the contracts and vary by customer 

indonesia    ptfi sells its production in the form of copper concentrate which contains significant quantities of gold and silver under us dollardenominated longterm contracts ptfi also sells a small amount of copper concentrate in the spot market following is a summary of ptfi’s aggregate percentage concentrate sales to third parties pt smelting and atlantic copper for the years ended december 31 



substantially all of ptfi’s concentrate sales contracts provide final copper pricing in a specified future month generally one to four months from the shipment date primarily based on quoted lme monthly average spot copper prices revenues from ptfi’s concentrate sales are recorded net of royalties export duties treatment charges and allowances for unrecoverable metals 

gold products and sales 

we produce gold mostly from the grasberg minerals district gold is primarily sold as a component of our copper concentrate or in slimes which are a product of the smelting and refining process at atlantic copper gold generally is priced at the average london price for a specified month near the month of shipment revenues from gold sold 

 5 

as a component of our copper concentrate are recorded net of treatment and refining charges revenues from gold sold in slimes are recorded net of refining charges 

molybdenum products and sales 

we are the world’s largest producer of molybdenum and molybdenumbased chemicals in addition to production from the henderson and climax molybdenum mines we produce molybdenum concentrate at certain of the north america copper mines and the cerro verde copper mine in peru the majority of our molybdenum concentrate is processed in our own conversion facilities during 2016  our molybdenum sales were generally priced based on the average published metals week price for the month prior to the month of shipment we have incorporated changes in the commercial pricing structure for our molybdenumbased chemical products to enable continuation of chemicalgrade production 

labor matters 

at december 31 2016  we employed approximately 30000 people 12200 in indonesia 11000 in north america 5400 in south america and 1400 in europe and other locations we also had contractors that employ personnel at many of our operations including approximately 21300 at the grasberg   minerals district in indonesia 3700 at our south america mining operations 3700 in north america and 400 in europe and other locations employees represented by unions at december 31 2016  are listed below with the number of employees represented and the expiration date of the applicable union agreements 



 

refer to item 1a risk factors for further information on labor matters 

environmental and reclamation matters 

the cost of complying with environmental laws is fundamental to and a substantial cost of our business for information about environmental regulation litigation and related costs refer to item 1a “risk factors” and notes 1  and 12  

competition 

the top 10 producers of copper comprise approximately half of total worldwide mined copper production we currently rank second among those producers with approximately nine percent of estimated total worldwide mined copper production our competitive position is based on the size quality and grade of our ore bodies and our ability to manage costs compared with other producers we have a diverse portfolio of mining operations with varying ore grades and cost structures our costs are driven by the location grade and nature of our ore bodies and the level of input costs including energy labor and equipment the metals markets are cyclical and our ability to maintain our competitive position over the long term is based on our ability to acquire and develop quality deposits hire and retain a skilled workforce and to manage our costs

mining operations 

following are maps and descriptions of our mining operations in north america including both copper and molybdenum operations south america and indonesia 

north america 

in the us most of the land occupied by our copper and molybdenum mines concentrators sxew facilities smelter refinery rod mills molybdenum roasters and processing facilities is generally owned by us or is located on unpatented mining claims owned by us certain portions of our bagdad sierrita miami chino tyrone henderson and climax operations are located on governmentowned land and are operated under a mine plan of operations or other use permit various federal and state permits or leases on government land are held for purposes incidental to mine operations 

in response to market conditions beginning in the second half of 2015 we revised operating plans for our north america copper mines to reduce operating and capital costs and adjust production to reflect market conditions in addition we operated the henderson molybdenum mine at reduced rates resulting in an approximate 65 percent reduction in its annual production volumes these operating plans will continue to be reviewed and additional adjustments may be made as market conditions warrant 

  

morenci 

  

we own a 72 percent undivided interest in morenci with the remaining 28 percent owned by sumitomo metal mining arizona inc 15 percent and smm morenci inc 13 percent each partner takes in kind its share of morenci’s production 

morenci is an openpit copper mining complex that has been in continuous operation since 1939 and previously was mined through underground workings morenci is located in greenlee county arizona approximately 50 miles northeast of safford on us highway 191 the site is accessible by a paved highway and a railway spur 

the morenci mine is a porphyry copper deposit that has oxide secondary sulfide and primary sulfide mineralization the predominant oxide copper mineral is chrysocolla chalcocite is the most important secondary copper sulfide mineral with chalcopyrite as the dominant primary copper sulfide 

the morenci operation consists of two concentrators capable of milling 115000 metric tons of ore per day which produce copper and molybdenum concentrate a 68000 metric tonperday crushedore leach pad and stacking system a lowgrade runofmine rom leaching system four sx plants and three ew tank houses that produce copper cathode total ew tank house capacity is approximately 900 million pounds of copper per year during secondquarter 2015 morenci’s concentrate leach directelectrowinning facility which was placed on careandmaintenance status in early 2009 resumed operation morencis available mining fleet consists of one hundred and eleven 236metric ton haul trucks loaded by 12 shovels with bucket sizes ranging from 47 to 57 cubic meters which are capable of moving an average of 815000 metric tons of material per day 

the morenci mill expansion project which achieved full rates in secondquarter 2015 expanded mill capacity from 50000 metric tons of ore per day to approximately 115000 metric tons of ore per day which results in incremental annual production of approximately 225 million pounds of copper and an improvement in morencis cost structure 

 7

indonesia 

ownership  ptfi is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the republic of indonesia we directly own 8128 percent of the outstanding common stock of ptfi and indirectly own 936 percent through our wholly owned subsidiary pt indocopper investama the indonesian government owns the remaining 936 percent 

ptfi has an unincorporated joint venture with rio tinto under which rio tinto has a 40 percent interest in certain assets and future production exceeding specified annual amounts of copper gold and silver through 2022 in block a of ptfis contract of work cow and after 2022 a 40 percent interest in all production from block a the block a area is where all of ptfis proven and probable mineral reserves and all of its current mining operations are located refer to note 3  for further discussion of the joint venture agreement 

 16 

contract of work  ptfi conducts its current exploration and mining operations in indonesia through a cow with the indonesian government the cow governs our rights and obligations relating to taxes exchange controls royalties repatriation and other matters and was concluded pursuant to the 1967 foreign capital investment law which expresses indonesia’s foreign investment policy and provides basic guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization a framework for economic incentives and basic rules regarding other rights and obligations of foreign investors specifically the cow provides that the indonesian government will not nationalize or expropriate ptfi’s mining operations any disputes regarding the provisions of the cow are subject to international arbitration 

ptfi’s original cow was entered into in 1967 and was replaced by the current cow in 1991 the initial term of the current cow expires in 2021 but the cow explicitly provides that it can be extended for two 10year periods subject to indonesian government approval which pursuant to the cow cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably the cow allows us to conduct exploration mining and production activities in the 24700acre block a area under the cow ptfi also conducts exploration activities in the block b area currently covering 502000 acres 

under the cow ptfi pays royalties on copper gold and silver in the concentrate it sells refer to note 13  for further discussion of the royalty rates a large part of the mineral royalties under indonesian government regulations is designated to the provinces from which the minerals are extracted in connection with its fourth concentrator mill expansion completed in 1998 ptfi agreed to pay the indonesian government additional royalties which were not required by the cow to provide further support to the local governments and to the people of the indonesian province of papua ptfi’s royalties totaled 131 million  in 2016  114 million  in 2015  and 115 million  in 2014  

regulatory matters  ptfi continues to seek approval from indonesian authorities for the export of its copper concentrate consistent with its rights under the cow 

in january 2014 the indonesian government published regulations that among other things imposed a progressive export duty on copper concentrate and restricts concentrate exports after january 12 2017 despite ptfi’s rights under its cow to export concentrate without the payment of duties ptfi was unable to obtain administrative approval for exports and operated at approximately half of its capacity from midjanuary 2014 through july 2014 

in july 2014 ptfi and the indonesian government entered into a memorandum of understanding mou in which subject to concluding an agreement to extend ptfis operations beyond 2021 on acceptable terms ptfi agreed to construct new smelter capacity in indonesia and to divest an additional 2064 percent interest in ptfi at fair market value under the mou ptfi provided a 115 million assurance bond to support its commitment for smelter development agreed to increase royalty rates and agreed to pay export duties until certain smelter development milestones were met the mou also anticipated an amendment of the cow within six months to address other matters however no terms of the cow other than those relating to the smelter bond increased royalties and export duties were changed in january 2015 the mou was extended to july 25 2015 and it expired on that date the indonesian government has continued to impose the increased royalty rates export duties and smelter assurance bond ptfi paid export duties totaling 95 million  in 2016  109 million  in 2015  and  77 million  in 2014  

in october 2015 the indonesian government provided a letter of assurance to ptfi indicating that it would revise regulations allowing it to approve the extension of ptfis operations beyond 2021 and provide the same rights and the same level of legal and fiscal certainty provided under the current cow 

in january and february 2017 the indonesian government issued new regulations to address exports of unrefined metals including copper concentrate and anode slimes and other matters related to the mining sector the new regulations permit the continuation of copper concentrate exports for a fiveyear period through january 2022 subject to various conditions including conversion from a contract of work to a special operating license known as an iupk which provides virtually none of the protections of a contract of work commitment to completion of smelter construction in five years and payment of export duties to be determined by the ministry of finance in addition the new regulations enable application for extension of operating rights five years before expiration of the iupk and require foreign iupk holders to divest 51 percent to indonesian interests no later than the tenth year of production export licenses would be valid for oneyear periods subject to review every six months depending on smelter construction progress 

 17 

the january 2017 regulations permit the export of anode slimes which is necessary for pt smelting ptfi’s 25percentowned copper smelter and refinery located in gresik indonesia to continue operating pt smelting is seeking to renew its anode slimes export license however we cannot predict when pt smelting’s anode slimes export license may be renewed in addition a labor strike at pt smelting has resulted in a shutdown of its operations since january 19 2017 although ptfi is taking nearterm actions to reduce production to match available processing capacity at pt smelting or approximately 40 percent of ptfis concentrate production capacity on february 10 2017 ptfi was forced to suspend production as a result of limited storage capacity at ptfi and pt smelting pt smelting has indicated that it expects to resume operations in march 2017 delays in pt smelting obtaining its anode slimes export license or restarting operations could further impact ptfis operations 

following the issuance of the january and february 2017 regulations and discussions with the government ptfi advised the indonesian government that it was prepared to convert its cow to an iupk subject to obtaining an investment stability agreement providing equivalent rights with the same level of legal and fiscal certainty enumerated under its cow and provided that the cow would remain in effect until it is replaced by a mutually satisfactory alternative ptfi also committed to commence construction of a new smelter during a fiveyear timeframe after approval of the extension of its longterm operating rights 

under its cow ptfi has specified rights to export copper concentrate without restriction or payment of export duties ptfi has requested that concentrate exports be permitted without the imposition of export duties while the new license and stability agreement are negotiated the indonesia government has indicated that in order to export its concentrate production ptfi would be required to immediately convert to an iupk forgo its current rights to fiscal and legal certainty and commit to a new smelter prior to completing a longterm investment stability agreement ptfi has advised the indonesian government that attempts to enforce the new regulations on ptfi violates its cow and that it is unwilling to terminate its cow unless replaced by a mutually acceptable form of agreement providing fiscal and legal assurances to support its longterm investment plans in papua indonesia 

as of february 24 2017  ptfi has not obtained approval to export concentrate and production remains suspended ptfi is taking nearterm actions to reduce production to match available processing capacity at pt smelting or approximately 40 percent of ptfis concentrate production capacity assuming that pt smeltings export license is approved and its operations are resumed in march 2017 ptfi has begun to significantly adjust its cost structure reduce its workforce and spending with local suppliers and suspend investments in its underground development projects and new smelter 

on february 17 2017 pursuant to the cow’s dispute resolution provisions ptfi provided formal notice to the indonesian government of an impending dispute listing the government’s breaches and violations of the cow which are described in item 1a risk factors 

we cannot predict whether or when ptfi will be able to resume exporting copper concentrate for each month of delay in obtaining approval to export ptfi’s share of production is projected to be reduced by approximately 70 million pounds of copper and 70 thousand ounces of gold the inability of either ptfi to export copper concentrate or pt smelting to export anode slimes or restart operations for any extended period of time would lead to the continued suspension of production in indonesia we also cannot predict whether ptfi will be successful in reaching a satisfactory agreement on the terms of ptfis longterm mining rights if ptfi is unable to reach agreement with the indonesian government on its longterm mining rights we may be required to reduce or defer investments in underground development projects 

refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion of risks associated with operations in indonesia 

grasberg minerals district  ptfi operates in the remote highlands of the sudirman mountain range in the province of papua indonesia which is on the western half of the island of new guinea we and our predecessors have been the only operator of exploration and mining activities in block a since 1967 

the grasberg minerals district has three operating mines the grasberg open pit the deep ore zone doz underground mine and the big gossan underground mine where operations restarted in fourthquarter 2016 in addition in september 2015 ptfi initiated precommercial production at the deep mill level zone dmlz underground mine ptfi also has several projects in progress in the grasberg minerals district related to the development of the largescale longlived highgrade underground ore bodies located beneath and nearby the grasberg open pit including the grasberg block cave underground mine refer to mda for further discussion in aggregate these underground ore bodies are expected to produce largescale quantities of copper and gold 

 18 

following the transition from the grasberg open pit our current plans and mineral reserves at ptfi assume that the cow will be extended beyond 2021 refer to regulatory matters above for discussion of matters that could impact ptfis development plans 

ptfi’s production including our joint venture partner’s share totaled 11 billion  pounds of copper and 11 million  ounces of gold in 2016  752 million  pounds of copper and 12 million  ounces of gold in 2015  and 651 million  pounds of copper and 11 million  ounces of gold in 2014  

our principal source of power for all our indonesian operations is a coalfired power plant that we built in 1998 diesel generators supply peaking and backup electrical power generating capacity a combination of naturally occurring mountain streams and water derived from our underground operations provides water for our operations our indonesian operations are in an active seismic zone and experience average annual rainfall of approximately 200 inches 

grasberg open pit 

ptfi began openpit mining of the grasberg ore body in 1990 and is currently mining the final phase of the grasberg open pit which contains high copper and gold ore grades ptfi expects to mine highgrade ore over the next several quarters prior to transitioning to the grasberg block cave underground mine during 2018 additionally production from the ore stockpiles which are located outside of the pit limits is expected to continue until early 2019 production in the open pit is currently at the 3310 to 3520meter elevation level and totaled 44 million metric tons of ore in 2016  which provided 72 percent of ptfis 2016  mill feed 

the current openpit equipment fleet consists of over 500 units the larger mining equipment directly associated with production includes an available fleet of 132 haul trucks with payloads ranging from 218 to 276 metric tons and 16 shovels with bucket sizes ranging from 17 to 42 cubic meters which mined an average of 180500 metric tons of material per day in 2016  250400 metric tons per day in 2015  and 298400 metric tons per day in 2014  

crushing and conveying systems are integral to the grasberg mine and provide the capacity to transport more than 250000 metric tons of ore per day during 2016  grasbergs crushing and conveying systems delivered an average of 121000 metric tons of ore per day to the mill from january 2016 to may 2016 the grasberg overburden handling system delivered 19 million metric tons of overburden to the overburden stockpiles the remaining overburden moved by haul trucks averaged 16100 metric tons per day during 2016 ore milled from the grasberg open pit averaged 119700  metric tons per day in 2016  115900  metric tons per day in 2015  and 69100  metric tons per day in 2014  

doz underground mine 

the doz ore body lies vertically below the now depleted intermediate ore zone ptfi began production from the doz ore body in 1989 using openstope mining methods but suspended production in 1991 in favor of production from the grasberg open pit production resumed in september 2000 using the blockcave method and is at the 3110meter elevation level 

the doz is a mature blockcave mine that previously operated at 80000 metric tons of ore per day current operating rates from the doz underground mine are driven by the value of the incremental doz ore grade compared to the ore from the grasberg open pit and ore grade material from the development of the dmlz and grasberg block cave underground mines ore milled from the doz underground mine averaged 38000  metric tons of ore per day in 2016 43700 metric tons of ore per day in 2015 and 50500 metric tons of ore per day in 2014 production at the doz underground mine is expected to continue through 2021 and to ramp up to 60000 metric tons of ore per day in 2017 

the doz mine fleet consists of over 180 pieces of mobile equipment the primary mining equipment directly associated with production and development includes an available fleet of 46 lhd units and 22 haul trucks each production lhd unit typically carries approximately 11 metric tons of ore using ore passes and chutes the lhd units transfer ore into 55metric ton capacity haul trucks the trucks dump into two gyratory crushers and the ore is then conveyed to the surface stockpiles for processing 

the success of the development of the doz mine one of the world’s largest underground mines provides confidence in the future development of ptfi’s largescale underground ore bodies

dmlz underground mine 

the dmlz ore body lies below the doz underground mine at the 2590meter elevation and represents the downward continuation of mineralization in the ertsberg east skarn system and neighboring ertsberg porphyry in september 2015 ptfi initiated precommercial production at the dmlz underground mine which represents ore extracted during the development phase for the purpose of obtaining access to the ore body ore milled from the dmlz underground mine averaged 4400  metric tons of ore per day in 2016  and 2900 metric tons per day in 2015 targeted production rates once the dmlz underground mine reaches full capacity are expected to approximate 80000 metric tons of ore per day in 2022 production at the dmlz underground mine is expected to continue through 2041 

the dmlz mine fleet consists of over 210 pieces of mobile equipment which includes 24 lhd units and 16 haul trucks used in production and development activities 

big gossan underground mine 

production from the big gossan ore body which restarted in fourthquarter 2016 is expected to ramp up to 7000 metric tons of ore per day in 2022 the big gossan mine lies underground and adjacent to the current mill site it is a tabular near vertical ore body with approximate dimensions of 1200 meters along strike and 800 meters down dip with varying thicknesses from 20 meters to 120 meters the mine utilizes a blasthole stoping method with delayed paste backfill stopes of varying sizes are mined and the ore dropped down passes to a truck haulage level trucks are chute loaded and transport the ore to a jaw crusher the crushed ore is then hoisted vertically via a twoskip production shaft to a level where it is loaded onto a conveyor belt the belt carries the ore to one of the main underground conveyors where the ore is transferred and conveyed to the surface stockpiles for processing 

the big gossan mine fleet consists of over 71 pieces of mobile equipment which includes 8 lhd units and 9 haul trucks used in development and production activities 

description of ore bodies   our indonesia ore bodies are located within and around two main igneous intrusions the grasberg monzodiorite and the ertsberg diorite the host rocks of these ore bodies include both carbonate and clastic rocks that form the ridge crests and upper flanks of the sudirman range and the igneous rocks of monzonitic to dioritic composition that intrude them the igneoushosted ore bodies the grasberg open pit and block cave and portions of the doz block cave occur as vein stockworks and disseminations of copper sulfides dominated by chalcopyrite and to a lesser extent bornite the sedimentaryrock hosted ore bodies portions of the doz and all of the big gossan occur as “magnetiterich calciummagnesian skarn” replacements whose location and orientation are strongly influenced by major faults and by the chemistry of the carbonate rocks along the margins of the intrusions 

the copper mineralization in these skarn deposits is dominated by chalcopyrite but higher bornite concentrations are common moreover gold occurs in significant concentrations in all of the district’s ore bodies though rarely visible to the naked eye these gold concentrations usually occur as inclusions within the copper sulfide minerals though in some deposits these concentrations can also be strongly associated with pyrite

the following diagram indicates the relative elevations in meters of our reported indonesia ore bodies the following map which encompasses an area of approximately 42 square kilometers approximately 16 square miles indicates the relative positions and sizes of our reported indonesia ore bodies and their locations 

smelting facilities and other mining properties 

atlantic copper  our wholly owned atlantic copper smelter and refinery is located on land concessions from the huelva spain port authorities which are scheduled to expire in 2027 

the design capacity of the smelter is approximately 295000 metric tons of copper per year and the refinery has a capacity of 285000 metric tons of copper per year atlantic copper produced 296900 metric tons of copper anode 

 21 

from its smelter and 285800 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2016  293100 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 284800 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2015 and 294100 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 283800 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2014 

following is a summary of atlantic coppers concentrate purchases from third parties and our copper mining operations for the years ended december 31 



 

atlantic coppers major maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately every eight years with shorterterm maintenance turnarounds in the interim atlantic copper completed a 68day major maintenance turnaround in 2013 and a 13day shorterterm maintenance in 2015 the next 21day maintenance turnaround is scheduled for secondquarter 2017 

pt smelting  ptfi’s cow required us to construct or cause to be constructed a smelter in indonesia if we and the indonesian government determined that such a project would be economically viable in 1995 following the completion of a feasibility study we entered into agreements relating to the formation of pt smelting an indonesian company and the construction of the copper smelter and refinery in gresik indonesia pt smelting owns and operates the smelter and refinery ptfi owns 25 percent of pt smelting with the remainder owned by mitsubishi materials corporation 605 percent mitsubishi corporation unimetals ltd 95 percent and jx nippon mining  metals corporation 5 percent 

ptfi’s contract with pt smelting requires ptfi to supply 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements at market rates subject to a minimum or maximum treatment charge rate necessary for pt smelting to produce 205000 metric tons of copper annually on a priority basis an extension of the minimum and maximum treatment charge rate which expires in april 2017 is currently being negotiated ptfi may also sell copper concentrate to pt smelting at market rates for quantities in excess of 205000 metric tons of copper annually ptfi supplied 88 percent  of pt smeltings concentrate requirements in 2016 and approximately 80 percent  in both 2015 and 2014 

pt smelting produced 255700 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 241700 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2016  199700 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 198400 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2015 and 236900 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 231800 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2014 following a temporary suspension in july 2015 pt smelting operated at approximately 80 percent capacity from september 2015 to november 2015 when required repairs of an acid plant cooling tower that was damaged during the suspension were completed 

pt smeltings maintenance turnarounds which range from two weeks to a month to complete typically are expected to occur approximately every two years with shortterm maintenance turnarounds in the interim pt smelting completed a 25day maintenance turnaround during 2016 and the next major maintenance turnaround is scheduled for 2018 

in january and february 2017 the indonesian government issued new regulations to address exports of unrefined metals including copper concentrate and anode slimes and other matters related to the mining sector these regulations permit the export of anode slimes which is necessary for pt smelting to continue operating pt smelting is seeking to renew its anode slimes export license however we cannot predict when pt smeltings anode slimes export license may be renewed in addition a labor strike at pt smelting has resulted in a shutdown of its operations since january 19 2017 pt smelting has indicated that it expects to resume operations in march 2017 refer to item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion of indonesia regulatory matters 

 22 

miami smelter  we own and operate a smelter at our miami mining operation in arizona the smelter has been operating for approximately 100 years and has been upgraded numerous times during that period to implement new technologies to improve production and to comply with air quality requirements the miami smelter is installing emission control equipment that will allow it to operate in compliance with adopted air quality standards refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion 

the miami smelter processes copper concentrate primarily from our north america copper mines concentrate processed through the smelter totaled 673300 metric tons in 2016  686700 metric tons in 2015 and 603700 metric tons in 2014 in addition because sulphuric acid is a byproduct of smelting concentrate the miami smelter is also the most significant source of sulphuric acid for our north america leaching operations refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion 

major maintenance turnarounds which take approximately three weeks to complete typically occur approximately every 14 months for the miami smelter with shortterm maintenance turnarounds in the interim the miami smelter completed a major maintenance turnaround in thirdquarter 2016 and the next major maintenance turnaround is scheduled for secondquarter 2017 

rod  refining operations  our rod  refining operations consist of conversion facilities located in north america including a refinery in el paso texas rod mills in el paso texas norwich connecticut and miami arizona and a specialty copper products facility in bayway new jersey we refine our copper anode production from our miami smelter at our el paso refinery the el paso refinery has the potential to operate at an annual production capacity of about 900 million pounds of copper cathode which is sufficient to refine all of the copper anode we produce at our miami smelter our el paso refinery also produces nickel carbonate copper telluride and autoclaved slimes material containing gold silver platinum and palladium 

molybdenum conversion facilities  we process molybdenum concentrate at our conversion plants in the us and europe into such products as technicalgrade molybdic oxide ferromolybdenum pure molybdic oxide ammonium molybdates and molybdenum disulfide we operate molybdenum roasters in sierrita arizona fort madison iowa and rotterdam the netherlands and we operate a molybdenum pressureleach plant in bagdad arizona we also produce ferromolybdenum for customers worldwide at our conversion plant located in stowmarket united kingdom 

freeport cobalt  in march 2013 we acquired a cobalt chemical refinery in kokkola finland and the related sales and marketing business which provided direct endmarket access for the cobalt hydroxide production at the tenke mine the joint venture operates under the name freeport cobalt and we are the operator with an effective 56 percent ownership interest the remaining effective ownership interest is held by lundin mining corporation 24 percent and la générale des carrières et des mines 20 percent the kokkola refinery has an annual refining capacity of approximately 15000 metric tons of cobalt 

as further discussed in note 2 we have agreed to negotiate exclusively with china molybdenum co ltd until february 28 2017 to enter into a definitive agreement to sell our interest in freeport cobalt for 100 million 

other north america copper mines  we also have five nonoperating copper mines in north america – ajo bisbee twin buttes and tohono in arizona and cobre in new mexico – that have been on careandmaintenance status for several years and would require new or updated environmental studies new permits and additional capital investment which could be significant to return them to operating status 

mining development projects and exploration 

capital expenditures for mining operations totaled 16 billion  including 12 billion for major projects in 2016  33 billion  including 24 billion  for major projects in 2015  and 40 billion  including 29 billion  for major projects in 2014  capital expenditures for major projects during the three years ended december 31 2016  were primarily associated with expansion projects at morenci and cerro verde and underground development activities at grasberg refer to mda for projected capital expenditures for the year 2017 ptfi has begun suspending investments in its underground development projects pending resolution of its longterm mining rights if ptfi is unable to reach agreement with the indonesian government on its longterm mining rights we may be required to further reduce or defer investments in underground development projects 

  

we have several projects and potential opportunities to expand production volumes extend mine lives and develop largescale underground ore bodies as further discussed in mda our nearterm major development projects primarily include the underground development activities in the grasberg minerals district considering the long 

 23 

term nature and large size of our development projects actual costs and timing could vary from estimates additionally in response to market conditions and indonesian regulatory uncertainty the timing of our expenditures will continue to be reviewed as further discussed in mining operations  indonesia ptfi also committed to commence construction of a new smelter during a five year timeframe after obtaining an investment stability agreement providing equivalent rights with the same level of legal and fiscal certainty enumerated under ptfis cow which has not been received as of february 24 2017  as a result ptfi has begun suspending investments in its underground development projects and new smelter refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion of indonesia regulatory matters we continue to review our mine development and processing plans to maximize the value of our mineral reserves 

we also have an additional longterm underground mine development project in the grasberg minerals district for the kucing liar ore body which lies on the southern flank of and underneath the southern portion of the grasberg open pit at the 2605meter elevation level we expect to mine the kucing liar ore body using the blockcave method aggregate capital cost estimates for development of the kucing liar ore body are projected to approximate 26 billion which are expected to be made between 2019 and 2031 additionally our current mine development plans include approximately 57 billion of capital expenditures at our processing facilities to optimize the handling of underground ore types once the grasberg openpit operations cease we expect substantially all of these expenditures to be made between 2019 and 2034 if ptfi is unable to reach agreement with the indonesian government on its longterm mining rights we may be required to reduce or defer investments in underground development projects 

our mining exploration activities are generally associated with our existing mines focusing on opportunities to expand reserves and resources to support development of additional future production capacity exploration results continue to indicate opportunities for significant future potential reserve additions in north and south america exploration spending associated with mining operations totaled 44 million  in 2016  96 million in 2015  and 182 million in 2014  exploration spending is expected to approximate 47 million  for the year 2017  

sources and availability of energy natural resources and raw materials 

our copper mining operations require significant energy principally diesel electricity coal and natural gas most of which is obtained from third parties under longterm contracts energy represented approximately 20 percent  of our copper mine site operating costs in 2016  and included purchases of approximately 214 million  gallons of diesel fuel 8400  gigawatt hours of electricity at our north and south america copper mining operations we generate all of our power at our indonesia mining operation 780 thousand  metric tons of coal for our coal power plant in indonesia and 1 million  mmbtu british thermal units of natural gas at certain of our north america mines based on current cost projections we estimate energy will approximate 20 percent  of our copper mine site operating costs in 2017  

our mining operations also require significant quantities of water for mining ore processing and related support facilities the loss of water rights for any of our mines in whole or in part or shortages of water to which we have rights could require us to curtail or shut down mining operations for a further discussion of risks and legal proceedings associated with the availability of water refer to item 1a “risk factors” and item 3 “legal proceedings” 

sulphuric acid is used in the sxew process and is produced as a byproduct of the smelting process at our smelters and from our sulfur burners at the safford mine sulphuric acid needs in excess of the sulphuric acid produced by our operations are purchased from third parties as further discussed in item 1a risk factors if production were to be curtailed at the miami smelter we would be required to export concentrate rather than process it ourselves and to purchase sulphuric acid from third parties thereby increasing our operating costs 

community and human rights 

we have adopted policies that govern our working relationships with the communities where we operate and are designed to guide our practices and programs in a manner that respects human rights and the culture of the local people impacted by our operations we continue to make significant expenditures on community development education training and cultural programs which include 



 24 

 

in december 2000 we endorsed the joint us state departmentbritish foreign office voluntary principles on human rights and security voluntary principles we participated in developing these voluntary principles with other major natural resource companies and international human rights organizations and they are incorporated into our human rights policy the voluntary principles provide guidelines for our security programs including interaction with hostgovernment security personnel private security contractors and our internal security employees 

we completed a corporate level human rights impact assessment in 2014 the results of which were used to evaluate our human rights program including a review of our human rights policy in february 2015 we updated our human rights policy to among other things reflect our commitment to integrating the united nations guiding principles on business and human rights into our human rights program we have embarked on a program to plan and conduct sitelevel human rights impact assessments at operations with higher potential risks we also participate in a multiindustry human rights working group to gain insight from peer companies and are integrating human rights due diligence into our business practices 

we believe that our social and economic development programs are responsive to the issues raised by the local communities near our areas of operation and help us maintain good relations with the surrounding communities and avoid disruptions of mining operations as part of our ongoing commitment to sustainable community development we make significant investments in social programs including inkind support and administration across our global operations over the last five years these investments have averaged 170 million per year nevertheless social and political instability in the areas of our operations may adversely impact our mining operations refer to item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

south america  cerro verde has provided a variety of community support projects over the years following engagements with regional and local governments civic leaders and development agencies in 2006 cerro verde committed to support the costs for a new potable water treatment plant to serve arequipa in addition an agreement was reached with the peruvian government for development of a water storage network that was financed by cerro verde and a distribution network that was financed by the cerro verde civil association the association the association manages contributions made by cerro verde for projects that focus on education training health cultural preservation and basic infrastructure 

cerro verde reached an agreement with the regional government of arequipa the national government sedapar and other local institutions to allow it to finance engineer and construct a wastewater treatment plant for the city of arequipa which was completed in 2015 the wastewater treatment plant supplements existing water supplies to support cerro verdes concentrator expansion and also improves the regional water quality enhances agriculture products grown in the area and reduces waterborne illnesses in addition to these projects cerro verde annually makes significant community development investments in the arequipa region 

security matters  consistent with our operating permits in peru and our commitment to protect our employees and property we have taken steps to provide a safe and secure working environment as part of its security program cerro verde maintains its own internal security department both employees and contractors perform functions such as protecting company facilities monitoring shipments of supplies and products assisting in traffic control and aiding in emergency response operations the security department receives human rights and voluntary principles training annually some contractors assigned to protection of expatriate personnel are armed these contractors receive training in motivation and defensive driving weekly human rights and voluntary principles monthly and firearms quarterly cerro verde’s costs for its internal civilian security department totaled 6 million in both 2016 and 2015 and 7 million in 2014 

cerro verde and all businesses and residents of peru rely on the peruvian government for the maintenance of public order upholding the rule of law and the protection of personnel and property the peruvian government is responsible for employing police and military personnel and directing their operations since 1997 the peruvian government has relied on cerro verde to provide logistical and infrastructure support and assistance for these necessary services because of the limited resources of the peruvian government cerro verde’s financial support for the peruvian government security institutions assigned to the operations area represents a prudent response to its requirements to protect its workforce and property better ensuring that personnel are properly fed and lodged 

 25 

and have the logistical resources to secure cerro verde’s operating area in addition providing such support reflects our philosophy of responsible corporate citizenship and is in keeping with our commitment to pursue practices that promote human rights 

cerro verde’s share of support costs for the governmentprovided security approximated 1 million in each of the years 2016 2015 and 2014 this supplemental support consists of various infrastructure and other costs such as food housing fuel travel vehicle repairs allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs and community assistance programs conducted by the military and police 

indonesia  in 1996 ptfi established the freeport partnership fund for community development the partnership fund through which ptfi has made available funding and technical assistance to support community development initiatives in the areas of health education and economic development of the area ptfi has committed through 2018 to provide one percent of its annual revenue for the development of the local people in its area of operations through the partnership fund ptfi recognized 33 million  in 2016  27 million  in 2015  and 31 million  in 2014  for this commitment 

the amungme and kamoro community development organization  lembaga pengembangan masyarakat amungme dan kamoro  or lpmak oversees disbursement of the program funds we contribute to the partnership fund lpmak is governed by a board of commissioners and a board of directors which are comprised of representatives from the local amungme and kamoro tribal communities government leaders church leaders and one representative of ptfi on each board the amungme and kamoro people are original inhabitants of the land in our area of operations in addition to the partnership fund ptfi annually makes significant investments in public health education community infrastructure and economic development 

security matters    consistent with our cow in indonesia and our commitment to protect our employees and property we have taken steps to provide a safe and secure working environment as part of its security program ptfi maintains its own internal security department both employees and contractors are unarmed and perform functions such as protecting company facilities monitoring shipments of supplies and products assisting in traffic control and aiding in emergency response operations the security department receives human rights training annually 

ptfi’s share of costs for its internal civilian security department totaled 58 million for both 2016  and 2015  and 57 million for 2014  

ptfi and all businesses and residents of indonesia rely on the indonesian government for the maintenance of public order upholding the rule of law and the protection of personnel and property the grasberg minerals district has been designated by the indonesian government as one of indonesia’s vital national assets this designation results in the police and to a lesser extent the military playing a significant role in protecting the area of our operations the indonesian government is responsible for employing police and military personnel and directing their operations 

from the outset of ptfi’s operations the indonesian government has looked to ptfi to provide logistical and infrastructure support and assistance for these necessary services because of the limited resources of the indonesian government and the remote location of and lack of development in papua ptfi’s financial support for the indonesian government security institutions assigned to the operations area represents a prudent response to its requirements to protect its workforce and property better ensuring that personnel are properly fed and lodged and have the logistical resources to patrol ptfi’s roads and secure its operating area in addition the provision of such support is consistent with ptfi’s obligations under the cow reflects our philosophy of responsible corporate citizenship and is in keeping with our commitment to pursue practices that will promote human rights 

ptfi’s share of support costs for the governmentprovided security was 20 million in 2016  21 million in 2015  and 27 million in 2014  this supplemental support consists of various infrastructure and other costs such as food housing fuel travel vehicle repairs allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs and community assistance programs conducted by the military and police

mineral reserves 

recoverable proven and probable reserves have been calculated in accordance with industry guide 7 as required by the securities exchange act of 1934 proven and probable reserves may not be comparable to similar information regarding mineral reserves disclosed in accordance with the guidance in other countries proven and probable reserves were determined by the use of mapping drilling sampling assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry as more fully discussed below the term “reserve” as used in the reserve data presented here means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination the term “proven reserves” means reserves for which i quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops trenches workings or drill holes ii grade andor quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and iii the sites for inspection sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established the term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced the degree of assurance although lower than that for proven reserves is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 

our mineral reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies we conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk we revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies 

estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves at december 31 2016  were determined using longterm average prices of 200  per pound for copper 1000  per ounce for gold and 10  per pound for molybdenum for the threeyear period ended december 31 2016  lme spot copper prices averaged 260  per pound london pm gold prices averaged 1226  per ounce and the weekly average price for molybdenum quoted by metals week  averaged 818  per pound 

the recoverable proven and probable reserves presented in the table below represent the estimated metal quantities from which we expect to be paid after application of estimated metallurgical recovery rates and smelter recovery rates where applicable recoverable reserves are that part of a mineral deposit that we estimate can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination

the reserve table above and the tables on the following pages utilize the abbreviations described below

 31 

in defining our openpit reserves we apply a “variable cutoff grade” strategy the objective of this strategy is to maximize the net present value of our operations we use a breakeven cutoff grade to define the insitu reserves for our underground ore bodies the breakeven cutoff grade is defined for a metric ton of ore as that equivalent copper grade once produced and sold that generates sufficient revenue to cover all operating and administrative costs associated with our production 

our copper mines may contain other commercially recoverable metals such as gold molybdenum and silver we value all commercially recoverable metals in terms of a copper equivalent percentage to determine a single cutoff grade copper equivalent percentage is used to express the relative value of multimetal ores in terms of one metal the calculation expresses the relative value of the ore using estimates of contained metal quantities metals prices as used for reserve determination recovery rates treatment charges and royalties our molybdenum properties use a molybdenum cutoff grade 

the table below shows the minimum cutoff grade by process for each of our existing ore bodies as of december 31 2016  



 32 

drill hole spacing data is used by mining professionals such as geologists and geological engineers in determining the suitability of data coverage on a relative basis in a given deposit type and mining method scenario so as to achieve a given level of confidence in the resource estimate drill hole spacing is only one of several criteria necessary to establish resource classification drilling programs are typically designed to achieve an optimum sample spacing to support the level of confidence in results that apply to a particular stage of development of a mineral deposit 

the following table sets forth the average drill hole spacing based on average sample distance or drill pattern spacing for proven and probable ore reserves by process type 



 33 

production sequencing 

the following chart illustrates our current plans for sequencing and producing our proven and probable reserves at each of our ore bodies and the years in which we currently expect production from each ore body and from related stockpiles the chart also shows the term of ptfis cow production volumes are typically lower in the first few years for each ore body as development activities are ongoing and as the mine ramps up to full production and production volumes may also be lower as the mine reaches the end of its life the sequencing dates shown in the chart below include development activity that results in metal production the ultimate timing of the start of production from our undeveloped mines is dependent upon a number of factors including the results of our exploration and development efforts and may vary from the dates shown below in addition we develop our mine plans based on maximizing the net present value from the ore bodies significant additional capital expenditures will be required at many of these mines in order to achieve the lifeofmine plans reflected below 

mill and leach stockpiles 

mill and leach stockpiles generally contain lower grade ores that have been extracted from an ore body and are available for copper recovery mill stockpiles contain sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through milling concentrating smelting and refining or alternatively by concentrate leaching leach stockpiles contain oxide ores and certain secondary sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities 

because it is generally impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count reasonable estimation methods are employed the quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grades of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles 

expected copper recovery rates for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing the recoverable copper in mill stockpiles once entered into the production process can be produced into copper concentrate almost immediately 

expected copper recovery rates for leach stockpiles are determined using smallscale laboratory tests small to largescale column testing which simulates the production process historical trends and other factors including mineralogy of the ore and rock type total copper recovery in leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low 

 34 

percentage to more than 90 percent depending on several variables including processing methodology processing variables mineralogy and particle size of the rock for newly placed material on active stockpiles as much as 80 percent of total copper recovery may be extracted during the first year and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years processes and recovery rates are monitored regularly and recovery rate estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes 

following are our stockpiles and the estimated recoverable copper contained within those stockpiles as of december 31 2016  

 

mineralized material 

we hold various properties containing mineralized material that we believe could be brought into production should market conditions warrant however permitting and significant capital expenditures would be required before operations could commence at these properties mineralized material is a mineralized body that has been delineated by appropriately spaced drilling andor underground sampling to support the reported tonnage and average metal grades such a deposit cannot qualify as recoverable proven and probable reserves until legal and economic feasibility are confirmed based upon a comprehensive evaluation of development costs unit costs grades recoveries and other material factors estimated mineralized materials as presented on the following page were assessed using prices of 220  per pound for copper 1000  per ounce for gold 12  per pound for molybdenum and 20 per ounce for silver

at december 31 2016  we owned interests in oil and gas leases covering 411 thousand  gross acres  218 thousand  acres net to our interest consisting of 325 thousand  gross  160 thousand  net of developed acres and 86 thousand  gross  58 thousand  net of undeveloped acres developed acres are acres spaced or assigned to productive wells and do not include undrilled acreage held by production under the terms of the lease undeveloped acres are acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil or gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves 

exploration and development activities 

capital expenditures for our oil and gas operations totaled 12 billion  in 2016  including 06 billion  incurred for gom and 05 billion for changes in capital expenditure accruals 30 billion  in 2015  including  26 billion  incurred for gom and 32 billion  in 2014 including 26 billion incurred for gom during secondquarter 2016 we terminated contracts for deepwater drillships and settled aggregate commitments totaling 11 billion for 755 million of which 540 million was funded with shares of our common stock we currently have no plans to incur oil and gas exploration expenditures in future periods

 item 1a risk factors 

this report contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of united states us federal securities laws forwardlooking statements are all statements other than statements of historical facts such as projections or expectations relating to ore grades and milling rates production and sales volumes unit net cash costs operating cash flows capital expenditures exploration efforts and results development and production activities and costs liquidity tax rates the impact of copper gold and molybdenum price changes the impact of deferred intercompany profits on earnings reserve estimates future dividend payments and share purchases and sales 

we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements we caution readers that forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated projected or assumed in the forwardlooking statements important factors that can cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements include the following 

financial risks 

declines in the market prices of copper and molybdenum have adversely affected our earnings cash flows and asset values and if sustained may adversely affect our ability to repay debt fluctuations in the market prices of copper gold and molybdenum have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in our financial performance and in the trading prices of our debt and common stock 

our financial results will vary with fluctuations in the market prices of the commodities we produce primarily copper and gold and to a lesser extent molybdenum as described below beginning in 2015 copper prices declined significantly before recovering in fourthquarter 2016 if prices decline in the future they may have a material adverse effect on our financial results the value of our assets andor our ability to repay our debt and meet our other fixed obligations and may depress the trading prices of our common stock and of our publicly traded debt securities 

in response to marketconditions beginning in the second half of 2015 we made adjustments to operating plans for our mining operations including reducing operating and capital costs and adjusting production at our north america copper mines reducing mining and stacking rates at our el abra mine in chile by approximately 50 percent to achieve lower operating and labor costs defer capital expenditures and extend the life of the operation and operating the henderson molybdenum mine in colorado at reduced rates if market prices for our primary commodities decline or persist at low levels we may have to further revise our operating plans including curtailing production reducing operating costs and capital expenditures and discontinuing certain exploration and development programs we may be unable to decrease our costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues in which case we may incur additional losses and those losses may be material 

fluctuations in commodities prices are caused by varied and complex factors beyond our control including global supply and demand balances and inventory levels global economic and political conditions international regulatory trade and tax policies commodities investment activity and speculation the price and availability of substitute products and changes in technology 

copper prices may be affected by demand from china which has become the largest consumer of refined copper in the world and by changes in demand for industrial commercial and residential products containing copper copper prices declined significantly during 2015 and remained low throughout most of 2016 with london metal exchange lme spot copper prices averaging 221  per pound in 2016 249 per pound in 2015 and 311 per pound in 2014 during fourthquarter 2016 copper prices improved with the lme spot price averaging 239 per pound the lme spot copper price was 250  per pound on december 31 2016  and 273  per pound on february 15 2017  

factors affecting gold prices may include the relative strength of the us dollar to other currencies inflation and interest rate expectations purchases and sales of gold by governments and central banks demand from china and india two of the world ’ s largest consumers of gold and global demand for jewelry containing gold the london pm gold price averaged 1250  per ounce in 2016 1160 per ounce in 2015 and 1266 per ounce in 2014 the london pm gold price was 1224  per ounce on february 15 2017  

 39 

molybdenum prices also declined significantly during 2015 and have remained low throughout 2016 with the metals week  molybdenum dealer oxide weekly average price averaging 647  per pound in 2016 666 per pound in 2015 and 1141 per pound in 2014 the metals week  molybdenum dealer oxide weekly average price was 759  per pound on february 15 2017  

lower copper and molybdenum prices during 2016 and 2015 resulted in noncash charges for inventory adjustments  36 million  for the year 2016 and 338 million for the year 2015 and longlived mining asset impairments  37 million  for the year 2015 refer to notes 4 and 5 for additional information declines in copper andor molybdenum prices could result in additional metals inventory adjustments and impairment charges for our longlived assets other events that could result in impairment of our longlived assets include but are not limited to decreases in estimated proven and probable mineral reserves and any event that might have a material adverse effect on mine production costs 

our debt and other financial commitments may limit our financial and operating flexibility 

at december 31 2016  our total consolidated debt was  160 billion  see note 8 and our total consolidated cash was 42 billion  we also have various other financial commitments including reclamation and environmental obligations takeorpay contracts and leases our level of indebtedness and other financial commitments could have important consequences to our business including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

any failure to comply with the financial and other covenants in our debt agreements may result in an event of default that would allow the creditors to accelerate maturities of the related debt which in turn may trigger crossacceleration or crossdefault provisions in other debt agreements our available cash and liquidity would not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our debt instruments that are accelerated upon an event of default 

from august 2015 through november 2016 we sold 3265 million shares of our common stock under registered atthemarket equity programs which generated 35 billion in gross proceeds refer to note 10 in addition during 2016 we issued 481 million  shares of our common stock in connection with the settlement of two drilling rig contracts refer to note 13 and 277 million  shares of our common stock in exchange for 369 million  of fcx senior notes refer to note 10 any additional issuance of equity capital to fund operations reduce debt improve our financial position or for other purposes may have a negative impact on our stock price 

as of february 15 2017  our senior unsecured debt was rated bb with a stable outlook by standard  poor’s sp bbb with a negative outlook by fitch ratings fitch and b1 with a positive outlook by moody’s investors service moodys there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not be downgraded in the future for more information refer to the risk factor below relating to mine closure and reclamation regulations and plugging and abandonment obligations related to our remaining oil and gas operations 

 40 

mine closure and reclamation regulations impose substantial costs on our operations and include requirements that we provide financial assurance supporting those obligations we also have plugging and abandonment obligations related to our remaining oil and gas properties and are required to provide bonds or other forms of financial assurance in connection with those operations   changes in or the failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us 

we are required by us federal and state laws and regulations to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans for our mining properties if we are unable to do so the us environmental protection agency epa and state agencies may also require financial assurance for investigation and remediation actions that are required under settlements of enforcement actions under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 cercla or similar state laws refer to note 12 for additional information regarding our financial assurance obligations 

with respect to our mining operations most of our financial assurance obligations are imposed by state laws that vary significantly by jurisdiction depending on how each state regulates land use and groundwater quality although section 108b of cercla has required epa to identify classes of facilities that must establish evidence of financial responsibility since it was adopted in 1980 currently there are no financial assurance requirements for active mining operations under cercla in august 2014 several environmental organizations initiated litigation against epa to require it to set a schedule for adopting financial assurance regulations under cercla governing the hard rock mining industry epa and the environmental organizations reached a joint agreement and submitted it to the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit for approval notwithstanding industry objections the court approved the agreement on january 29 2016 thereby requiring the epa to propose financial assurance regulations for the hard rock mining industry by december 1 2016 and to provide notice of its final action by december 1 2017 the proposed regulations were published on january 11 2017 subject to a 60day comment period the proposed rules if promulgated without material modification would result in onerous financial responsibility obligations for our us hard rock mining operations and the form cost and availability of financial mechanisms necessary to meet such obligations is uncertain if they could be met at all in addition complying with these obligations could be very costly harm the international competitiveness of our us hard rock mining operations and could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

we are also subject to financial assurance requirements in connection with our remaining oil and gas operations under both state and federal laws including financial responsibility required under the oil pollution act of 1990 to cover containment and cleanup costs resulting from an oil spill in 2016 the us bureau of ocean energy management issued revised requirements for lessees operating in federal waters to secure the cost of plugging abandoning decommissioning andor removing wells platforms and pipelines at the end of production the revised requirements eliminate previously provided waivers from requirements to post security the new requirements to post significant amounts of security in the form of bonds or similar assurances could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition the cost for bonds or assurances can be substantial and there is no assurance that they can be obtained in all cases 

as of december 31 2016  our financial assurance obligations totaled 11 billion  for closure and reclamationrestoration costs of us mining sites and 07 billion  for plugging and abandonment obligations of our remaining oil and gas operations refer to note 12 a substantial portion of our financial assurance obligations are satisfied by fcx guarantees and financial capability demonstrations as a result of the downgrade of our credit ratings on our debt to below investment grade by sp and moody’s we may be required to provide additional or alternative forms of financial assurance such as letters of credit surety bonds or collateral these other forms of assurance are costly to provide and depending on our financial condition and market conditions may be difficult or impossible to obtain failure to provide the required financial assurance could result in the closure of the affected properties 

refer to notes 1 and 12  for further discussion of our environmental and asset retirement obligations 

unanticipated litigation or negative developments in pending litigation or with respect to other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

we are involved in numerous legal proceedings and subject to other contingencies that have arisen or may arise in the ordinary course of our business or are associated with environmental issues arising from legacy operations conducted over the years by freeport minerals corporation fmc and its affiliates including those described in 

 41 

note 12 and in item 3 legal proceedings involving matters such as remediation restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination claims of personal injury or property damage arising from such contamination or from exposure to substances such as lead arsenic asbestos talc and other allegedly toxic substances disputes over water rights and disputes with foreign governments or regulatory authorities over royalties taxes rights and obligations under concession or other agreements or other matters we are also involved periodically in other reviews inquiries   investigations and other proceedings initiated by or involving government agencies some of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief in addition from time to time we are involved in disputes over the allocation of environmental remediation obligations at superfund and other sites the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant monetary damages penalties other sanctions or injunctive relief against us limitations on our property rights or regulatory interpretations that increase our operating costs management does not believe based on currently available information that the outcome of any individual legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition although individual or cumulative outcomes could be material to our operating results for a particular period depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period 

with respect to the asbestos exposure cases described in note 12 there has been an increase in the number of cases against fmc and its affiliates alleging exposure to talc contaminated with asbestos and to talc that is not alleged to be contaminated with asbestos recently there have been a limited number of large jury awards in single plaintiff cases primarily brought by consumers against makers of common consumer products containing talc and alleging serious health risks including ovarian cancer associated with longterm use of such products prior affiliates were involved in talc mining and some of those affiliates have been named as defendants in some of those cases we have indemnification rights against a successor to those businesses and the successor has acknowledged those indemnification obligations and has taken responsibility for all cases we have tendered to it however the indemnitor may have limited financial resources and limited amounts of insurance available to meet those obligations 

international risks 

our international operations are subject to political social and geographic risks of doing business in countries outside the us 

we are a usbased mining company with substantial assets located outside of the us we conduct international mining operations in indonesia peru and chile accordingly in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in countries outside the us our business may be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties in each of these countries risks of conducting business in countries outside of the us include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 42 

 

our insurance does not cover most losses caused by the above described risks accordingly our exploration development and production activities outside of the us may be substantially affected by many unpredictable factors beyond our control some of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

our international operations must comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption and antibribery laws of the other jurisdictions in which we operate there has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of these laws in recent years and a steadily increasing focus on enforcement of those laws continues any violation of those laws could result in significant criminal or civil fines and penalties litigation and loss of operating licenses or permits and may damage our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

we are involved in several significant tax proceedings and other tax disputes with the indonesian and peruvian tax authorities refer to note 12  for further discussion of these matters other risks specific to certain countries in which we operate are discussed in more detail below 

because our grasberg mining operation in indonesia is a significant operating asset our business may continue to be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties in indonesia 

our mining operations in indonesia are conducted by our subsidiary pt freeport indonesia ptfi pursuant to a contract of work cow with the indonesian government maintaining a good working relationship with the indonesian government is important to us because of the significance of our indonesia operations to our business and because our mining operations there are among indonesias most significant business enterprises partially because of their significance to indonesias economy the environmentally sensitive area in which they are located and the number of people employed our indonesia operations have been the subject of political debates and of criticism in the indonesian press and have been the target of protests and occasional violence for further discussion of the history of ptfis cow refer to note 13  

the initial term of ptfis cow expires in 2021 but the cow explicitly provides that it can be extended for two 10year periods subject to indonesian government approval which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably ptfi has been engaged in discussions with officials of the indonesian government since 2012 regarding various provisions of its cow including extending its term notwithstanding provisions in the cow prohibiting it from doing so the indonesian government has sought to modify existing mining contracts including ptfi’s cow to address provisions contained in the mining law enacted in 2009 and mining regulations adopted thereunder including provisions that conflict with the cow such as the size of contract concessions government revenues domestic processing of minerals divestment provision of local goods and services conversion from a cow to a licensing framework for extension periods and a requirement that extensions may be applied for only within two years prior to a cow’s expiration 

  

regulations published in january 2014 imposed among other things a progressive export duty on copper concentrate and restricted exports of copper concentrate and anode slimes a byproduct of the copper refining process containing metals including gold after january 12 2017 despite ptfi’s rights under its cow to export concentrate without the payment of duties ptfi was unable to obtain administrative approval for exports and operated at approximately half of its capacity from midjanuary 2014 through july 2014 

in july 2014 ptfi entered into a memorandum of understanding mou with the indonesian government in which subject to concluding an agreement to extend ptfis operations beyond 2021 on acceptable terms ptfi agreed to construct new smelter capacity in indonesia and to divest an additional 2064 percent interest at fair value under the mou ptfi provided a 115 million assurance bond to support its commitment for smelter development agreed to pay higher royalty rates and agreed to pay export duties until certain smelter development milestones were met the mou also anticipated an amendment of the cow within six months to address other matters however no terms of the cow other than those relating to the smelter bond increased royalties and export duties were changed in january 2015 the mou was extended to july 25 2015 and it expired on that date the indonesian government has continued to impose the increased royalty rates export duties and smelter assurance bond 

 43 

in october 2015 the indonesian government provided a letter of assurance to ptfi indicating that it would revise regulations allowing it to approve the extension of ptfis operations beyond 2021 and provide the same rights and the same level of legal and fiscal certainty provided under the current cow 

in january and february 2017 the indonesian government issued new regulations to address exports of unrefined metals including copper concentrate and anode slimes and other matters related to the mining sector the new regulations permit the continuation of copper concentrate exports for a fiveyear period through january 2022 subject to various conditions including conversion from a contract of work to a special operating license known as an iupk which provides virtually none of the protections of a contract of work commitment to completion of smelter construction in five years and payment of export duties to be determined by the ministry of finance in addition the new regulations enable application for extension of operating rights five years before expiration of the iupk and require foreign iupk holders to divest 51 percent to indonesian interests no later than the tenth year of production export licenses would be valid for oneyear periods subject to review every six months depending on smelter construction progress 

the january 2017 regulations permit the export of anode slimes which is necessary for pt smelting ptfi’s 25percentowned copper smelter and refinery located in gresik indonesia to continue operating pt smelting is seeking to renew its anode slimes export license however we cannot predict when pt smelting’s anode slimes export license may be renewed in addition a labor strike at pt smelting has resulted in a shutdown of its operations since january 19 2017 although ptfi is taking nearterm actions to reduce production to match available processing capacity at pt smelting or approximately 40 percent of ptfis concentrate production capacity on february 10 2017 ptfi was forced to suspend production as a result of limited storage capacity at ptfi and pt smelting pt smelting has indicated that it expects to resume operations in march 2017 delays in pt smelting obtaining its anode slimes export license or restarting operations could further impact ptfis operations 

following the issuance of the january and february 2017 regulations and discussions with the government ptfi advised the indonesian government that it was prepared to convert its cow to an iupk subject to obtaining an investment stability agreement providing equivalent rights with the same level of legal and fiscal certainty enumerated under its cow and provided that the cow would remain in effect until it is replaced by a mutually satisfactory alternative ptfi also committed to commence construction of a new smelter during a fiveyear timeframe after approval of the extension of its longterm operating rights 

under its cow ptfi has specified rights to export copper concentrate without restriction or payment of export duties ptfi has requested that concentrate exports be permitted without the imposition of export duties while the new license and stability agreement are negotiated the indonesia government has indicated that in order to export its concentrate production ptfi would be required to immediately convert to an iupk forgo its current rights to fiscal and legal certainty and commit to a new smelter prior to completing a longterm investment stability agreement ptfi has advised the indonesian government that attempts to enforce the new regulations on ptfi violates its cow and that it is unwilling to terminate its cow unless replaced by a mutually acceptable form of agreement providing fiscal and legal assurances to support its longterm investment plans in papua indonesia 

as of february 24 2017  ptfi has not obtained approval to export concentrate and production remains suspended ptfi is taking nearterm actions to reduce production to match available processing capacity at pt smelting or approximately 40 percent of ptfis concentrate production capacity assuming that pt smeltings export license is approved and its operations are resumed in march 2017 ptfi has begun to significantly adjust its cost structure reduce its workforce and spending with local suppliers and suspend investments in its underground development projects and new smelter 

  

on february 17 2017 pursuant to the cow’s dispute resolution provisions ptfi provided formal notice to the indonesian government of an impending dispute listing the government’s breaches and violations of the cow as described in the risk factor below “ptfis cow may be subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations and if a dispute arises we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of an international arbitration panel” 

we cannot predict whether or when ptfi will be able to resume exporting copper concentrate for each month of delay in obtaining approval to export ptfi’s share of production is projected to be reduced by approximately 70 million pounds of copper and 70 thousand ounces of gold the inability of either ptfi to export copper concentrate or pt smelting to export anode slimes or restart operations for any extended period of time would lead to the 

 44 

continued suspension of production in indonesia which would have a material adverse effect on our cash flow results of operations and financial position and could result in asset impairments inventory write downs difficulty in meeting covenants under our credit facilities and a significant reduction in our reported mineral reserves 

we also cannot predict whether ptfi will be successful in reaching a satisfactory agreement on the terms of its longterm mining rights if ptfi is unable to reach agreement with the indonesian government on its longterm rights we may be required to reduce or defer investments in underground development projects which would have a material adverse effect on our future production cash flow results of operations and financial position and could result in asset impairments inventory write downs difficulty in meeting covenants under our credit facilities and a significant reduction in our reported mineral reserves 

  

in october 2016 a new minister of energy and mineral resources was appointed and is the fourth person to hold the office since july 2016 we cannot predict what impact the transition will have on the progress or outcome of ptfi’s license and stability agreement negotiations 

ptfis cow may be subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations and if a dispute arises we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of an international arbitration panel 

ptfis cow was entered into under indonesias 1967 foreign capital investment law which provides guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization the cow may be subject to termination by the indonesian government if we do not satisfy our contractual obligations which include the payment of royalties and taxes to the government and the satisfaction of certain mining environmental safety and health requirements 

recently adopted indonesian laws and regulations conflict with the mining rights established under the cow although the cow grants to ptfi the unencumbered right to operate in accordance with the cow government agencies have sought and continue to seek to impose additional restrictions on ptfi that could affect exploration and operating requirements for further discussion refer to the above risk factor because our grasberg mining operation in indonesia is a significant operating asset our business may continue to be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties in indonesia 

ptfis cow requires that disputes with the indonesian government be submitted to international arbitration on february 17 2017 pursuant to the cow’s formal dispute resolution provisions ptfi provided formal notice to the indonesian government of an impending dispute listing the government’s breaches and violations of the cow including but not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if the dispute is not resolved by june 17 2017 ptfi may commence arbitration under the united nations commission on international trade law uncitral arbitration rules to enforce all provisions of the cow and seek damages specifically in respect of the issuance of the january 11 2017 regulations which are not in accordance with honoring the contractual commitments of the indonesian government and ptfi under the cow the arbitration proceedings would take place in jakarta indonesia and for limited purposes would be overseen by the indonesian courts under the indonesian arbitration act the international arbitration process is complex and could take considerable time to complete and there is no assurance that we will prevail if we prevail we will face the additional risk of having to enforce the judgment of an international arbitration panel against indonesia within its own territory additionally our operations may be materially and adversely affected while resolution of a dispute is pending 

 45 

at times certain government officials and others in indonesia have questioned the validity of contracts entered into by the indonesian government prior to may 1998  ie  during the suharto regime which lasted over 30   years including ptfis cow which was signed in december 1991 we cannot provide assurance that the validity of or our compliance with the cow will not be challenged for political or other reasons 

we will not mine all of our ore reserves in indonesia before the initial term of our cow expires 

our proven and probable ore reserves in indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041 and our current mine plan and planned operations are based on the assumption that we will receive the two 10year extensions as a result we will not mine all of these ore reserves during the initial term of the current cow prior to the end of 2021 we expect to mine 17 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable ore at december 31 2016  representing 22 percent of ptfis share of recoverable copper reserves and 33 percent of its share of recoverable gold reserves there can be no assurance that the indonesian government will approve our cow extensions for further discussion refer to the above risk factors because our grasberg mining operation in indonesia is a significant operating asset our business may continue to be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties in indonesia and ptfis cow may be subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations and if a dispute arises we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of an international arbitration panel 

operational risks 

our mining operations are subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our business 

our mines are very large in scale and by their nature are subject to significant operational risks some of which are outside of our control and many of which are not covered fully or in some cases even partially by insurance these operational risks which could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and cash flow include earthquakes rainstorms floods and other natural disasters equipment failures accidents wall failures and rock slides in our openpit mines and structural collapses of our underground mines or tailings impoundments and lower than expected ore grades or recovery rates 

the waste rock including overburden and tailings produced in our mining operations represent our largest volume of waste managing the volume of waste rock and tailings presents significant environmental safety and engineering challenges and risks we maintain large leach pads and tailings impoundments containing viscous material which are effectively large dams that must be engineered constructed and monitored to assure structural stability and avoid leakages or structural collapse our tailings impoundments in arid areas must have effective programs to suppress fugitive dust emissions and we must effectively monitor and treat acid rock drainage at all of our operations in indonesia we use a river transport system for tailings management which presents other risks as discussed below 

the failure of tailings and other impoundments at any of our mining operations could cause severe property and environmental damage and loss of life and we apply significant financial resources and both internal and external technical resources to the effective safe management of all those facilities the importance of careful design management and monitoring of large impoundments was emphasized in recent years by large scale tailings dam failures at unaffiliated mines which caused extensive property and environmental damage and resulted in the loss of life as a member company of the international council on mining and metals icmm we intend to augment our existing practices to be consistent with the icmm’s tailings governance framework adopted in december 2016 in an effort to reduce the risk of catastrophic failure of tailings storage facilities 

labor unrest activism and civil and religious strife could disrupt our operations and may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

as of december 31 2016  approximately half of our global labor force was covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately one third of our global labor force was covered by agreements that have expired and are currently being negotiated or will expire during 2017 including the agreement covering employees at our ptfi operations in indonesia 

labor agreements are negotiated on a periodic basis and may not be renewed on reasonably satisfactory terms to us or at all if we do not successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements with our union workers we 

 46 

may incur prolonged strikes and other work stoppages at our mining operations which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations additionally if we enter into a new labor agreement with any union that significantly increases our labor costs relative to our competitors our ability to compete may be materially and adversely affected refer to items 1 and 2 business and properties for additional information regarding labor matters and expiration dates of such agreements 

we could also experience labor disruptions such as work stoppages work slowdowns union organizing campaigns strikes or lockouts that could adversely affect our operations for example in october 2014 a large percentage of grasberg openpit operators did not report to their scheduled shifts and during thirdquarter 2016 ptfi experienced labor productivity issues and a 10day work stoppage that began in late september 2016 these labor productivity issues have continued during fourthquarter 2016 and early 2017 and could be heightened by the workforce reductions that began in february 2017 significant reductions in productivity or protracted work stoppages at one or more of our operations could significantly reduce our production and sales volumes which could adversely affect our cash flow results of operations and financial condition 

indonesia has long faced separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces several separatist groups have sought increased political independence for the province of papua where our grasberg minerals district is located in papua there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the indonesian military in addition illegal miners have periodically clashed with police who have attempted for years to move them away from our facilities social economic and political instability in papua could materially and adversely affect us if it results in damage to our property or interruption of our indonesia operations 

in 2009 a series of shooting incidents occurred within the ptfi project area including along the road leading to our mining and milling operations the shooting incidents have continued on a sporadic basis with the last incident occurring on january 1 2015 during this time there were 20 fatalities and 59 injuries to our employees contractor employees government security personnel and civilians to date no one person or group has claimed responsibility for the shootings the safety of our workforce is a critical concern and ptfi continues to work with the indonesian government to address security issues the investigation of these incidents is ongoing we also continue to limit the use of the road leading to our mining and milling operations to secured convoys 

we cannot predict whether additional incidents will occur that could disrupt or suspend our indonesian operations if other disruptive incidents occur they could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in ways that we cannot predict at this time 

our mining operations depend on the availability of secure water supplies 

our mining operations require physical availability and secure legal rights to significant quantities of water for mining and ore processing activities and related support facilities most of our north and south america mining operations are in areas where competition for water supplies is significant continuous production at our mines is dependent on many factors including our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies 

in arizona where our operations use both surface and ground water we are a participant in an active general stream adjudication in which the arizona courts have been attempting for over 40 years to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for the gila river one of the states largest river systems which primarily affects our morenci safford and sierrita mines the adjudication is addressing the state law claims of thousands of competing users including us as well as significant federal water claims that are potentially adverse to the state law claims of both surface water and groundwater users groundwater is treated differently from surface water under arizona law which historically allowed land owners to pump unlimited quantities of subsurface water subject only to the requirement of putting it to reasonable use however court decisions in the adjudication have concluded that underground water is often hydrologically connected to surface water so that it actually is surface water and is therefore subject to the arizona doctrine of prior appropriation as a result of which it would be subject to the adjudication and potentially unavailable to groundwater pumpers in the absence of valid surface water claims which historic groundwater pumpers typically do not have any recharacterization of groundwater as surface water could affect the ability of consumers farmers ranchers municipalities and industrial users like us to continue to access water supplies that have been relied on for decades because we are a user of both groundwater and surface water in arizona we are an active participant in the adjudication proceeding

water for our cerro verde operation in peru comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the rio chili watershed that collects water primarily from seasonal precipitation as a result of occasional drought conditions temporary supply shortages are possible that could affect our cerro verde operations in january 2016 the peruvian government declared a temporary state of emergency with respect to the water supply in the rio chili basin because of drought conditions as a result the cerro verde water rights from the rio chili were temporarily decreased during february 2016 

water for our el abra mining operation in chile comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascotán aquifer in 2010 el abra obtained regulatory approval for the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascotán aquifer for its sulfide processing plant which began operations in 2011 the agreement to pump from this aquifer is subject to continued monitoring of the aquifer level to ensure that environmentally sensitive areas are not impacted by our pumping if impact occurs we would have to reduce pumping to restore water levels which could have an adverse effect on production from el abra 

although we typically have sufficient water for our indonesian operations lower rainfall resulting from el niño weather conditions affected operations in the second half of 2015 and may do so again in the future 

although each of our mining operations currently has access to sufficient water supplies to support current operational demands as discussed above some supplies are subject to adjudication proceedings the outcome of which we cannot predict and the availability of additional supplies that may be required for potential future expansions is uncertain while we are taking actions to acquire additional backup water supples such supplies may not be available at acceptable cost or at all so that the loss of a water right or currently available water supply could force us to curtail operations or force premature closures thereby increasing andor accelerating costs or foregoing profitable operations 

in addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry our indonesia mining operations involve additional risks because they are located in very remote areas and on unusually difficult terrain 

the grasberg minerals district is located in steep mountainous terrain in a remote area of indonesia these conditions have required us to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities in addition the area receives considerable rainfall which has led to periodic floods and mudslides the mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time our insurance may not sufficiently cover an unexpected natural or operating disaster 

underground mining operations can be particularly dangerous and in may 2013 a tragic accident which resulted in 28 fatalities and 10 injuries occurred at ptfi when the rock structure above the underground ceiling of a training facility collapsed ptfi temporarily suspended mining and processing activities at the grasberg complex to conduct inspections and resumed openpit mining and concentrating activities on june 24 2013 and underground operations on july 9 2013 no assurance can be given that similar events will not occur in the future 

we must continually replace reserves depleted by production but our exploration activities may not result in additional discoveries 

our existing mineral reserves will be depleted over time by production from our operations because our profits are primarily derived from our mining operations our ability to replenish our mineral reserves is essential to our longterm success our exploration projects involve many risks require substantial expenditures and may not result in the discovery of additional deposits that can be produced profitably we may not be able to discover enhance develop or acquire reserves in sufficient quantities to maintain or grow our current reserve levels which could negatively affect our cash flow results of operations and financial condition 

development projects are inherently risky and may require more capital than anticipated which could adversely affect our business 

consolidated capital expenditures are expected to approximate 18 billion  for 2017 including 11 billion  for major projects primarily associated with underground development activities at grasberg and 07 billion  for sustaining capital refer to the risk factor because our grasberg mining operation in indonesia is a significant operating asset our business may continue to be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties in indonesia for further discussion of regulatory matters in indonesia that may impact future investments in ptfis underground development projects 

 48 

there are many risks and uncertainties inherent in all development projects the economic feasibility of development projects is based on many factors including the accuracy of estimated reserves estimated capital and operating costs and estimated future prices of the relevant commodity the capital expenditures and time required to develop new mines or other projects are considerable and changes in costs or timing can adversely affect project economics 

new development projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future cash flow the actual costs production rates and economic returns of our development projects may differ materially from our estimates which may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

our operations are subject to extensive regulations some of which require permits and other approvals these regulations increase our costs and in some circumstances may delay or suspend our operations 

our operations are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations that are subject to change and to changing interpretation by governmental agencies and other bodies vested with broad supervisory authority as a natural resource company compliance with environmental legal requirements is an integral and costly part of our business for additional information see environmental risks below we are also subject to extensive regulation of worker health and safety including the requirements of the us occupational safety and health act and similar laws of other jurisdictions in the us the operation of our mines is subject to regulation by the us mine safety and health administration msha under the federal mine safety and health act of 1977 msha inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred if such inspections result in an alleged violation we may be subject to fines and penalties and in instances of alleged significant violations our mining operations could be subject to temporary or extended closures 

many other governmental bodies regulate other aspects of our operations and our failure to comply with these legal requirements can result in substantial penalties in addition new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations by courts or regulatory authorities occur regularly but are difficult to predict any such variations could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow results of operations and financial condition 

our business may be adversely affected by information technology disruptions 

cybersecurity incidents are increasing in frequency evolving in nature and include but are not limited to installation of malicious software unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data we have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past and may experience them in the future we believe we have implemented appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks however given the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of information technology disruptions we could be subject to manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow results of operations and financial condition 

environmental risks 

our operations are subject to complex evolving and increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations compliance with environmental regulatory requirements involves significant costs and may constrain existing operations or expansion opportunities 

our operations both in the us and internationally are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing the generation storage treatment transportation and disposal of hazardous substances solid waste disposal air emissions wastewater discharges remediation restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination including mine closures and reclamation well plug and abandonment requirements protection of endangered and protected species and designation of critical habitats and other related matters in addition we must obtain regulatory permits and approvals to start continue and expand operations 

our miami arizona smelter processes approximately half of the aggregate copper concentrate produced by our north america copper mines epa regulations require us to invest in new pollution control equipment to reduce sulfur dioxide so 2  to meet both regional haze requirements and to allow the state of arizona to demonstrate compliance with epas so 2  ambient air quality standards the deadline for the smelter to install the so 2 pollution 

 49 

control equipment to comply with the regional haze rules is january 1 2018 arizona regulators have promulgated rules for complying with the national ambient air quality standards which must be approved by the epa to become effective but it is possible that they will be effective prior to january 1 2018 in order to meet both regulatory requirements we expect capital expenditures to approximate 250 million and we expect those expenditures to be made through 2018 if these expenditures are delayed or deferred for technical financial or any other reasons we may be forced to curtail production at the miami smelter which would require us to export concentrate rather than process it ourselves and to purchase sulphuric acid that would otherwise be generated during the smelting process which would result in increased production costs 

laws such as cercla and similar state laws may expose us to joint and several liability for environmental damages caused by our operations or by previous owners or operators of properties we acquired or are currently operating or at sites where we sent materials for processing recycling or disposal as discussed in more detail in the next risk factor we have substantial obligations for environmental remediation on mining properties previously owned or operated by fmc and certain of its affiliates noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in material penalties or other liabilities in addition compliance with these laws may from time to time result in delays in or changes to our development or expansion plans compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs which we expect will continue to increase over time because of increased regulatory oversight adoption of increasingly stringent environmental standards as well as other factors 

new or revised environmental regulatory requirements are frequently proposed many of which result in substantially increased costs for our business including those regarding financial assurance in the financial risk factor above in addition in 2015 the epa promulgated rules that could reclassify certain mineral processing materials as hazardous waste under the federal resource conservation and recovery act and subject the industry to significant new and costly waste management requirements these rules are currently being challenged by multiple parties in court however if the legal challenges are unsuccessful and the regulatory agencies reclassify certain mineral processing materials as “hazardous waste costs at our us copper and molybdenum processing facilities could materially increase 

the epa has also adopted rules that bring remote “tributaries” into the regulatory definition of “waters of the united states” that are protected by the clean water act thereby imposing significant additional restrictions on waterway discharges and land uses and is in many ways aggressively attempting to expand its regulatory authority over air quality water quality and solid wastes among other things these rules are being litigated by multiple parties regulations are also being considered at various governmental levels to increase federal financial responsibility requirements both for mine closure and reclamation and for oil and gas decommissioning and to increase regulation of or prohibit hydraulic fracturing adoption of these or similar new environmental regulations or more stringent application of existing regulations may materially increase our costs threaten certain operating activities and constrain our expansion opportunities 

in february 2016 the department of the interiors fish  wildlife service fws adopted final rules that broaden the regulatory definitions of critical habitat and destruction or adverse modification both of which are integral to the fwss implementation of the endangered species act which protects federallylisted endangered and threatened species the new rules increase fwss discretion to limit uses of land and water courses that may become suitable habitat for listed species in the future or that are occasionally used by protected species the new rules may limit the ability of landowners including us to obtain federal permits or authorizations needed for expansion of our operations and may also affect our ability to obtain retain or deliver water to some operations 

we incurred environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs including our joint venture partners shares to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect our operations totaling 04 billion in each of 2016 2015 and 2014 for 2017  we expect to incur approximately 06 billion  of aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs which includes expenditures for the miami smelter pollution control equipment discussed above the timing and amounts of estimated payments could change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements changes in scope and costs of reclamation and plug and abandonment activities the settlement of environmental matters and the rate at which actual spending occurs on continuing matters 

 50 

we incur significant costs for remediating environmental conditions on properties that have not been operated in many years 

fmc and its subsidiaries and many of their affiliates and predecessor companies have been involved in exploration mining milling smelting and manufacturing in the us for more than a century activities that occurred in the late 19th century and the 20th century prior to the advent of modern environmental laws were not subject to environmental regulation and were conducted before american industrial companies fully understood the longterm effects of their operations on the surrounding environment 

with the passage of cercla in 1980 companies like fmc became legally responsible for remediating hazardous substances released into the environment from properties owned or operated by them as well as properties where they arranged for disposal of such substances irrespective of when the release to the environment occurred or who caused it that liability is often asserted on a joint and several basis with other prior and subsequent owners operators and arrangers meaning that each owner or operator of the property is and each arranger may be held fully responsible for the remediation although in many cases some or all of the other responsible parties no longer exist do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found as a result because of our acquisition of fmc in 2007 many of the subsidiary companies we now own are potentially responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the us and we expect to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those remediation issues we are also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources at december 31 2016  we had more than 100  active remediation projects in 26  us states in addition fmc and certain affiliates and predecessor companies were parties to agreements relating to the transfer of businesses or properties that contained indemnification provisions relating to environmental matters and from time to time these provisions become the source of claims against us 

at december 31 2016  we had 12 billion  recorded in our consolidated balance sheet for environmental obligations attributable to cercla or analogous state programs and for estimated future costs associated with environmental matters at closed facilities or closed portions of operating facilities our environmental obligation estimates are primarily based upon 

 

 

 

significant adjustments to these estimates are likely to occur in the future as additional information becomes available the actual environmental costs may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs and any such changes could be material 

in addition remediation standards imposed by the epa and state environmental agencies have generally become more stringent over time and may become even more stringent in the future imposition of more stringent remediation standards particularly for arsenic and lead in soils poses a risk that additional remediation work could be required at our active remediation sites and at sites that we have already remediated to the satisfaction of the responsible governmental agencies and may increase the risk of toxic tort litigation 

refer to note 12  for further discussion of our environmental obligations 

our indonesia mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges and future changes in environmental laws or unanticipated environmental impacts from those operations could require us to incur increased costs 

mining operations on the scale of our indonesia operations involve significant environmental risks and challenges our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of crushed and ground rock material called tailings that results from the process by which we physically separate the copper gold and silverbearing materials from the 

 51 

ore that we mine our tailings management plan which has been approved by the indonesian government uses the unnavigable river system in the highlands near our mine to transport the tailings to an engineered area in the lowlands where the tailings and natural sediments are managed in a deposition area lateral levees have been constructed to help contain the footprint of the tailings and to limit their impact in the lowlands 

another major environmental challenge is managing overburden which is the rock that must be moved aside in the mining process to reach the ore in the presence of air water and naturally occurring bacteria some overburden can generate acid rock drainage or acidic water containing dissolved metals that if not properly managed can adversely affect the environment in addition overburden stockpiles are subject to erosion caused by the large amounts of rainfall with the eroded stockpile material eventually being deposited in the lowlands tailings management area this additional material while predicted in our environmental studies influences the deposition of finer tailings material in the estuary 

from time to time certain indonesian government officials have raised questions with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans including a suggestion that we implement a pipeline system rather than the river transport system for tailings management and disposition because our indonesia mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area a pipeline system would be costly difficult to construct and maintain and more prone to catastrophic failure and could therefore involve significant potentially adverse environmental issues based on our own studies and others conducted by third parties we do not believe that a pipeline system is necessary or practical 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change issues may increase our costs and adversely   affect our operations 

carbonbased energy is a significant input in our operations and our revenues include sales of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas and other carbonbased energy products the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would vary by operation based on particular geographic circumstances as a result of the paris agreement reached during the 21 st  conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change in 2015 a number of governments have pledged nationally determined contributions to control and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the us epa has finalized regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions from new modified and existing power plants while these rules are being challenged in court increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may increase our costs 

other risks 

our holding company structure may impact our ability to service debt and our stockholders ’  ability to receive dividends  

we are a holding company with no material assets other than the capital stock and intercompany receivables of our subsidiaries as a result our ability to repay our indebtedness and pay dividends is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend loan debt repayment or otherwise our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to make funds available to us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends dividends from subsidiaries that are not wholly owned are shared with other equity owners cash at our international operations is also typically subject to foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation into the us 

in addition our subsidiaries may not be able to or be permitted to make distributions to us or repay loans to us to enable us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal restrictions as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries certain of our subsidiaries are parties to credit agreements that restrict their ability to make distributions or loan repayments to us if such subsidiary is in default under such agreements to repay any subordinated loan we may make to such subsidiary unless specified conditions are met or to transfer substantially all of the assets of such subsidiary without the consent of the lenders 

our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries assets upon their liquidation reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries creditors including any trade creditors 

 52 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult these provisions 

 

 

 

 

these provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by the board 

in addition because we are incorporated in delaware we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with or acquisition of us 

these provisions may deter an acquisition of us that might otherwise be attractive to stockholders

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in numerous legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business or are associated with environmental issues arising from legacy operations conducted over the years by freeport minerals corporation fmc and its affiliates we are also involved periodically in reviews inquiries investigations and other proceedings initiated by or involving government agencies some of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief management does not believe based on currently available information that the outcome of any legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition although individual outcomes could be material to our operating results for a particular period depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period below is a discussion of our material water rights legal proceedings refer to note 12  for discussion of our other material legal proceedings 

water rights legal proceedings 

our operations in the western united states us require significant secure quantities of water for mining ore processing and related support facilities continuous operation of our mines is dependent on among other things our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies in the arid western us where certain of our mines are located water rights are often contested and disputes over water rights are generally timeconsuming expensive and not necessarily dispositive unless they resolve both actual and potential claims the loss of a water right or a currently available water supply could force us to curtail operations or force premature closures thereby increasing andor accelerating costs or foregoing profitable operations 

at our north america operations certain of our water supplies are supported by surface water rights which give us the right to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location in arizona where our 

 53 

operations use both surface and groundwater we are a participant in an active general stream adjudication in which the arizona courts have been attempting for over 40 years to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for the gila river one of the states largest river systems which primarily affect our morenci safford and sierrita mines the adjudication is addressing the state law claims of thousands of competing users including us as well as significant federal water claims that are potentially adverse to the state law claims of both surface water and groundwater users groundwater is treated differently from surface water under arizona law which historically allowed land owners to pump unlimited quantities of subsurface water subject only to the requirement of putting it to reasonable use however court decisions in the adjudication have concluded that underground water is often hydrologically connected to surface water so that it actually is surface water and is therefore subject to the arizona doctrine of prior appropriation as a result of which it would be subject to the adjudication and potentially unavailable to groundwater pumpers in the absence of valid surface water claims which historic groundwater pumpers typically do not have any recharacterization of groundwater as surface water could affect the ability of consumers farmers ranchers municipalities and industrial users like us to continue to access water supplies that have been relied on for decades because we are a user of both groundwater and surface water in arizona we are an active participant in the adjudication proceeding 

in re the general adjudication of all rights to use water in the gila river system and sources  maricopa county superior court cause nos w1 salt w2 verde w3 upper gila and w4 san pedro this case was originally initiated in 1974 with the filing of a petition with the arizona state land department and was consolidated and transferred to the maricopa county superior court in 1981 the principal parties in addition to us include the state of arizona the gila valley irrigation district the franklin irrigation district the san carlos irrigation and drainage district the salt river project the san carlos apache tribe the gila river indian community gric and the us on behalf of those tribes on its own behalf and on behalf of the white mountain apache tribe the fort mcdowell mohaveapache indian community the salt river pimamaricopa indian community and the payson community of yavapai apache indians 

prior to january 1 1983 various indian tribes filed suits in the us district court in arizona claiming superior rights to water being used by many other water users including us and claiming damages for prior use in derogation of their allegedly superior rights these federal proceedings have either been stayed pending the arizona superior court adjudications or have been settled 

the maricopa county superior court issued a decision in 2005 in the gila river adjudication that directed the arizona department of water resources adwr to prepare detailed recommendations regarding the delineation of the “subflow” zone of the san pedro river basin a tributary of the gila river according to the court the subflow zone is the subsurface area adjacent to the river where the court may find that groundwater is connected to the surface water such that groundwater pumping may reduce surface flows in violation of rights of holders of surface water rights although we have minimal interests in the san pedro river basin a decision that recharacterizes groundwater in that basin as surface water may set a precedent for other river systems in arizona that could have material implications for many commercial industrial municipal and agricultural users of groundwater including our arizona operations 

adwr produced its recommendations in june 2009 which were objected to by numerous parties following this and other court rulings in 2012 and 2013 adwr submitted a revised report in 2014 the court held hearings in 2015 to address the parties comments and objections and the issue is currently under advisement with the court also in 2014 adwr submitted a proposal for the next projects that it believes should be undertaken in the case including the development of procedures for cone of depression analyses to determine whether a well located outside of the subflow zone creates a cone of depression that intersects the subflow zone and causes a drawdown in the subflow of the river based on the cone of depression analyses wells outside of the subflow zone could be subject to the jurisdiction of the adjudication court which might then require the owners of those wells to either demonstrate a valid surface water claim to support the pumping refrain from pumping or pay damages on january 27 2017 adwr issued a report containing its recommendations on cone of depression methodologies and on january 31 2017 the special master issued an order initiating proceedings on the cone of depression test methodology developed by adwr parties have until march 6 2017 to file objections to the proposed methodology contained in adwr’s report a status conference has been set for march 15 2017 to schedule any proceedings necessary to resolve any objections filed to the adwr report 

as part of the gila river adjudication the us has asserted numerous claims for express and implied reserved surface water and groundwater rights on nonindian federal lands throughout arizona these claims are related to reservations of federal land for specific purposes  eg  national parks military bases and wilderness areas unlike 

 54 

state lawbased water rights federal reserved water rights are given priority in the prior appropriation system based on the date the land was reserved not the date that water was first used on the land in addition federal reserved water rights if recognized by the court may enjoy greater protection from groundwater pumping than is accorded to state lawbased water rights 

because federal reserved water rights have not yet been quantified the task of determining how much water each federal reservation may use has been left to the gila river adjudication court several “contested cases” to quantify reserved water rights for particular federal reservations in arizona are currently pending in the adjudication for instance in re aravaipa canyon wilderness area  is a contested case to resolve the uss claims to water for the aravaipa canyon wilderness area these claims went to trial in 2015 and the parties are awaiting a decision in re fort huachuca  concerns the uss claims to water for an army base trial began in october 2016 and has been continued into february 2017   in re redfield canyon wilderness area  and in re san pedro riparian national conservation area  concern the uss claims to two other federal reservations and these cases are expected to go to trial in 2017 

in multiple instances the us asserts a right to all water in a particular watershed that was not effectively appropriated under state law prior to the establishment of the federal reservation this creates risks for both surface water users and groundwater users because such expansive claims may severely impede current and future uses of water within the same watershed federal reserved rights present additional risks to water users aside from the significant quantities of water claimed by the us of particular significance federal reserved rights enjoy greater protection from groundwater pumping than is accorded to state lawbased water rights 

because there are numerous federal reservations in watersheds across arizona the reserved water right claims of the us pose a significant risk to multiple operations including morenci and safford in the upper gila river watershed and sierrita in the santa cruz watershed because federal reserved water rights may adversely affect water uses at each of these operations we have been actively involved in litigation over these claims 

given the legal and technical complexity of these adjudications their long history and their longterm legal economic and political implications it is difficult to predict the timing or the outcome of these proceedings if we are unable to satisfactorily resolve the issues being addressed in the adjudications our ability to pump groundwater could be diminished or curtailed and our operations at morenci safford and sierrita mines could be adversely affected unless we are able to acquire alternative resources

mining operations 

revised operating plans 

during 2015 in response to weak market conditions we took actions to enhance our financial position including significant reductions in capital spending production curtailments at certain north and south america mines which resulted in aggregate annual reductions of 350 million pounds of copper and 34 million pounds of molybdenum and actions to reduce operating exploration and administrative costs we continue to evaluate our mining operating plans and additional adjustments may be made as market conditions warrant 

revised operating plans for the north america copper mines incorporate reductions in mining rates to reduce operating and capital costs including the suspension of mining operations at the miami mine the suspension of production at the sierrita mine a 50 percent reduction in mining rates at the tyrone mine and adjustments to mining rates at other north america mines the revised plans at each of the operations also incorporated the impacts of lower energy acid and other consumables reduced labor costs and a significant reduction in capital spending plans 

the revised operating plan for our henderson molybdenum mine incorporates lower operating rates resulting in an approximate 65 percent reduction in annual production volumes we have also incorporated changes in the commercial pricing structure for our chemical products to promote continuation of chemicalgrade production 

revised operating plans for the south america mines principally reflect adjustments at el abra to reduce mining and stacking rates by approximately 50 percent to achieve lower operating and labor costs defer capital expenditures and extend the life of the existing operation

indonesia 

ownership  ptfi is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the republic of indonesia we directly own 8128 percent of the outstanding common stock of ptfi and indirectly own 936 percent through our wholly owned subsidiary pt indocopper investama the indonesian government owns the remaining 936 percent 

ptfi has established an unincorporated joint venture with rio tinto under which rio tinto has a 40 percent interest in certain assets and future production exceeding specified annual amounts of copper gold and silver through 2021 in block a of ptfis contract of work cow and after 2021 a 40 percent interest in all production from block a refer to note 3  for further discussion of the joint venture agreement 

contract of work  ptfi conducts its current exploration and mining operations in indonesia through a cow with the indonesian government the cow governs our rights and obligations relating to taxes exchange controls royalties repatriation and other matters and was concluded pursuant to the 1967 foreign capital investment law which expresses indonesia’s foreign investment policy and provides basic guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization a framework for economic incentives and basic rules regarding other rights and obligations of foreign investors specifically the cow provides that the indonesian government will not nationalize or expropriate ptfi’s mining operations any disputes regarding the provisions of the cow are subject to international arbitration however we have not had an arbitration during the more than 40 years we have operated in indonesia 

ptfi’s original cow was entered into in 1967 and was replaced by the current cow in 1991 the initial term of the current cow expires in 2021 but the cow explicitly provides that it can be extended for two 10year periods subject to indonesian government approval which pursuant to the cow cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably the cow allows us to conduct exploration mining and production activities in the 24700acre block a area which is where all of ptfi’s proven and probable mineral reserves and all its current mining operations are located under the cow ptfi also conducts exploration activities in the block b area currently covering 502000 acres ongoing negotiations for an amended cow discussed below and in note 13  may result in relinquishments of the block b acreage 

under the cow ptfi pays royalties on copper gold and silver in the concentrate it sells refer to note 13  for further discussion of the royalty rates and the regulatory matters discussion below regarding the modifications resulting from the july 2014 memorandum of understanding mou entered into with indonesian government a large part of the mineral royalties under indonesian government regulations is designated to the provinces from which the minerals are extracted in connection with its fourth concentrator mill expansion completed in 1998 ptfi agreed to pay the indonesian government additional royalties which were not required by the cow to provide further support to the local governments and to the people of the indonesian province of papua ptfi’s royalties totaled 114 million  in 2015  115 million  in 2014  and 109 million  in 2013  

 19 

regulatory matters  in january 2014 the indonesian government published regulations that among other things imposed a progressive export duty on copper concentrate and restricts concentrate exports after january 12 2017 despite ptfi’s rights under its cow to export concentrate without the payment of duties ptfi was unable to obtain administrative approval for exports and operated at approximately half of its capacity from midjanuary 2014 through july 2014 

in july 2014 ptfi entered into a mou with the indonesian government under the mou ptfi provided a 115 million assurance bond to support its commitment for smelter development agreed to increase royalty rates and agreed to pay export duties which were set at 75 percent declining to 50 percent when smelter development progress exceeds 75 percent and are eliminated when development progress exceeds 30 percent the mou also anticipated an amendment of the cow within six months to address other matters however no terms of the cow other than those relating to the smelter bond increased royalties and export duties were changed in january 2015 the mou was extended to july 25 2015 and it expired on that date the increased royalty rates export duties and smelter assurance bond remain in effect ptfi paid export duties totaling 109 million  in 2015  and 77 million  in 2014  

ptfi is required to apply for renewal of export permits at sixmonth intervals on july 29 2015 ptfis export permit was renewed through january 28 2016 in connection with the renewal export duties were reduced to 50 percent as a result of smelter development progress on february 9 2016 ptfis export permit was renewed through august 8 2016 ptfi will continue to pay a 50 percent export duty on concentrate while it reviews its smelter progress with the indonesian government 

ptfi continues to engage in discussions with the indonesian government regarding its cow and longterm operating rights in october 2015 the indonesian government provided a letter of assurance to ptfi indicating that it will approve the extension of ptfis operations beyond 2021 and provide the same rights and the same level of legal and fiscal certainty provided under its current cow 

in connection with its cow negotiations and subject to concluding the agreement to extend ptfis operations beyond 2021 on acceptable terms ptfi has agreed to construct new smelter capacity in indonesia and to divest an additional 2064 percent in ptfi at fair market value ptfi continues to advance plans for the smelter in parallel with completing its cow negotiations 

we cannot predict whether ptfi will be successful in reaching a satisfactory agreement on the terms of its longterm mining rights if ptfi is unable to reach agreement with the indonesian government on its longterm rights we may be required to reduce or defer investments in underground development projects which could have a material adverse effect on ptfi’s future production and reserves in addition ptfi would intend to pursue any and all claims against the indonesian government for breach of contract through international arbitration refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion of risks associated with operations in indonesia 

grasberg minerals district  ptfi operates in the remote highlands of the sudirman mountain range in the province of papua indonesia which is on the western half of the island of new guinea we and our predecessors have been the only operator of exploration and mining activities in block a since 1967 

the grasberg minerals district has three operating mines the grasberg open pit the deep ore zone doz underground mine and the deep mill level zone dmlz underground mine the grasberg minerals district also includes the developed big gossan underground mine where operations are currently suspended and are expected to restart in the first half of 2017 ptfi also has several projects in progress in the grasberg minerals district related to the development of the largescale longlived highgrade underground ore bodies located beneath and nearby the grasberg open pit in aggregate these underground ore bodies are expected to produce largescale quantities of copper and gold following the transition from the grasberg open pit currently anticipated to occur in late 2017 refer to mda for further discussion of these projects 

ptfi’s production including our joint venture partner’s share totaled 752 million  pounds of copper and 123 million  ounces of gold in 2015  651 million  pounds of copper and 113 million  ounces of gold in 2014  and 928 million  pounds of copper and 114 million  ounces of gold in 2013  

our principal source of power for all our indonesian operations is a coalfired power plant that we built in 1998 diesel generators supply peaking and backup electrical power generating capacity a combination of naturally occurring mountain streams and water derived from our underground operations provides water for our operations 

 20 

although we typically have sufficient water for our indonesian operations lower rainfall resulting from el niño weather conditions in the second half of 2015 has impacted operations and may continue to impact operations in 2016 our indonesian operations are in an active seismic zone and experience average annual rainfall of approximately 200 inches 

grasberg open pit 

ptfi began openpit mining of the grasberg ore body in 1990 mining operations are expected to continue through the end of 2017 and production from the ore stockpiles which are located outside of the pit limits are expected to continue until early 2019 production in the open pit is currently at the 3160 to 3715meter elevation level and totaled 42 million metric tons of ore in 2015  which provided 70 percent of ptfis 2015  mill feed 

the current openpit equipment fleet consists of over 500 units the larger mining equipment directly associated with production includes an available fleet of 141 haul trucks with payloads ranging from 218 to 276 metric tons and 16 shovels with bucket sizes ranging from 17 to 42 cubic meters which mined an average of 250400 metric tons of material per day in 2015  298400 metric tons per day in 2014  and 381000 metric tons per day in 2013  

crushing and conveying systems are integral to the grasberg mine and provide the capacity to transport more than 250000 metric tons of ore per day for the year 2015 grasbergs crushing and conveying systems delivered an average of 116000 metric tons of ore per day to the mill grasbergs overburden handling system is capable of delivering 175000 metric tons per day for the year 2015 the grasberg overburden handling system delivered an average of 43000 metric tons per day of overburden to the overburden stockpiles the remaining overburden moved by haul trucks averaged 72000 metric tons per day in 2015 ore milled from the grasberg open pit averaged 115900  metric tons of ore per day in 2015  69100 metric tons of ore per day in 2014 and 127700 metric tons of ore per day in 2013 

doz underground mine 

the doz ore body lies vertically below the now depleted intermediate ore zone ptfi began production from the doz ore body in 1989 using openstope mining methods but suspended production in 1991 in favor of production from the grasberg open pit production resumed in september 2000 using the blockcave method and is at the 3110meter elevation level 

the doz is a mature blockcave mine that previously operated at 80000 metric tons of ore per day current operating rates from the doz underground mine which range from 35000 to 65000 metric tons of ore per day are driven by the value of the incremental doz ore grade compared to the ore from the grasberg open pit and ore grade material from the development of the dmlz and grasberg block cave underground mines during 2015 ore milled from the doz underground mine averaged 43700  metric tons of ore per day production at the doz underground mine is expected to continue through 2021 

the doz mine fleet consists of over 250 pieces of mobile equipment the primary mining equipment directly associated with production and development includes an available fleet of 52 lhd units and 21 haul trucks each production lhd unit typically carries approximately 11 metric tons of ore using ore passes and chutes the lhd units transfer ore into 55metric ton capacity haul trucks the trucks dump into two gyratory crushers and the ore is then conveyed to the surface stockpiles for processing 

the success of the development of the doz mine one of the world’s largest underground mines provides confidence in the future development of ptfi’s largescale underground ore bodies 

dmlz underground mine 

the dmlz ore body lies below the doz underground mine at the 2590meter elevation and represents the downward continuation of mineralization in the ertsberg east skarn system and neighboring ertsberg porphyry ptfi began production from the dmlz ore body in september 2015 using the blockcave method ore milled from the dmlz underground mine averaged 2900  metric tons of ore per day for the year 2015  3500  metric tons per day in fourthquarter 2015 targeted production rates once the dmlz underground mine reaches full capacity are expected to approximate 80000 metric tons of ore per day in 2021 production at the dmlz underground mine is expected to continue through 2040 

the dmlz mine fleet consists of over 277 pieces of mobile equipment which includes 33 lhd units and 19 haul trucks used in production and development activities 

 21 

big gossan underground mine 

production from the big gossan ore body which is currently suspended is expected to restart in the first half of 2017 and ramp up to 7000 metric tons of ore per day in 2019 the big gossan mine lies underground and adjacent to the current mill site it is a tabular near vertical ore body with approximate dimensions of 1200 meters along strike and 800 meters down dip with varying thicknesses from 20 meters to 120 meters the mine utilizes a blasthole stoping method with delayed paste backfill stopes of varying sizes are mined and the ore dropped down passes to a truck haulage level trucks are chute loaded and transport the ore to a jaw crusher the crushed ore is then hoisted vertically via a twoskip production shaft to a level where it is loaded onto a conveyor belt the belt carries the ore to one of the main underground conveyors where the ore is transferred and conveyed to the surface stockpiles for processing 

the big gossan mine fleet consists of over 135 pieces of mobile equipment which includes five lhd units and three haul trucks used in development and production activities 

description of ore bodies   our indonesia ore bodies are located within and around two main igneous intrusions the grasberg monzodiorite and the ertsberg diorite the host rocks of these ore bodies include both carbonate and clastic rocks that form the ridge crests and upper flanks of the sudirman range and the igneous rocks of monzonitic to dioritic composition that intrude them the igneoushosted ore bodies the grasberg open pit and block cave and portions of the doz block cave occur as vein stockworks and disseminations of copper sulfides dominated by chalcopyrite and to a lesser extent bornite the sedimentaryrock hosted ore bodies portions of the doz and all of the big gossan occur as “magnetiterich calciummagnesian skarn” replacements whose location and orientation are strongly influenced by major faults and by the chemistry of the carbonate rocks along the margins of the intrusions 

the copper mineralization in these skarn deposits is dominated by chalcopyrite but higher bornite concentrations are common moreover gold occurs in significant concentrations in all of the district’s ore bodies though rarely visible to the naked eye these gold concentrations usually occur as inclusions within the copper sulfide minerals though in some deposits these concentrations can also be strongly associated with pyrite 

the following diagram indicates the relative elevations in meters of our reported indonesia ore bodies

during 2015  pt smelting treated 744800 metric tons of concentrate and produced 199700 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 198400 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery pt smelting resumed operations in september 2015 following a temporary suspension in july 2015 and operated at approximately 80 percent capacity until november 2015 when required repairs of an acid plant cooling tower that was damaged during the suspension were completed 

pt smeltings maintenance turnarounds which range from two weeks to a month to complete typically are expected to occur approximately every two years with shortterm maintenance turnarounds in the interim pt smelting completed a 23day maintenance turnaround during 2014 and the next major maintenance turnaround is scheduled for thirdquarter 2016 

miami smelter  we own and operate a smelter at our miami mining operation in arizona the smelter has been operating for approximately 100 years and has been upgraded numerous times during that period to implement new technologies to improve production and to comply with air quality requirements the miami smelter is installing emission control equipment that will allow it to operate in compliance with recently adopted enhanced air quality standards refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion 

the miami smelter processes copper concentrate primarily from our north america copper mines concentrate processed through the smelter totaled 686700 metric tons in 2015  in addition because sulphuric acid is a byproduct of smelting concentrate the miami smelter is also the most significant source of sulphuric acid for our north america leaching operations refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion 

major maintenance turnarounds which take approximately three weeks to complete typically occur approximately every 14 months for the miami smelter with shortterm maintenance turnarounds in the interim the miami smelter completed a major maintenance turnaround in thirdquarter 2015 and the next major maintenance turnaround is scheduled for fourthquarter 2016 

rod  refining operations  our rod  refining operations consist of conversion facilities located in north america including a refinery in el paso texas rod mills in el paso texas norwich connecticut and miami arizona and a specialty copper products facility in bayway new jersey we refine our copper anode production from our miami smelter at our el paso refinery the el paso refinery has the potential to operate at an annual production capacity of about 900 million pounds of copper cathode which is sufficient to refine all of the copper anode we produce at our miami smelter our el paso refinery also produces nickel carbonate copper telluride and autoclaved slimes material containing gold silver platinum and palladium 

molybdenum conversion facilities  we process molybdenum concentrate at our conversion plants in the us and europe into such products as technicalgrade molybdic oxide ferromolybdenum pure molybdic oxide ammonium molybdates and molybdenum disulfide we operate molybdenum roasters in sierrita arizona fort madison iowa and rotterdam the netherlands and we operate a molybdenum pressureleach plant in bagdad arizona we also produce ferromolybdenum for customers worldwide at our conversion plant located in stowmarket united kingdom 

freeport cobalt  in march 2013 we acquired a cobalt chemical refinery in kokkola finland and the related sales and marketing business the acquisition provided direct endmarket access for the cobalt hydroxide production at the tenke minerals district the joint venture operates under the name freeport cobalt and we are the operator with an effective 56 percent ownership interest the remaining effective ownership interest is held by our partners in tfm including 24 percent by lundin and 20 percent by gécamines the kokkola refinery has an annual refining capacity of approximately 15000 metric tons of cobalt sufficient to refine the majority of the cobalt we produce in the tenke minerals district 

other north america copper mines  we also have five nonoperating copper mines in north america – ajo bisbee twin buttes and tohono in arizona and cobre in new mexico – that have been on careandmaintenance status for 

 25 

several years and would require new or updated environmental studies new permits and additional capital investment which could be significant to return them to operating status 

mining development projects and exploration 

we have several projects and potential opportunities to expand production volumes extend mine lives and develop largescale underground ore bodies our nearterm major development projects include the underground development activities in grasberg refer to mda for further discussion considering the longterm nature and large size of our development projects actual costs and timing could vary from estimates we continue to review our mine development and processing plans to maximize the value of our mineral reserves 

capital expenditures for mining operations totaled 33 billion  including 24 billion  for major projects in 2015  40 billion  including 29 billion  for major projects in 2014  and 38 billion  including 23 billion  for major projects in 2013  capital expenditures for major projects during the three years ended december 31 2015 were primarily associated with the expansion projects at morenci and cerro verde and underground development activities at grasberg capital expenditures for major projects at mining operations in the year 2016 are expected to approximate 14 billion  and are primarily associated with underground development activities at grasberg and remaining costs for the cerro verde expansion 

ptfi is advancing plans for the construction of new smelter capacity in indonesia in parallel with completing negotiations on its cow and longterm operating rights ptfi has identified sites and project definition studies and early engineering are being advanced we are also engaged in discussions with potential partners for the project the preliminary scope of the facilities involves smelting and refining capacity of one to two million metric tons per year of copper concentrate from the grasberg mine 

we also have an additional longterm underground mine development project in the grasberg minerals district for the kucing liar ore body which lies on the southern flank of and underneath the southern portion of the grasberg open pit at the 2605meter elevation level we expect to mine the kucing liar ore body using the blockcave method aggregate capital cost estimates for development of the kucing liar ore body are projected to approximate 24 billion which are expected to be made between 2019 and 2031 additionally our current mine development plans include approximately 5 billion of capital expenditures at our processing facilities to optimize the handling of underground ore types once the grasberg openpit operations cease we expect substantially all of these expenditures to be m ade between 2018 and 2035   

our mining exploration activities are generally near our existing mines with a focus on opportunities to expand reserves and resources to support development of additional future production capacity in the large minerals districts where we currently operate exploration results continue to indicate opportunities for what we believe could be significant future potential reserve additions in north and south america and in the tenke minerals district the drilling data in north america also indicates the potential for significantly expanded sulfide production drilling results and exploration modeling provide a longterm pipeline for future growth in reserves and production capacity in established minerals districts exploration spending associated with mining operations totaled 102 million  in 2015 96 million in 2014 and 182 million in 2013 exploration spending continues to be reduced from historical levels as a result of market conditions and is expected to approximate 52 million  for the year 2016 

sources and availability of energy natural resources and raw materials 

our copper mining operations require significant energy principally diesel electricity coal and natural gas most of which is obtained from third parties under longterm contracts energy represented 17 percent  of our 2015  consolidated copper production costs and included purchases of approximately 250 million  gallons of diesel fuel 7600  gigawatt hours of electricity at our north america south america and africa copper mining operations we generate all of our power at our indonesia mining operation 800 thousand  metric tons of coal for our coal power plant in indonesia and 1  million british thermal units mmbtu of natural gas at certain of our north america mines based on current cost estimates we estimate energy will approximate 20 percent  of our consolidated copper production costs for 2016 

our mining operations also require significant quantities of water for mining ore processing and related support facilities the loss of water rights for any of our mines in whole or in part or shortages of water to which we have rights could require us to curtail or shut down mining operations for a further discussion of risks and legal proceedings associated with the availability of water refer to item 1a “risk factors” and item 3 “legal proceedings” 

 26 

sulphuric acid is used in the sxew process and is produced as a byproduct of the smelting process at our smelters and from our sulfur burners at the safford and tenke mines sulphuric acid needs in excess of the sulphuric acid produced by our operations are purchased from third parties as further discussed in item 1a risk factors if production were to be curtailed at the miami smelter we would be required to export concentrate rather than process it ourselves and to purchase sulphuric acid from third parties thereby increasing our operating costs 

community and human rights 

we have adopted policies that govern our working relationships with the communities where we operate and are designed to guide our practices and programs in a manner that respects human rights and the culture of the local people impacted by our operations we continue to make significant expenditures on community development education training and cultural programs which include 

 

in december 2000 we endorsed the joint us state departmentbritish foreign office voluntary principles on human rights and security voluntary principles we participated in developing these voluntary principles with other major natural resource companies and international human rights organizations and they are incorporated into our human rights policy 

we completed a corporate level human rights impact assessment in 2014 the results of which were used to evaluate our human rights program including a review of our human rights policy in february 2015 we updated our human rights policy to among other things reflect our commitment to integrating the united nations guiding principles on business and human rights into our human rights program we also participate in a multiindustry human rights working group to gain insight from peer companies and are integrating human rights due diligence into our business practices 

we believe that our social and economic development programs are responsive to the issues raised by the local communities near our areas of operation and should help us maintain good relations with the surrounding communities and avoid disruptions of mining operations as part of our ongoing annual commitment to sustainable community development we have made significant investments in social programs including inkind support and administration across our global operations over the last five years these investments have averaged 180 million per year nevertheless social and political instability in the areas of our operations may adversely impact our mining operations refer to item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

south america  cerro verde has provided a variety of community support projects over the years following engagements with regional and local governments civic leaders and development agencies in 2006 cerro verde committed to support the costs for a new potable water treatment plant to serve arequipa in addition an agreement was reached with the peruvian government for development of a water storage and distribution network which was financed by the cerro verde civil association the association the association manages contributions made by cerro verde for projects that focus on education training health cultural preservation and basic infrastructure 

cerro verde reached an agreement with the regional government of arequipa the national government sedapar and other local institutions to allow it to finance engineer and construct a wastewater treatment plant for the city of arequipa which is being used to supplement existing water supplies to support cerro verdes concentrator expansion treating this water will also improve the regional water quality enhance agriculture products grown in the area and reduce waterborne illnesses in addition to these projects cerro verde annually makes significant community development investments in the arequipa region 

indonesia  in 1996 ptfi established the freeport partnership fund for community development the partnership fund through which ptfi has made available funding and technical assistance to support community development initiatives in the areas of health education and economic development of the area ptfi has 

 27 

committed through 2016 to provide one percent of its annual revenue for the development of the local people in its area of operations through the partnership fund ptfi recognized 27 million  in 2015  31 million  in 2014  and 41 million  in 2013  for this commitment 

the amungme and kamoro community development organization  lembaga pengembangan masyarakat amungme dan kamoro  or lpmak oversees disbursement of the program funds we contribute to the partnership fund lpmak is governed by a board of commissioners and a board of directors which are comprised of representatives from the local amungme and kamoro tribal communities government leaders church leaders and one representative of ptfi on each board the amungme and kamoro people are original inhabitants of the land in our area of operations in addition to the partnership fund ptfi annually makes significant investments in public health education community infrastructure and economic development 

security matters    consistent with our cow in indonesia and our commitment to protect our employees and property we have taken steps to provide a safe and secure working environment as part of its security program ptfi maintains its own internal security department both employees and contractors are unarmed and perform functions such as protecting company facilities monitoring shipments of supplies and products assisting in traffic control and aiding in emergency response operations the security department receives human rights training annually 

ptfi’s share of costs for its internal civilian security department totaled 58 million for 2015  57 million for 2014  and 51 million for 2013  

ptfi and all businesses and residents of indonesia rely on the indonesian government for the maintenance of public order upholding the rule of law and the protection of personnel and property the grasberg minerals district has been designated by the indonesian government as one of indonesia’s vital national assets this designation results in the police and to a lesser extent the military playing a significant role in protecting the area of our operations the indonesian government is responsible for employing police and military personnel and directing their operations 

from the outset of ptfi’s operations the indonesian government has looked to ptfi to provide logistical and infrastructure support and assistance for these necessary services because of the limited resources of the indonesian government and the remote location of and lack of development in papua ptfi’s financial support for the indonesian government security institutions assigned to the operations area represents a prudent response to its requirements to protect its workforce and property better ensuring that personnel are properly fed and lodged and have the logistical resources to patrol ptfi’s roads and secure its operating area in addition the provision of such support is consistent with ptfi’s obligations under the cow reflects our philosophy of responsible corporate citizenship and is in keeping with our commitment to pursue practices that will promote human rights 

ptfi’s share of support costs for the governmentprovided security was 21 million in 2015  27 million in 2014  and 25 million in 2013  this supplemental support consists of various infrastructure and other costs such as food housing fuel travel vehicle repairs allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs and community assistance programs conducted by the military and police 

refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion of security risks in indonesia 

africa  tfm has committed to assist the communities living within its concession area in the southeast region of the drc initiatives include an integrated malaria control program construction renovation and building of local health facilities construction and renovation of local schools installation of over 115 clean water wells in rural villages as well as construction of urban water distribution systems and economic development programs supporting development and training of local entrepreneurs contractors and farmers we have also made significant investments in infrastructure in the region that will have lasting benefits to the country including upgrading a portion of a national road and the regional power generation and transmission systems 

through the armc tfm also contributes 03 percent of its net sales revenue to a community development fund to assist the local communities with development of local infrastructure and related services including health education and agriculture the tfm social community fund is managed by a board of directors comprised of two local community representatives one representative nominated by the provincial governor four tfm representatives and an observer representative from gecamines a stakeholder forum comprised of 40 community leaders provides for increased community participation and input regarding project priorities community needs and 

 28 

transparency of fund management the tfm social community fund contributions totaled 4 million  in each of the years in 2015  2014  and 2013  

security matters  tfm maintains an unarmed internal security department composed of both employees and contractors the national government also has assigned mines police to the tfm concession areas the mines police are a division of the congolese national police and are responsible for maintaining security in mining concessions throughout the drc tfm provides food housing medical services supervised transportation nonlethal equipment and monetary allowances as well as direct payments to the government for the provision of the security assigned to the concession areas the total cost to tfm for this support including inkind support approximated 1 million in 2015  2 million in 2014  and 1 million in 2013  

tfm also participates in monthly security coordination meetings with host country security personnel other mining companies nongovernmental organizations and representatives from the united nations to discuss security issues and concerns as an outcome of the coordination meetings tfm has partnered with monusco united nations stabilization mission in the drc to conduct human rights training in the tfm concessions for host government security personnel local representatives and tfm security employees

mineral reserves 

recoverable proven and probable reserves have been calculated in accordance with industry guide 7 as required by the securities exchange act of 1934 proven and probable reserves may not be comparable to similar information regarding mineral reserves disclosed in accordance with the guidance in other countries proven and probable reserves were determined by the use of mapping drilling sampling assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry as more fully discussed below the term “reserve” as used in the reserve data presented here means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination the term “proven reserves” means reserves for which i quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops trenches workings or drill holes ii grade andor quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and iii the sites for inspection sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established the term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced the degree of assurance although lower than that for proven reserves is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 

our mineral reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies we conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk we revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies 

estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves at december 31 2015  were determined using longterm average prices of 200  per pound for copper 1000  per ounce for gold and 10  per pound for molybdenum for the threeyear period ended december 31 2015  lme spot copper prices averaged 297  per pound london pm gold prices averaged 1276  per ounce and the weekly average price for molybdenum quoted by metals week  averaged 945  per pound 

the recoverable proven and probable reserves presented in the table below represent the estimated metal quantities from which we expect to be paid after application of estimated metallurgical recovery rates and smelter recovery rates where applicable recoverable reserves are that part of a mineral deposit that we estimate can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination

the reserve table above and the tables on the following pages utilize the abbreviations described below

 35 

in defining our openpit reserves we apply a “variable cutoff grade” strategy the objective of this strategy is to maximize the net present value of our operations we use a breakeven cutoff grade to define the insitu reserves for our underground ore bodies the breakeven cutoff grade is defined for a metric ton of ore as that equivalent copper grade once produced and sold that generates sufficient revenue to cover all operating and administrative costs associated with our production 

our copper mines may contain other commercially recoverable metals such as gold molybdenum silver and cobalt we value all commercially recoverable metals in terms of a copper equivalent percentage to determine a single cutoff grade copper equivalent percentage is used to express the relative value of multimetal ores in terms of one metal the calculation expresses the relative value of the ore using estimates of contained metal quantities metals prices as used for reserve determination recovery rates treatment charges and royalties our molybdenum properties use a molybdenum cutoff grade 

the table below shows the minimum cutoff grade by process for each of our existing ore bodies as of december 31 2015  



 36 

drill hole spacing data is used by mining professionals such as geologists and geological engineers in determining the suitability of data coverage on a relative basis in a given deposit type and mining method scenario so as to achieve a given level of confidence in the resource estimate drill hole spacing is only one of several criteria necessary to establish resource classification drilling programs are typically designed to achieve an optimum sample spacing to support the level of confidence in results that apply to a particular stage of development of a mineral deposit 

the following table sets forth the average drill hole spacing based on average sample distance or drill pattern spacing for proven and probable ore reserves by process type 



 37 

production sequencing 

the following chart illustrates our current plans for sequencing and producing our proven and probable reserves at each of our ore bodies and the years in which we currently expect production from each ore body and from related stockpiles the chart also shows the term of ptfis cow production volumes are typically lower in the first few years for each ore body as development activities are ongoing and as the mine ramps up to full production and production volumes may also be lower as the mine reaches the end of its life the sequencing dates shown in the chart below include development activity that results in metal production the ultimate timing of the start of production from our undeveloped mines is dependent upon a number of factors including the results of our exploration and development efforts and may vary from the dates shown below in addition we develop our mine plans based on maximizing the net present value from the ore bodies significant additional capital expenditures will be required at many of these mines in order to achieve the lifeofmine plans reflected below 

mill and leach stockpiles 

mill and leach stockpiles generally contain lower grade ores that have been extracted from an ore body and are available for copper recovery mill stockpiles contain sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through milling concentrating smelting and refining or alternatively by concentrate leaching leach stockpiles contain oxide ores and certain secondary sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities 

because it is generally impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count reasonable estimation methods are employed the quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grades of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles 

 38 

expected copper recovery rates for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing the recoverable copper in mill stockpiles once entered into the production process can be produced into copper concentrate almost immediately 

expected copper recovery rates for leach stockpiles are determined using smallscale laboratory tests small to largescale column testing which simulates the production process historical trends and other factors including mineralogy of the ore and rock type total copper recovery in leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low percentage to more than 90 percent depending on several variables including processing methodology processing variables mineralogy and particle size of the rock for newly placed material on active stockpiles as much as 80 percent of total copper recovery may be extracted during the first year and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years 

processes and recovery rates are monitored regularly and recovery rate estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes 

following are our stockpiles and the estimated recoverable copper contained within those stockpiles as of december 31 2015  

 

mineralized material 

we hold various properties containing mineralized material that we believe could be brought into production should market conditions warrant however permitting and significant capital expenditures would be required before operations could commence at these properties mineralized material is a mineralized body that has been delineated by appropriately spaced drilling andor underground sampling to support the reported tonnage and average metal grades such a deposit cannot qualify as recoverable proven and probable reserves until legal and economic feasibility are confirmed based upon a comprehensive evaluation of development costs unit costs grades recoveries and other material factors estimated mineralized materials as presented on the following page were assessed using prices of 220  per pound for copper 1000  per ounce for gold 12  per pound for molybdenum and 20 per ounce for silver

oil and gas operations 

through our wholly owned oil and gas subsidiary fm og our portfolio of oil and gas assets includes significant oil production facilities and growth potential in the deepwater gom established oil production onshore and offshore california large onshore natural gas resources in the haynesville shale in louisiana natural gas production from the madden area in central wyoming and a position in the inboard lower tertiarycretaceous natural gas trend onshore in south louisiana for the year 2015  88 percent  of our oil and gas revenues excluding the impact of derivative contracts were from sales of oil and ngls 

revised operating plans 

we are taking continuing actions to reduce oil and gas costs and capital expenditures fm og is undertaking a nearterm deferral of exploration and development expenditures by idling the three deepwater gom drillships it has under contract refer to mda for further discussion 

acreage 

at december 31 2015  we owned interests in oil and gas leases covering 44 million  gross acres  25 million  acres net to our interest developed acres are acres spaced or assigned to productive wells and do not include undrilled acreage held by production under the terms of the lease undeveloped acres are acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil or gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves the following table summarizes by geographic area the developed and undeveloped oil and gas acreage in which we held interests at december 31 2015  



as of december 31 2015 84 percent of our total net leasehold acreage is undeveloped many of our oil and gas leases require us to drill wells that are commercially productive and if we are unsuccessful we could lose our rights under such leases 

at december 31 2015 24 percent  of our total us net undeveloped acres was covered by leases that expire from 2016 through 2018 as a result of declining crude oil prices fm og’s current plans anticipate that the majority of expiring acreage will not be retained by drilling operations or other means 

currently fm og has a commitment to drill a second well in morocco in 2016 however fm og is actively negotiating with its partners to modify the work program which if successful would result in changes in the timing amount or type of future commitment the exploration permits covering fm ogs morocco acreage expire at the end of 2016  however fm og has the ability under certain circumstances to extend the exploration permits through 2019  

 41 

properties 

our oil and gas properties are subject to customary royalty interests liens incident to operating agreements liens for current taxes and other burdens including other mineral encumbrances and restrictions we do not believe that any of these burdens materially interfere with our use of the properties in the operation of our business 

we believe that we have satisfactory title to or rights in all of our producing properties as is customary in the oil and gas industry we conduct minimal investigation of title at the time we acquire undeveloped properties we conduct title investigations and receive title opinions of local counsel only before we commence drilling operations we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our other assets although title to our properties is subject to encumbrances in certain cases we believe that none of these burdens will materially detract from the value of our properties or from our interest therein or will materially interfere with our use in the operation of our business 

gulf of mexico  

deepwater gom fm og has a large strategic position in the deepwater gom with significant current oil production strong cash margins and existing infrastructure with excess production and handling capacity fm og’s deepwater gom properties and activities are principally located in four focus areas which we refer to as atwater valley green canyon mississippi canyon and keathley canyon

internal control and qualifications of third party engineers and internal staff  the technical personnel responsible for preparing the reserve estimates at nsai and ryder scott meet the requirements regarding qualifications independence objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers both nsai and ryder scott are independent firms of petroleum engineers geologists geophysicists and petrophysicists neither firm owns an interest in our properties nor are employed on a contingent fee basis fm ogs internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals work closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to nsai and ryder scott in their reserves estimation process throughout each fiscal year fm og internal technical staff meets with representatives of the independent reserve engineers to review properties and discuss methods and assumptions used in preparation of the proved reserves estimates fm og provides historical information to the independent reserve engineers including ownership interest oil and gas production well test data commodity prices and operating and development costs the nsai and ryder scott reserve reports are reviewed with representatives of nsai and ryder scott and fm ogs internal technical staff before dissemination of the information additionally fm ogs senior management reviews the nsai and ryder scott reserve reports 

the internal reservoir engineering staff are supervised by fm ogs vice president of engineering who has 39 years of technical experience in petroleum engineering and reservoir evaluation and analysis this individual directs the activities of our internal reservoir engineering staff for the internal reserve estimation process and also to provide the appropriate data to nsai and ryder scott for the yearend oil and gas reserves estimation process the preparation of proved oil and gas reserve estimates are completed in accordance with our internal control procedures these procedures which are intended to ensure reliability of reserve estimations include i the review and verification of historical production data ii the review by fmog’s vice president of engineering of annually reported proved reserves including the review of significant reserve changes and new proved undeveloped pud reserves additions iii the direct reporting responsibilities by fm og’s vice president of engineering to fm og’s president and chief operating officer iv the verification of property ownership by fm og’s land department and v no employee’s compensation is tied to the amount of reserves reported 

proved reserves our proved reserve volumes have been determined in accordance with sec guidelines which require the use of an average price calculated as the twelvemonth historical average of the firstdayofthemonth historical reference price as adjusted for location and quality differentials unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements excluding escalations based upon future conditions and the impact of derivatives our reference prices for reserve determination are the wti spot price for crude oil and the henry hub price for natural gas which were 5028  per barrel of oil and 259  per mmbtu of natural gas at december 31 2015  these prices are held constant throughout the life of the oil and gas properties except where such guidelines permit alternate treatment including the use of fixed and determinable contractual escalations in accordance with the guidelines and 

 45 

excluding the impact of derivative instruments the average realized prices used in our reserve reports as of december 31 2015  were 4780  per barrel of oil and 255  per mcf of natural gas 

  

the scope and results of procedures employed by nsai and ryder scott are summarized in their reserve reports for purposes of reserve estimation we and the independent petroleum engineers use technical and economic data including well logs geologic maps seismic data well test data production data historical price and cost information and property ownership interests our reserves have been estimated using deterministic methods standard engineering and geoscience methods were used or a combination of methods including performance analysis volumetric analysis and analogy which we and the independent petroleum engineers considered to be appropriate and necessary to categorize and estimate reserves in accordance with sec definitions and regulations a significant portion of these reserves are for undeveloped locations and are based on estimates of reserve volumes and recovery efficiencies along with analogy to properties with similar geologic and reservoir characteristics because these estimates depend on many assumptions any or all of which may differ substantially from actual results reserve estimates may differ from the quantities of oil and gas that fm og ultimately recovers 

proved reserves represent quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations the term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate 

the following table presents our estimated proved oil and gas reserves as of december 31 2015  all of which are located in the us 



a includes 9  mmbbls of ngl proved reserves consisting of 6  mmbbls of proved developed and 3  mmbbls of proved undeveloped 

at december 31 2015  we have an estimated total proved reserve life of 47 years and a proved developed reserve life of 32 years 

  

at december 31 2015  total proved oil and gas reserves were 252  mmboe including 83  mmboe of pud reserves with the exception of one planned sidetrack development well in one of our deepwater gom properties that cannot be executed until the current producing well depletes 98 percent of our pud reserves are scheduled for development within five years and 16 billion or 97 percent of our estimated future pud capital is associated with the development of those reserves 

total estimated pud reserves of 83 mmboe at december 31 2015  decreased from estimated pud reserves of 144 mmboe at december 31 2014  reflecting downward revisions of 72 mmboe primarily related to lower oil and gas price realizations these revisions were partly offset by increases of 11 mmboe primarily associated with the continued development of our deepwater gom properties 

at december 31 2014 fm og had 1176 pud locations including 132 injector wells of which 122 pud locations with associated proved reserves of 28 mmboe were scheduled to be drilled during 2015 during 2015 fm og invested 06 billion to drill and complete 35 pud locations which resulted in converting 1 mmboe from pud reserves to proved developed reserves of the remaining 87 pud locations scheduled to be drilled in 2015 81 locations with associated proved reserves of 3 mmboe were eliminated based on the current price environment 

 46 

4 locations with associated proved reserves of 17 mmboe were drilled and are expected to be completed in 2016 and 2017 and 2 locations with associated proved reserves of 7 mmboe were delayed to future periods 

at december 31 2015 fm og had 186 pud locations including 4 injector wells during 2016 33 of these pud locations including 2 injector wells with associated proved reserves of 35 mmboe are scheduled to be developed 

during 2015  fm og participated in 37  gross exploratory wells of which 33 were successful and 26  gross development wells of which 24 were successful refer to drilling activities 

the following table reflects the present value of estimated future net cash flows before income taxes from the production and sale of our estimated proved reserves reconciled to the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows standardized measure at december 31 2015  in millions 



a in accordance with sec guidelines estimates of future net cash flows from our proved reserves and the present value thereof are made using the twelvemonth average of the firstdayofthemonth historical reference prices as adjusted for location and quality differentials refer to discussion above for pricing used in our reserve reports at december 31 2015 

b the present value of estimated future net cash flows before income taxes pv10 is not considered a us generally accepted accounting principle gaap financial measure we believe that our pv10 presentation is an important measure and useful to our investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves before taking into account the related future income taxes as such taxes may differ among companies because of differences in the amounts and timing of deductible basis net operating loss carryforwards and other factors we believe investors use our pv10 as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our proved reserves to the reserve estimates of other companies pv10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under us gaap and is not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and gas reserves pv10 should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under us gaap 

c future tax deductions are expected to be sufficient to fully offset future taxable income resulting in no future income tax obligation at december 31 2015  

refer to note 21  for further discussion of our proved reserves 

probable reserves all of our probable oil and gas reserves at december 31 2015  are based upon reserve reports prepared by the independent petroleum engineering firm of nsai probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which together with proved reserves are as likely as not to be recovered in addition to the uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of proved reserves probable reserves may be assigned to areas where data control or interpretations of available data are less certain even if the interpreted reservoir continuity of structure or productivity does not meet the reasonably certain criterion probable reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir probable reserve estimates also include potential incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than assumed for proved reserves undeveloped reserves that meet the reasonably certain economic and other requirements to be classified as proved undeveloped except that they are not expected to be developed within five years are classified as probable reserves 

 47 

the following table presents our estimated probable oil and gas reserves at december 31 2015  



a includes 5  mmbbls of ngl probable reserves consisting of 2  mmbbls of probable developed and 3  mmbbls of probable undeveloped 

b reflects reserves associated with incremental recovery from existing productioninjection wells that require minimal to no future development costs and reserves associated with work performed on existing producersinjectors that do not meet the reasonable certainty requirements to be classified as proved reserves 

drilling activities 

the following table provides the total number of wells that we drilled during the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  and the sevenmonth period ending december 31 2013  



in addition to the wells drilled there were 9 gross exploratory and 19 gross development wells 5 net exploratory and 7 net development wells in progress at december 31 2015  

productive wells 

we had working interests in 3060 gross 2976 net active producing oil wells and 1759 gross 213 net active producing natural gas wells at december 31 2015  3069 gross 2991 net active producing oil wells and 1710 gross 211 net active producing natural gas wells at december 31 2014  and 3310 gross 3153 net active producing oil wells and 1651 gross 238 net active producing natural gas wells at december 31 2013  one or more completions in the same well bore are considered one well if any well in which one of the multiple completions is an oil completion such well is classified as an oil well at december 31 2015  we owned interests in five gross wells containing multiple completions

we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements we caution readers that forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated projected or assumed in the forwardlooking statements important factors that can cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements include the following 

financial risks 

declines in the market prices of copper gold and oil have adversely affected our earnings cash flows and asset values and if sustained or intensified may adversely affect our ability to repay debt fluctuations in the market prices of copper gold and oil have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in our financial performance and in the trading prices of our debt and common stock 

our financial results vary with fluctuations in the market prices of the commodities we produce primarily copper gold and oil and to a lesser extent molybdenum silver cobalt and natural gas as described below during 2015 and in early 2016 copper and oil prices declined significantly if low prices persist or decline further they may continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial results the value of our assets andor our ability to repay our debt and meet our other fixed obligations and may continue to depress the trading prices of our common stock and of our publicly traded debt securities 

in response to lower commodities prices we have announced revised operating plans that incorporate significant reductions in capital spending production curtailments at certain north and south america mines and actions to reduce operating exploration and administrative costs which may not achieve all the results we anticipate if market prices for our primary commodities continue to decline or persist at low levels we may have to further revise our operating plans including curtailing production further reducing operating costs and capital expenditures and discontinuing certain exploration and development programs we may be unable to decrease our costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues in which case we may incur additional losses and those losses may be material we are also pursuing asset sales and joint venture arrangements to raise proceeds for debt reduction we may be unable to receive favorable terms for asset sales or joint venture arrangements in the current market environment which may prevent us from achieving our desired debt reduction levels 

fluctuations in commodities prices are caused by varied and complex factors beyond our control including global supply and demand balances and inventory levels global economic and political conditions international regulatory trade and tax policies commodities investment activity and speculation the price and availability of substitute products and changes in technology 

in particular copper prices may be affected by demand from china which has become the largest consumer of refined copper in the world and by changes in demand for industrial commercial and residential products containing copper copper prices have declined significantly during 2015 with london metal exchange lme spot copper prices averaging 311 per pound in 2014 and 249  per pound in 2015 on december 31 2015  the lme spot copper price was 213  per pound copper prices weakened further in early 2016 with the lme spot copper price ranging from 196 per pound to 213 per pound from january 1 2016 to february 19 2016  the decline in prices during 2015 resulted in noncash charges for copper and molybdenum inventory adjustments  338 million  and longlived mining asset impairments  37 million  as more fully discussed in notes 4 and 5 copper prices at or below the december 31 2015  level could result in additional inventory adjustments and impairment charges for our longlived mining assets other events that could result in impairment of our longlived mining assets include but are not limited to decreases in estimated proven and probable mineral reserves and any event that might otherwise have a material adverse effect on mine production costs 

 49 

factors affecting gold prices may include the relative strength of the us dollar to other currencies inflation and interest rate expectations purchases and sales of gold by governments and central banks demand from china and india two of the world ’ s largest consumers of gold and global demand for jewelry containing gold the london pm gold price averaged 1160  per ounce in 2015 and 1266 per ounce in 2014 and was 1062  per ounce on december 31 2015 

crude oil prices have been and could be affected in the future by continued development of shale reserves through hydraulic fracturing actions of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and other major oil producing nations political and weather conditions in oil producing regions transportation and refinery capacity the amount of foreign imports of oil into the us and the impact of legislation adopted in december 2015 lifting 40year old restrictions on exporting us oil oil prices have declined significantly since mid2014 with brent crude oil prices averaging 9945  per barrel in 2014 and 5364  per barrel in 2015 on december 31 2015   the brent crude oil price was 3728  in early 2016 oil prices weakened further to multiyear lows in response to excess global supplies and relatively weak economic conditions with brent crude oil prices ranging from 2788 per barrel to 3722 per barrel from january 1 2016 to february 19 2016  as further discussed in note 1 and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda lower oil prices and to a lesser extent natural gas prices were a significant contributing factor to the noncash impairment charges totaling 131 billion  for the year 2015 and 37 billion  for the year 2014 to writedown the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties 

as further described in note 1 under full cost accounting rules a ceiling test is conducted each quarter to review the carrying value of proved oil and gas properties for impairment the us securities and exchange commission sec requires that the twelvemonth average of the firstdayofthemonth historical reference prices be used to determine the ceiling test limitation using west texas intermediate wti as the reference oil price the average price was 5028  per barrel at december 31 2015  compared with 9499  per barrel at december 31 2014 if the twelvemonth historical average price remains below the december 31 2015  twelvemonth average of 5028  per barrel the ceiling test limitation will decrease potentially resulting in additional ceiling test impairments of our oil and gas properties the wti spot oil price was 2964  per barrel at february 19 2016  

in addition to declines in the trailing twelvemonth average oil and natural gas prices other factors that could result in future impairment of our oil and gas properties include costs transferred from unevaluated properties to the full cost pool without corresponding proved oil and natural gas reserve additions negative reserve revisions and the future incurrence of exploration development and production costs at december 31 2015 carrying costs for unevaluated properties were 48 billion  these costs will be transferred into the full cost pool as the properties are evaluated and proved reserves are established or if impairment is determined if these activities do not result in additions to discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves at least equal to the related costs transferred net of related tax effects ceiling test impairments may occur during 2015 we transferred 64 billion  of costs associated with unevaluated properties to the full cost pool mostly reflecting impairment of the carrying values of unevaluated properties 

our debt and other financial commitments may limit our financial and operating flexibility 

at december 31 2015  our total consolidated debt was  204 billion  see note 8 and our total consolidated cash was 224 million  we also have various other financial commitments including for reclamation and environmental obligations takeorpay contracts and leases our level of indebtedness and other financial commitments could have important consequences to our business including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 50 

on february 26 2016 we reached agreement with our bank group to amend our revolving credit facility and term loan the changes pursuant to the revolving credit facility and the term loan included modifications of the maximum leverage ratio and minimum interest expense coverage ratio to provide us with additional flexibility and the commitment under our revolving credit facility has been reduced by 500 million from 40 billion to 35 billion a springing collateral and guarantee trigger was added to the revolving credit facility and term loan under this provision if we have not entered into definitive agreements for asset sales totaling 30 billion in aggregate by june 30 2016 that are reasonably expected to close by december 31 2016 we will be required to secure the revolving credit facility and term loan with a mutually acceptable collateral and guarantee package if such asset sales totaling 30 billion in aggregate have not occurred by december 31 2016 then the springing collateral and guarantee trigger will go into effect refer to notes 8 and 18 for further information about the revolving credit facility and term loan 

any failure to comply with the financial and other covenants in our debt agreements may result in an event of default that would allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt which in turn may trigger crossacceleration or crossdefault provisions in other debt agreements our cash flow would not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our debt instruments that are accelerated upon an event of default 

since august 2015 and through january 5 2016 we sold 210 million  shares of our common stock at an average price of 947 per share under atthemarket equity programs that generated approximately 2 billion  in gross proceeds we may seek to raise additional equity capital to fund operations reduce debt or improve our financial position which may have a negative impact to our stock price for additional information see note 10 

as of february 24 2016 our senior unsecured debt was rated bb with a negative outlook by standard  poor’s sp bbb with a negative outlook by fitch ratings fitch and b1 with a negative outlook by moody’s investors service moodys there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not be downgraded in the future for more information refer to the risk factor below relating to mine closure and reclamation regulations and plugging and abandonment obligations related to our oil and gas operations 

our strategic review of the oil and gas business and evaluation of other transactions may not result in increased stockholder value 

our board of directors the board is undertaking a strategic review of alternatives for our oil and gas business we and our advisors are actively engaged with interested parties in a process to evaluate opportunities that include asset sales and joint venture arrangements that would generate cash proceeds for debt repayment we are also evaluating transactions involving certain of our mining assets these initiatives may not result in transactions or other events that will lead to debt reduction or an increase in stockholder value 

mine closure and reclamation regulations impose substantial costs on our operations and include requirements that we provide financial assurance supporting those obligations we also have plugging and abandonment obligations related to our oil and gas properties and are required to provide bonds or other forms of financial assurance in connection with those operations   changes in or the failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us 

we are required by us federal and state laws and regulations to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans for our mining properties if we are unable to do so the us environmental protection agency epa and state agencies may also require financial assurance for investigation and remediation actions that are required under settlements of enforcement actions under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 cercla or equivalent state regulations refer to note 12 for additional information regarding our financial assurance obligations 

with respect to our mining operations most of our financial assurance obligations are imposed by state laws that vary significantly by jurisdiction currently there are no financial assurance requirements for active mining operations under cercla but in august 2014 several environmental organizations initiated litigation against the epa to require it to set a schedule for adopting financial assurance regulations under cercla governing the hard rock mining industry the epa and the environmental organizations reached a joint agreement and submitted it to the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit for approval notwithstanding industry objections the court approved the agreement on january 29 2016 thereby requiring the epa to propose financial assurance 

 51 

regulations for the hard rock mining industry by december 1 2016 and to provide notice of its final action by december 1 2017 the court also ruled that the epa has no obligation to promulgate rules at all and has until the end of 2016 to decide whether or not to proceed it is uncertain how the new requirements if promulgated will affect the amount and form of our existing and future financial assurance obligations or the extent to which they will supplement or replace state requirements any new regulations may however be financially material and adverse 

we are also subject to financial assurance requirements in connection with our oil and gas operations under both state and federal laws for example permits bonding and insurance are required to drill operate and plug and abandon wells financial responsibility requirements are also required under the oil pollution act of 1990 to cover containment and cleanup costs resulting from an oil spill 

in order to cover the various obligations of lessees operating in federal waters such as the cost to plug and abandon wells and decommission and remove platforms and pipelines at the end of production the boem generally requires that lessees demonstrate financial strength and reliability according to regulatory standards sufficient to obtain a waiver from the requirement to post supplemental bonds or post such bonds or other acceptable assurances that those obligations will be satisfied although we are currently exempt from the requirement to post security under the current rules we may be required to post security under these rules if the boem determines we are no longer eligible for the exemption which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity in august 2014 the boem issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking in which the agency indicated that it was considering changing the financial assurance requirements and it currently plans to publish a revised notice in 2016 among other things the notice states that the boem intends to revise its supplemental bonding procedures to eliminate waivers from the requirement to post security substantial changes to boem’s financial assurance requirements including a requirement to post significant amounts of security in the form of bonds or similar assurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity the cost for bonds or assurances can be substantial and there is no assurance that they can be obtained in all cases our failure to provide financial assurance or failure to do the same by our colessees could result in boem or the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement bsee suspending or terminating operations on affected leases which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2015  our financial assurance obligations associated with closure reclamation and remediation of mining sites and plugging and abandonment obligations in our oil and gas operations totaled approximately 26 billion and a substantial portion of these obligations were satisfied by fcx and fm og guarantees and financial capability demonstrations as a result of the downgrade of the credit ratings of our debt below investment grade by sps and moody’s we may be required to provide additional or alternative forms of financial assurance such as letters of credit surety bonds or collateral these other forms of assurance would be costly to provide and depending on our financial condition and market conditions may be difficult or impossible to obtain failure to provide the required financial assurance could result in the closure of the affected mines or suspension of the affected oil and gas operations 

refer to notes 1 and 12  for further discussion of our environmental and asset retirement obligations 

international risks 

our international operations are subject to political social and geographic risks of doing business in countries outside the us 

we are a usbased natural resources company with substantial mining assets located outside of the us we conduct international mining operations in indonesia peru chile and the democratic republic of congo drc accordingly in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in countries outside the us our business may be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties in each of these countries risks of conducting business in countries outside of the us include 

 

 

 

 52 

because of rising resource nationalism in countries around the world may impose increasingly onerous requirements on foreign operations and investment 

 

 

 

 

our insurance does not cover most losses caused by the above described risks accordingly our exploration development and production activities outside of the us may be substantially affected by many unpredictable factors beyond our control some of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our international operations must comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption and antibribery laws of the other jurisdictions in which we operate there has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of these laws in recent years and a steadily increasing focus on enforcement of those laws continues any violation of those laws could result in significant criminal or civil fines and penalties litigation and loss of operating licenses or permits and may damage our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are involved in several significant tax proceedings and other tax disputes with the indonesian and peruvian tax authorities refer to note 12  for further discussion of these matters other risks specific to certain countries in which we operate are discussed in more detail below 

because our grasberg mining operations in indonesia is a significant operating asset our business may continue to be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties and security risks in indonesia 

our mining operations in indonesia are conducted by our subsidiary pt freeport indonesia ptfi pursuant to a contract of work cow with the indonesian government maintaining a good working relationship with the indonesian government is important to us because of the significance of our indonesia operations to our business and because our mining operations there are among indonesias most significant business enterprises partially because of their significance to indonesias economy the environmentally sensitive area in which they are located and the number of people employed our indonesia operations have been the subject of political debates and of criticism in the indonesian press and have been the target of protests and occasional violence for further discussion of the history of ptfis cow refer to note 13  

the initial term of ptfis cow expires in 2021 but the cow explicitly provides that it can be extended for two 10year periods subject to indonesian government approval which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably ptfi has been engaged in discussions with officials of the indonesian government since 2012 regarding various provisions of its cow including extending the term of the cow notwithstanding provisions in the cow prohibiting it from doing so the indonesian government has sought to modify existing mining contracts including ptfi’s cow to address provisions contained in the mining law enacted in 2009 and mining regulations adopted thereunder including matters with respect to the size of contract concessions government revenues domestic processing of minerals divestment provision of local goods and services conversion from a cow to a licensing framework for extension periods and a requirement that extensions may be applied for only within two years prior to a cow’s expiration 

  

regulations published in january 2014 imposed among other things a progressive export duty on copper concentrate and restricts concentrate exports after january 12 2017 despite ptfi’s rights under its cow to 

 53 

export concentrate without the payment of duties ptfi was unable to obtain administrative approval for exports and operated at approximately half of its capacity from midjanuary 2014 through july 2014 

in july 2014 ptfi entered into a memorandum of understanding mou with the indonesian government under the mou ptfi provided a 115 million assurance bond to support its commitment for smelter development agreed to increase royalty rates and agreed to pay export duties which were set at 75 percent declining to 50 percent when smelter development progress exceeds 75 percent and are eliminated when development progress exceeds 30 percent the mou also anticipated an amendment of the cow within six months to address other matters however no terms of the cow other than those relating to the smelter bond increased royalties and export duties were changed in january 2015 the mou was extended to july 25 2015 and it expired on that date the increased royalty rates export duties and smelter assurance bond remain in effect 

ptfi is required to apply for renewal of export permits at sixmonth intervals on july 29 2015 ptfis export permit was renewed through january 28 2016 in connection with the renewal export duties were reduced to 50 percent as a result of smelter development progress on february 9 2016 ptfis export permit was renewed through august 8 2016 ptfi will continue to pay a 50 percent export duty on concentrate while it reviews its smelter progress with the indonesian government 

as of december 31 2015 we owned 9064 percent of ptfi and the remaining 936 percent was owned by the indonesian government upon completion of an amended cow which has not yet occurred we and ptfi have agreed to divest to the indonesian national or local governments andor indonesian nationals up to a 30 percent interest an additional 2064 percent in ptfi at fair market value 

ptfi is engaged in active discussions with the indonesian government regarding an amended cow the revisions to the cow are expected to result in additional costs for our indonesian operations we cannot predict whether we will be successful in reaching a satisfactory agreement on the terms of our longterm mining rights it has been difficult to get firm or final commitments from the indonesian government as a result the outcome of these discussions remains uncertain if we are unable to reach agreement with the government on our longterm rights we may be required to reduce or defer investments in our underground development projects which would materially and adversely affect future production and reserves in addition we cannot predict whether our applications for renewal of export permits which are required at sixmonth intervals will be granted on a timely basis or whether we will be permitted to export concentrate after august 8 2016 recent media reports have indicated that the indonesia government is considering revisions to the 2009 mining law it is unclear how any such changes would impact our current negotiations with the indonesian government related to the extension and amendment of the cow smelter development export permits and other significant issues 

indonesia has long faced separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces several separatist groups have sought increased political independence for the province of papua where our grasberg minerals district is located in papua there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the indonesian military in addition illegal miners have periodically clashed with police who have attempted for years to move them away from our facilities social economic and political instability in papua could materially and adversely affect us if it results in damage to our property or interruption of our indonesia operations 

in 2009 a series of shooting incidents occurred within the ptfi project area including along the road leading to our mining and milling operations the shooting incidents have continued on a sporadic basis with the last incident occurring on january 1 2015 during this time there were 20 fatalities and 59 injuries to our employees contractor employees government security personnel and civilians to date no one person or group has claimed responsibility for the shootings the safety of our workforce is a critical concern and ptfi continues to work with the indonesian government to address security issues the investigation of these incidents is ongoing we also continue to limit the use of the road leading to our mining and milling operations to secured convoys 

we cannot predict whether additional incidents will occur that could disrupt or suspend our indonesian operations if other disruptive incidents occur they could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in ways that we cannot predict at this time for further discussion of labor disruptions at ptfi refer to the operational risk factor labor unrest and activism could disrupt our operations and may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects

we will not mine all of our ore reserves in indonesia before the initial term of our cow expires 

the initial term of ptfis cow expires in 2021 but can be extended for two 10year periods subject to indonesian government approval which pursuant to the cow cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably our proven and probable ore reserves in indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041 and our current mine plan and planned operations are based on the assumption that we will receive the two 10year extensions as a result we will not mine all of these ore reserves during the initial term of the current cow prior to the end of 2021 we expect to mine 21 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable ore at december 31 2015  representing 27 percent of ptfis share of recoverable copper reserves and 38 percent of its share of recoverable gold reserves there can be no assurance that the indonesian government will approve our cow extensions for further discussion refer to the above risk factor because our grasberg minerals district is a significant operating asset our business may continue to be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties and security risks in indonesia 

ptfis cow may be subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations and if a dispute arises we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of an international arbitration panel 

ptfis cow was entered into under indonesias 1967 foreign capital investment law which provides guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization the cow may be subject to termination by the indonesian government if we do not satisfy our contractual obligations which include the payment of royalties and taxes to the government and the satisfaction of certain mining environmental safety and health requirements 

recently adopted indonesian laws and regulations conflict with the mining rights established under the cow although the cow grants to ptfi the unencumbered right to operate in accordance with the cow government agencies have sought and may continue to seek to impose additional restrictions on ptfi that could affect exploration and operating requirements for further discussion refer to the above risk factor because our grasberg minerals district is a significant operating asset our business may continue to be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties and security risks in indonesia 

at times certain government officials and others in indonesia have questioned the validity of contracts entered into by the indonesian government prior to may 1998  ie  during the suharto regime which lasted over 30   years including ptfis cow which was signed in december 1991 we cannot provide assurance that the validity of or our compliance with the cow will not be challenged for political or other reasons 

ptfis cow requires that disputes with the indonesian government be submitted to international arbitration accordingly if a dispute arises under the cow we face the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of an international arbitration panel and if we prevail in such a dispute we will face the additional risk of having to enforce the judgment of an international arbitration panel against indonesia within its own territory additionally our operations may be materially and adversely affected while resolution of a dispute is pending and such a dispute could be pending for years 

the tenke fungurume tenke minerals district is located in the southeast region of the drc and may be adversely affected by security risks and political economic and social instability in the drc 

since gaining independence in 1960 the drc has undergone outbreaks of violence changes in national leadership and financial crises the drc held its first democratic elections in 2006 president joseph kabila elected in 2006 and currently serving his second fiveyear term is not eligible under the drc constitution for reelection the next presidential election is scheduled to be held in november 2016 but recent reports indicate that the government may delay the elections which could lead to additional unrest these factors heighten the risk of abrupt changes in the national policy toward foreign investors which in turn could result in unilateral modification of concessions or contracts increased taxation denial of permits or permit renewals or expropriation of assets as part of a review of all mining contracts by the ministry of mines the ministry in the drc in february 2008 we received notification that the ministry wished to renegotiate several material provisions of tenke fungurume mining sas tfm mining contracts in october 2010 the drc government concluded its review of tfms existing mining contracts and confirmed that they were in good standing in connection with the review several amendments were made to tfm ’ s mining contracts and governing documents and in march 2012 fcxs effective ownership in tfm was reduced from 5775 percent to 56 percent 

 55 

political economic social and security risks in the drc are generally outside of our control and could adversely affect our business these risks include legal and regulatory uncertainties with limited effective recourse through the courts exposure to an environment of governmental corruption and bribery unwarranted attempts to increase taxes or make claims for fees and penalties by governmental officials including retroactive claims administrative disputes security risks resulting from political instability risks associated with illegal mining activity on tenkes concession and risk of loss because of civil strife acts of war guerrilla activities insurrection and terrorism 

in addition to ongoing conflict in the eastern region of the drc there have been acts of violence in the southeast region of the drc where the tenke minerals district is located the safety of our workforce at all of our operations is our highest priority and tfm works cooperatively with government officials to address security issues however no assurance can be given that conflict or random acts of violence will not occur near or impact tenkes operations 

accordingly our tenke operations and future development activities at the tenke minerals district may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control any of which could interrupt tfm ’ s operations or future development activities and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

operational risks 

our mining and oil and gas operations are subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our business 

our mines are very large in scale and by their nature are subject to significant operational risks some of which are outside of our control and many of which are not covered fully or in some cases even partially by insurance these operational risks which could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and cash flow include earthquakes rainstorms floods and other natural disasters equipment failures accidents wall failures and rock slides in our openpit mines and structural collapses of our underground mines or tailings impoundments and lower than expected ore grades or recovery rates 

the waste rock including overburden and tailings produced in our mining operations represent our largest volume of waste managing the volume of waste rock and tailings presents significant environmental safety and engineering challenges and risks we maintain large leach pads and tailings impoundments containing viscous material which are effectively large dams that must be engineered constructed and monitored to assure structural stability and avoid leakages or structural collapse our tailings impoundments in arid areas must have effective programs to suppress fugitive dust emissions and we must effectively monitor and treat acid rock drainage at all of our operations in indonesia we use a river transport system for tailings management which presents other risks as discussed elsewhere in these risk factors 

the failure of tailings and other impoundments at any of our mining operations could cause severe property and environmental damage and loss of life and we apply significant financial resources and both internal and external technical resources to the effective safe management of all those facilities the importance of careful design management and monitoring of large impoundments was emphasized recently by large scale tailings dam failures at unaffiliated mines which caused extensive property and environmental damage and resulted in the loss of life 

our oil and gas operations are also subject to operating hazards including well blowouts cratering explosions fires uncontrollable flows of oil gas or well fluids and pipeline ruptures as well as natural disasters such as earthquakes mudslides and hurricanes our operations in california including transportation of oil by pipelines within the city and county of los angeles are especially susceptible to damage from earthquakes and involve increased risks of personal injury property damage and marketing interruptions because of the population density of southern california our operations in the gulf of mexico gom and gulf coast region are particularly susceptible to interruption and damage from hurricanes any of these operating hazards could cause personal injuries fatalities oil spills discharge of hazardous substances into the air soil water and groundwater and other property or environmental damage lost production and revenue remediation and cleanup costs and liability for damages all of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and may not be fully covered by our insurance 

 56 

labor unrest and activism could disrupt our operations and may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

as of december 31 2015  48 percent  of our global labor force was covered by collective bargaining agreements and 4 percent  of our global labor force was covered by agreements that expired in 2015 and are currently being negotiated or will expire during 2016 including the agreement covering employees at our el abra mine in chile none of the employees of our oil and gas operations are represented by a union or covered by a collective labor agreement labor agreements are negotiated on a periodic basis and may not be renewed on reasonably satisfactory terms to us or at all if we do not successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements with our union workers we may incur prolonged strikes and other work stoppages at our mining operations which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations additionally if we enter into a new labor agreement with any union that significantly increases our labor costs relative to our competitors our ability to compete may be materially and adversely affected refer to items 1 and 2 business and properties for additional information regarding labor matters and expiration dates of such agreements 

we could also experience labor disruptions such as work stoppages work slowdowns union organizing campaigns strikes or lockouts which could adversely affect our operations for example our ptfi operations were affected by work stoppages in 2011 and during firstquarter 2012 in october 2014 a large percentage of grasberg openpit operators did not report to their scheduled shifts notwithstanding approval of resumption of operations by indonesian authorities upon completion of their investigation of a fatal haul truck accident that occurred near the grasberg open pit significant reductions in productivity or protracted work stoppages at one or more of our operations could significantly reduce our production and sales volumes which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our mining operations depend on the availability of secure water supplies 

our mining operations require physical availability and secure legal rights to significant quantities of water for mining and ore processing activities and related support facilities most of our north and south america mining operations are in areas where competition for water supplies is significant continuous production at our mines is dependent on many factors including our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies 

in arizona where our operations use both surface and ground water we are a participant in two active general stream adjudications in which the arizona courts have been attempting for over 40 years to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for two of the states largest river systems which primarily affect our morenci safford sierrita and miami mines the adjudications are addressing the state law claims of thousands of competing users including us as well as significant federal water claims that are potentially adverse to the state law claims of both surface water and groundwater users groundwater is treated differently from surface water under arizona law which historically allowed land owners to pump unlimited quantities of subsurface water subject only to the requirement of putting it to reasonable use however court decisions in one of the adjudications have concluded that underground water is often hydrologically connected to surface water so that it actually is surface water and is therefore subject to the arizona doctrine of prior appropriation as a result of which it would be subject to the adjudication and potentially unavailable to groundwater pumpers in the absence of valid surface water claims which historic groundwater pumpers typically do not have any recharacterization of groundwater as surface water could affect the ability of consumers farmers ranchers municipalities and industrial users like us to continue to access water supplies that have been relied on for decades because we are a user of both groundwater and surface water in arizona we are an active participant in the adjudication proceedings 

water for our cerro verde operation in peru comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the rio chili watershed that collects water primarily from seasonal precipitation as a result of occasional drought conditions temporary supply shortages are possible that could affect our cerro verde operations in january 2016 the peruvian government declared a temporary state of emergency with respect to the water supply in the rio chili basin because of drought conditions as a result the cerro verde water rights from the rio chili were temporarily decreased by 18 percent beginning in february 2016 the peruvian government will continue to evaluate supply availability in the subsequent months dependent on monthly precipitation 

water for our el abra mining operation in chile comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascotán aquifer in 2010 el abra obtained regulatory approval for the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascotán aquifer for its sulfide processing plant which began operations in 2011 the agreement to 

 57 

pump from this aquifer is subject to continued monitoring of the aquifer level to ensure that environmentally sensitive areas are not impacted by our pumping if impact occurs we would have to reduce pumping to restore water levels which could affect production from el abra 

although we typically have sufficient water for our indonesian operations lower rainfall resulting from el niño weather conditions in the second half of 2015 has impacted operations and may continue to impact operations in 2016 

although each of our mining operations currently has access to sufficient water supplies to support current operational demands as discussed above some supplies are subject to adjudication proceedings the outcome of which we cannot predict and the availability of additional supplies that may be required for potential future expansions is uncertain the loss of a water right or currently available water supply could force us to curtail operations or force premature closures thereby increasing andor accelerating costs or foregoing profitable operations 

in addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry our indonesia and africa mining operations involve additional risks because they are located in very remote areas and in indonesia unusually difficult terrain 

the grasberg minerals district is located in steep mountainous terrain in a remote area of indonesia these conditions have required us to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities in addition the area receives considerable rainfall which has led to periodic floods and mudslides the mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time our insurance may not sufficiently cover an unexpected natural or operating disaster 

underground mining operations can be particularly dangerous and in may 2013 a tragic accident which resulted in 28 fatalities and 10 injuries occurred at ptfi when the rock structure above the underground ceiling of a training facility collapsed ptfi temporarily suspended mining and processing activities at the grasberg complex to conduct inspections and resumed openpit mining and concentrating activities on june 24 2013 and underground operations on july 9 2013 no assurance can be given that similar events will not occur in the future 

the tenke minerals district is located in a remote area of the drc and is subject to challenges such as severely limited infrastructure including road bridge and rail access that is in disrepair and receives minimal maintenance limited and unreliable energy supply from antiquated equipment and from power distribution corridors that are not maintained difficulties in attracting and retaining experienced personnel security risks and limited health care in an area plagued by disease and other potential endemic health issues including malaria cholera and hiv 

additionally because of limited rail access we currently truck a significant portion of the production from the tenke minerals district approximately 1900 miles to ports in south africa the tenke minerals district and its future development may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control which could adversely affect its contribution to our operating results and increase the cost of future development 

we must continually replace reserves depleted by production but our exploration activities may not result in additional discoveries 

our existing mineral and oil and natural gas reserves will be depleted over time by production from our operations because our profits are derived from our mining and oil and gas operations our ability to replenish our reserves is essential to our longterm success our exploration projects involve many risks require substantial expenditures and may not result in the discovery of additional deposits or reservoirs that can be produced profitably we may not be able to discover enhance develop or acquire reserves in sufficient quantities to maintain or grow our current reserve levels which could negatively affect our business and prospects 

development projects are inherently risky and may require more capital than anticipated which could adversely affect our business 

consolidated capital expenditures are expected to approximate 34 billion  for 2016 including 19 billion from the mining business reflecting 14 billion  for major projects primarily for underground development activities at grasberg and remaining costs for the cerro verde expansion and 05 billion for sustaining capital and 15 billion  for oil and gas operations 

 58 

there are many risks and uncertainties inherent in all development projects the economic feasibility of development projects is based on many factors including the accuracy of estimated reserves estimated capital and operating costs and estimated future prices of the relevant commodity the capital expenditures and time required to develop new mines wells or other projects are considerable and changes in costs or construction or drilling schedules can adversely affect project economics 

new development projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future cash flow the actual costs production rates and economic returns of our development projects may differ materially from our estimates which may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

operations in the deepwater gom present greater operating risks than operations in the shallower waters or onshore in addition our shallow water and onshore operations that target ultradeep prospects involve greater risks and costs than conventional gom shelf and onshore gulf coast prospects   

the deepwater gom presents significant challenges because of risks associated with geological complexity water depth and higher drilling and development costs for example in april 2010 the deepwater horizon an unaffiliated offshore drilling rig located in the deepwater gom sank following an explosion and fire resulting in fatalities and the discharge of substantial amounts of oil into the gom until midjuly 2010 when the flow of oil was finally stopped the us department of interior imposed a moratorium on deepwater drilling from may through october 2010 and also issued a series of rules and notices to lessees and operators imposing new and more stringent regulatory safety and performance requirements and permitting procedures for new wells to be drilled in the deepwater gom all of which significantly and adversely disrupted oil and gas exploration activities in the gom and resulted in increased costs 

the deepwater gom also lacks the infrastructure present in shallower waters which can result in significant delays in obtaining or maintaining production as a result deepwater operations may require significant time between a discovery and marketability thereby increasing the financial risk of these operations 

our operations are subject to extensive regulations some of which require permits and other approvals these regulations increase our costs and in some circumstances may delay or suspend our operations 

our operations are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations that are subject to change and to changing interpretation by governmental agencies and other bodies vested with broad supervisory authority as a natural resource company compliance with environmental legal requirements is an integral and costly part of our business for additional information see environmental risks we are also subject to extensive regulation of worker health and safety including the requirements of the us occupational safety and health act and similar laws of other jurisdictions in the us the operation of our mines is subject to regulation by the us mine safety and health administration msha under the federal mine safety and health act of 1977 msha inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred if such inspections result in an alleged violation we may be subject to fines and penalties and in instances of alleged significant violations our mining operations could be subject to temporary or extended closures 

our oil and gas operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations that require among other things permits for the drilling and operation of wells and bonding and insurance to drill operate and plug and abandon wells and that regulate the safety of our pipelines our us offshore operations in federal waters are subject to broad regulation by the boembsee which among other things must issue permits in connection with our exploration drilling development and production plans under certain circumstances boembsee may impose penalties and may suspend or terminate any of our operations on federal leases many other governmental bodies regulate our operations and our failure to comply with these legal requirements can result in substantial penalties in addition new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations by courts or regulatory authorities occur regularly but are difficult to predict any such variations could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 

our business may be adversely affected by information technology disruptions 

cybersecurity incidents are increasing in frequency evolving in nature and include but are not limited to installation of malicious software unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the 

 59 

corruption of data we have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past and may experience them in the future we believe we have implemented appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks however given the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of information technology disruptions we could be subject to manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

environmental risks 

our operations are subject to complex evolving and increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations compliance with environmental regulatory requirements involves significant costs and may constrain existing operations or expansion opportunities 

our operations both in the us and internationally are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing the generation storage treatment transportation and disposal of hazardous substances solid waste disposal air emissions wastewater discharges remediation restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination including oil spill cleanup mine closures and reclamation well plug and abandonment requirements protection of endangered and protected species and designation of critical habitats and other related matters in addition we must obtain regulatory permits and approvals to start continue and expand operations 

our miami arizona smelter processes 44 percent of the aggregate copper concentrate produced by our north america copper mines epa regulations require us to invest in new pollution control equipment to reduce sulfur dioxide so 2  to meet both regional haze requirements and to allow the state of arizona to demonstrate compliance with epas so 2  ambient air quality standards the deadline for the smelter to install the so 2 pollution control equipment to comply with the regional haze rules is january 1 2018 the arizona rules for complying with the national ambient air quality standards are still being developed by state regulators and are subject to epa approval and it is not clear when they will become effective but it is possible that they will be effective prior to january 1 2018 we expect capital expenditures for this project to meet both regulatory requirements to total approximately 250 million and we expect those expenditures to be made through 2018 if these expenditures are delayed or deferred for technical financial or any other reasons we may be forced to curtail production at the miami smelter which would require us to export concentrate rather than process it ourselves and to purchase sulphuric acid that would otherwise be generated during the smelting process which would result in increased production costs 

laws such as cercla and similar state laws may expose us to joint and several liability for environmental damages caused by previous owners or operators of properties we acquired or are currently operating or at sites where we sent materials for processing recycling or disposal as discussed in more detail in the next risk factor we have substantial obligations for environmental remediation on mining properties previously owned or operated by freeport minerals corporation fmc and certain of its affiliates some of our onshore california oil and gas fields have been in operation for more than 100 years and legal requirements may require substantial expenditures to remediate the properties or to otherwise comply with these requirements noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in material penalties or other liabilities in addition compliance with these laws may from time to time result in delays in or changes to our development or expansion plans compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs which we expect will continue to increase over time because of increased regulatory oversight adoption of increasingly stringent environmental standards as well as other factors 

new or revised environmental regulatory requirements are frequently proposed many of which result in substantially increased costs for our business including those regarding financial assurance in the financial risk factor above in addition in 2015 the epa promulgated rules that could reclassify certain mineral processing materials as hazardous waste under the federal resource conservation and recovery act and subject the industry to significant new and costly waste management requirements these rules are currently being challenged by multiple parties in court however if the legal challenges are unsuccessful the reclassification of certain mineral processing materials as “hazardous waste’” could materially increase costs at our us copper and molybdenum processing facilities 

the epa also recently adopted rules that bring remote “tributaries” into the regulatory definition of “waters of the united states” that are protected by the clean water act thereby imposing significant additional restrictions on waterway discharges and land uses and is in many ways aggressively attempting to expand its regulatory authority over air quality water quality and solid wastes among other things regulations are also being considered at various governmental levels to increase federal financial responsibility requirements both for mine closure and reclamation and for oil and gas decommissioning and to increase regulation of or prohibit hydraulic fracturing 

 60 

adoption of these or similar new environmental regulations or more stringent application of existing regulations may materially increase our costs threaten certain operating activities and constrain our expansion opportunities 

in february 2016 the department of the interiors fish  wildlife service fws adopted final rules that broaden the regulatory definitions of critical habitat and destruction or adverse modification both of which are integral to the fwss implementation of the endangered species act which protects federallylisted endangered and threatened species the new rules increase fwss discretion to limit uses of land and water courses that may become suitable habitat for listed species in the future or that are occasionally used by protected species the new rules may limit the ability of landowners including us to obtain federal permits or authorizations needed for expansion of our operations and may also affect our ability to obtain retain or deliver water to some operations 

during 2015  we incurred environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs including our joint venture partners shares to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect our operations of 421 million  compared with 405 million  in 2014  and 595 million  in 2013  for 2016  we expect to incur approximately 495 million  of aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs the timing and amounts of estimated payments could change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements changes in scope and costs of reclamation and plug and abandonment activities the settlement of environmental matters and the rate at which actual spending occurs on continuing matters 

we incur significant costs for remediating environmental conditions on mining properties that have not been operated in many years 

fmc and its subsidiaries and many of their affiliates and predecessor companies have been involved in exploration mining milling smelting and manufacturing in the us for more than a century activities that occurred in the late 19th century and the 20th century prior to the advent of modern environmental laws were not subject to environmental regulation and were conducted before american industrial companies fully understood the longterm effects of their operations on the surrounding environment 

with the passage of cercla in 1980 companies like fmc became legally responsible for remediating hazardous substances released into the environment from properties owned or operated by them as well as properties where they arranged for disposal of such substances irrespective of when the release to the environment occurred or who caused it that liability is often asserted on a joint and several basis with other prior and subsequent owners operators and arrangers meaning that each owner or operator of the property is and each arranger may be held fully responsible for the remediation although in many cases some or all of the other responsible parties no longer exist do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found as a result because of our acquisition of fmc in 2007 many of the subsidiary companies we now own are potentially responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the us and we expect to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those remediation issues we are also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources at december 31 2015  we had more than 100  active remediation projects including damaged natural resource claims in 26  us states in addition fmc and certain affiliates and predecessor companies were parties to agreements relating to the transfer of businesses or properties which contained indemnification provisions relating to environmental matters and which from time to time become the source of claims against us 

at december 31 2015  we had 12 billion  recorded in our consolidated balance sheet for environmental obligations attributable to cercla or analogous state programs and for estimated future costs associated with environmental matters at closed facilities or closed portions of certain operating facilities our environmental obligation estimates are primarily based upon 

 

 

 

 61 

significant adjustments to these estimates are likely to occur in the future as additional information becomes available the actual environmental costs may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs and any such changes could be material 

in addition remediation standards imposed by the epa and state environmental agencies have generally become more stringent over time and may become even more stringent in the future imposition of more stringent remediation standards poses a risk that additional remediation work could be required at our active remediation sites and at sites that we have already remediated to the satisfaction of the responsible governmental agencies and may increase the risk of toxic tort litigation 

refer to note 12  for further discussion of our environmental obligations 

our indonesia mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges and future changes in environmental laws or unanticipated environmental impacts from those operations could require us to incur increased costs 

mining operations on the scale of our indonesia operations involve significant environmental risks and challenges our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of crushed and ground rock material called tailings that results from the process by which we physically separate the copper gold and silverbearing materials from the ore that we mine our tailings management plan which has been approved by the indonesian government uses the unnavigable river system in the highlands near our mine to transport the tailings to an engineered area in the lowlands where the tailings and natural sediments are managed in a deposition area lateral levees have been constructed to help contain the footprint of the tailings and to limit their impact in the lowlands 

another major environmental challenge is managing overburden which is the rock that must be moved aside in the mining process to reach the ore in the presence of air water and naturally occurring bacteria some overburden can generate acid rock drainage or acidic water containing dissolved metals that if not properly managed can adversely affect the environment in addition overburden stockpiles are subject to erosion caused by the large amounts of rainfall with the eroded stockpile material eventually being deposited in the lowlands tailings management area this additional material while predicted in our environmental studies could influence the deposition of finer tailings material in the estuary 

from time to time certain indonesian government officials have raised questions with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans including a suggestion that we implement a pipeline system rather than the river transport system for tailings management and disposition because our indonesia mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area a pipeline system would be costly difficult to construct and maintain and more prone to catastrophic failure and could therefore involve significant potentially adverse environmental issues based on our own studies and others conducted by third parties we do not believe that a pipeline system is necessary or practical 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change issues may increase our costs and adversely   affect our operations 

many scientists believe that emissions from the combustion of carbonbased fuels contribute to greenhouse effects and therefore contribute to climate change carbonbased energy is a significant input in our operations and our revenues include sales of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas and other carbonbased energy products the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would vary by operation based on particular geographic circumstances as a result of the paris agreement reached during the 21 st  conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change in 2015 a number of governments have pledged nationally determined contributions to control and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the us the epa has finalized regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions from new modified and existing power plants while these rules are being challenged in court increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may increase our costs and may also affect the demand for the oil and gas we produce 

 62 

other risks 

our holding company structure may impact our ability to service debt and our stockholders ’  ability to receive dividends  

we are a holding company with no material assets other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries as a result our ability to repay our indebtedness and pay dividends is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend loan debt repayment or otherwise our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to make funds available to us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends dividends from subsidiaries that are not wholly owned are shared with other equity owners cash at our international operations is also typically subject to foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation into the us 

in addition our subsidiaries may not be able to or be permitted to make distributions to us or repay loans to us to enable us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal restrictions as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries certain of our subsidiaries are parties to credit agreements that restrict their ability to make distributions or loan repayments to us if such subsidiary is in default under such agreements to repay any subordinated loan we may make to such subsidiary unless specified conditions are met or to transfer substantially all of the assets of such subsidiary without the consent of the lenders 

our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries assets upon their liquidation reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries creditors including any trade creditors 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult these provisions 

 

 

 

 

these provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by the board 

in addition because we are incorporated in delaware we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with or acquisition of us 

these provisions may deter an acquisition of us that might otherwise be attractive to stockholders

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in numerous legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business or are associated with environmental issues arising from legacy operations conducted over the years by freeport minerals corporation fmc and its affiliates we are also involved periodically in inquiries investigations and other proceedings initiated by or involving government agencies some of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief management does not believe based on currently available information that the outcome of any legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition although individual outcomes could be material to our operating results for a particular period depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period below is a discussion of our material water rights legal proceedings refer to note 12  for discussion of our other material legal proceedings 

water rights legal proceedings 

our operations in the western united states us require significant secure quantities of water for mining ore processing and related support facilities continuous operation of our mines is dependent on among other things our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies in the arid western us where certain of our mines are located water rights are often contested and disputes over water rights are generally timeconsuming expensive and not necessarily dispositive unless they resolve both actual and potential claims the loss of a water right or a currently available water supply could force us to curtail operations or force premature closures thereby increasing andor accelerating costs or foregoing profitable operations 

at our north america operations certain of our water supplies are supported by surface water rights which give us the right to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location in arizona where our operations use both surface and groundwater we are a participant in two active general stream adjudications in which the arizona courts have been attempting for over 40 years to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for two of the states largest river systems which primarily affect our morenci safford sierrita and miami mines the adjudications are addressing the state law claims of thousands of competing users including us as well as significant federal water claims that are potentially adverse to the state law claims of both surface water and groundwater users groundwater is treated differently from surface water under arizona law which historically allowed land owners to pump unlimited quantities of subsurface water subject only to the requirement of putting it to reasonable use however court decisions in one of the adjudications have concluded that underground water is often hydrologically connected to surface water so that it actually is surface water and is therefore subject to the arizona doctrine of prior appropriation as a result of which it would be subject to the adjudication and potentially unavailable to groundwater pumpers in the absence of valid surface water claims which historic groundwater pumpers typically do not have any recharacterization of groundwater as surface water could affect the ability of consumers farmers ranchers municipalities and industrial users like us to continue to access water supplies that have been relied on for decades because we are a user of both groundwater and surface water in arizona we are an active participant in the adjudication proceedings 

in re the general adjudication of all rights to use water in the little colorado water system and sources  apache county superior court no 6417 filed on or about february 17 1978 the principal parties in addition to us include the state of arizona the salt river project the arizona public service company the navajo nation the hopi indian tribe the san juan southern paiute tribe and the us on behalf of those tribes on its own behalf and on behalf of the white mountain apache tribe this case involves adjudication of water rights claims including federal claims in the little colorado river watershed 

in re the general adjudication of all rights to use water in the gila river system and sources  maricopa county superior court cause nos w1 salt w2 verde w3 upper gila and w4 san pedro this case was originally initiated in 1974 with the filing of a petition with the arizona state land department and was consolidated and transferred to the maricopa county superior court in 1981 the principal parties in addition to us include the state of arizona the gila valley irrigation district the franklin irrigation district the san carlos irrigation and drainage district the salt river project the san carlos apache tribe the gila river indian community gric and the us on behalf of those tribes on its own behalf and on behalf of the white mountain apache tribe the fort mcdowell mohaveapache indian community the salt river pimamaricopa indian community and the payson community of yavapai apache indians

prior to january 1 1983 various indian tribes filed suits in the us district court in arizona claiming superior rights to water being used by many other water users including us and claiming damages for prior use in derogation of their allegedly superior rights these federal proceedings have either been stayed pending the arizona superior court adjudications or have been settled 

the maricopa county superior court issued a decision in 2005 in the gila river adjudication that directed the arizona department of water resources adwr to prepare detailed recommendations regarding the delineation of the “subflow” zone of the san pedro river basin a tributary of the gila river according to the court the subflow zone is the subsurface area adjacent to the river where the court may find that groundwater is connected to the surface water such that groundwater pumping may reduce surface flows in violation of rights of holders of surface water rights although we have minimal interests in the san pedro river basin a decision that recharacterizes groundwater in that basin as surface water may set a precedent for other river systems in arizona that could have material implications for many commercial industrial municipal and agricultural users of groundwater including our arizona operations 

adwr produced its recommendations in june 2009 which were objected to by numerous parties following this and other court rulings in 2012 and 2013 adwr submitted a revised report in 2014 the court held hearings in 2015 to address the parties comments and objections and the issue is currently under advisement with the court also in 2014 adwr submitted a proposal for the next projects that it believes should be undertaken in the case including the development of procedures for cone of depression analyses to determine whether a well located outside of the subflow zone creates a cone of depression that intersects the subflow zone and causes a drawdown in the subflow of the river based on the cone of depression analyses wells outside of the subflow zone could be subject to the jurisdiction of the adjudication court which might then require the owners of those wells to either demonstrate a valid surface water claim to support the pumping refrain from pumping or pay damages on november 6 2014 the court held a hearing to address the parties’ comments to adwr’s revised report in may 2015 adwr submitted a report concerning cone of depression testing and in november 2015 several parties including us submitted comments to that report 

as part of the gila river adjudication the us has asserted numerous claims for express and implied reserved surface water and groundwater rights on nonindian federal lands throughout arizona these claims are related to reservations of federal land for specific purposes  eg  national parks military bases and wilderness areas unlike state lawbased water rights federal reserved water rights are given priority in the prior appropriation system based on the date the land was reserved not the date that water was first used on the land in addition federal reserved water rights if recognized by the court may enjoy greater protection from groundwater pumping than is accorded to state lawbased water rights 

because federal reserved water rights have not yet been quantified the task of determining how much water each federal reservation may use has been left to the gila river adjudication court several “contested cases” to quantify reserved water rights for particular federal reservations in arizona are currently pending in the adjudication for instance in re aravaipa canyon wilderness area  is a contested case to resolve the uss claims to water for the aravaipa canyon wilderness area these claims went to trial in 2015 and the parties are awaiting a decision in re fort huachuca  concerns the uss claims to water for an army base and is scheduled for trial in 2016   in re redfield canyon wilderness area  and in re san pedro riparian national conservation area  concern the uss claims to two other federal reservations and these cases are expected to go to trial in 2017 

in multiple instances the us asserts a right to all water in a particular watershed that was not effectively appropriated under state law prior to the establishment of the federal reservation this creates risks for both surface water users and groundwater users because such expansive claims may severely impede current and future uses of water within the same watershed federal reserved rights present additional risks to water users aside from the significant quantities of water claimed by the us of particular significance federal reserved rights enjoy greater protection from groundwater pumping than is accorded to state lawbased water rights 

because there are numerous federal reservations in watersheds across arizona the reserved water right claims of the us pose a significant risk to multiple operations including morenci and safford in the upper gila river watershed and sierrita in the santa cruz watershed because federal reserved water rights may adversely affect water uses at each of these operations we have been actively involved in litigation over these claims 

given the legal and technical complexity of these adjudications their long history and their longterm legal economic and political implications it is difficult to predict the timing or the outcome of these proceedings if we are 

 65 

unable to satisfactorily resolve the issues being addressed in the adjudications our ability to pump groundwater could be diminished or curtailed and our operations at morenci safford sierrita and miami could be adversely affected unless we are able to acquire alternative resources

copper gold molybdenum and oil 

following provides a brief discussion of our primary natural resources copper gold molybdenum and oil for further discussion of historical market prices of these commodities refer to mda 

copper 

copper is an internationally traded commodity and its prices are determined by the major metals exchanges – the london metal exchange lme new york mercantile exchange nymex and shanghai futures exchange prices on these exchanges generally reflect the worldwide balance of copper supply and demand and can be volatile and cyclical during 2014  the lme spot copper price ranged from a low of 286  per pound to a high of 338  per pound averaged 311  per pound and was 288  per pound at december 31 2014  

in general demand for copper reflects the rate of underlying world economic growth particularly in industrial production and construction according to wood mackenzie a widely followed independent metals market consultant copper’s enduse markets and their estimated shares of total consumption are construction 30 percent consumer products 28 percent electrical applications 19 percent transportation 12 percent and industrial machinery 11 percent 

gold 

gold is used for jewelry coinage and bullion as well as various industrial and electronic applications gold can be readily sold on numerous markets throughout the world benchmark prices are generally based on london bullion market association london pm quotations during 2014  the london pm gold price ranged from a low of 1142  per ounce to a high of 1385  per ounce averaged 1266  per ounce and was 1199  per ounce at december 31 2014

molybdenum 

molybdenum is a key alloying element in steel and the raw material for several chemicalgrade products used in catalysts lubrication smoke suppression corrosion inhibition and pigmentation molybdenum as a highpurity metal is also used in electronics such as flatpanel displays and in super alloys used in aerospace reference prices for molybdenum are available in several publications including metals week  ryan’s notes  and metal bulletin  during 2014  the weekly average price of molybdenum quoted by metals week  ranged from a low of 882  per pound to a high of 1500  per pound averaged 1141  per pound and was 900  per pound at december 31 2014  

oil 

oil products include transportation fuels fuel oils for heating and electricity generation asphalt and road oil and the feedstocks used to make chemicals plastics and synthetic materials the price of crude oil is set in the global marketplace with prices largely determined by regional benchmarks including brent west texas intermediate wti and heavy louisiana sweet prices generally reflect the worldwide supply and demand balance and can be volatile during 2014 the brent crude oil price ranged from a low of 5733  per barrel to a high of 11506  per barrel averaged 9945  per barrel and was 5733  per barrel at december 31 2014  

products and sales 

fcx’s consolidated revenues for 2014  primarily included sales of copper  60 percent  oil  20 percent  gold  7 percent  and molybdenum  6 percent  refer to note 16  for a summary of our consolidated revenues and operating income by business segment and geographic area 

ptfis copper concentrate sales to pt smelting ptfis 25 percent owned copper smelter and refinery in indonesia  refer to mining operations  smelting facilities and other mining properties for further discussion represented 8 percent  of our consolidated revenues in both 2014  and 2013  and 11 percent  in 2012  additionally oil and gas sales to phillips 66 company represented 12 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2014 no other customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated revenues in any of the past three years 

copper products 

we are one of the world’s leading producers of copper concentrate cathode and continuous cast copper rod during 2014  44 percent  of our mined copper was sold in concentrate 31 percent  as cathode and 25 percent  as rod 

our copper ore is generally processed either by smelting and refining or by solution extraction and electrowinning sxew before being subject to the smelting and refining process ore is crushed and treated to produce a copper concentrate with copper content of approximately 20 to 30 percent copper concentrate is then smelted  ie  subjected to extreme heat to produce copper anodes which weigh between 800 and 900 pounds each and have an average copper content of 995 percent the anodes are further treated by electrolytic refining to produce copper cathodes which weigh between 100 and 350 pounds each and have an average copper content of 9999 percent for ore subject to the sxew process copper is extracted from the ore by dissolving it with a weak sulphuric acid solution the copper content of the solution is increased in two additional solutionextraction stages and then the copperbearing solution undergoes an electrowinning process to produce cathode that is on average 9999 percent copper our copper cathodes are used as the raw material input for copper rod brass mill products and for other uses 

copper concentrate  we produce copper concentrate at six of our mines of which ptfi is our largest producer in north america copper concentrate is produced at our morenci bagdad sierrita and chino mines and is generally shipped to our miami smelter in arizona in south america copper concentrate is produced at our cerro verde mine 

copper cathode  we produce copper cathode at our electrolytic refinery located in el paso texas and at 10 of our mines in north america sxew cathode is produced from our morenci bagdad safford sierrita miami chino and tyrone mines in south america from our cerro verde and el abra mines and from the tenke minerals district in africa   atlantic copper slu atlantic copper our wholly owned copper smelting and refining unit in spain  refer to mining operations  smelting facilities and other mining properties for further discussion and pt smelting also produce copper cathode

continuous cast copper rod  we manufacture continuous cast copper rod at our facilities in el paso texas norwich connecticut and miami arizona primarily using copper cathode produced at our north america copper mines 

copper sales 

north america  the majority of the copper produced at our north america copper mines and refined in our el paso texas refinery is consumed at our rod plants the remainder of our north america copper production is sold in the form of copper cathode or copper concentrate under us dollardenominated annual contracts cathode and rod contract prices are generally based on the prevailing commodity exchange inc comex  a division of nymex monthly average spot price for the month of shipment and include a premium generally copper rod is sold to wire and cable manufacturers while cathode is sold to rod brass or tube fabricators during 2014  19 percent of our north america mines copper sales volumes were shipped to atlantic copper in the form of copper concentrate 

south america    production from our south america mines is sold as copper concentrate or copper cathode under us dollardenominated annual and multiyear contracts for the year 2015 our south america mines expect to sell approximately 50 to 60 percent of copper production in concentrate and the rest as cathode 

during 2014  21 percent of our south america mines copper sales volumes were shipped to atlantic copper in the form of copper concentrate 

substantially all of south america’s copper concentrate and cathode sales contracts provide final copper pricing in a specified future month generally one to four months from the shipment date primarily based on quoted lme monthly average spot copper prices revenues from south america’s concentrate sales are recorded net of treatment and refining charges  ie  fees paid to smelters and refiners that are generally negotiated annually including any applicable price participation charges that are based on the market price of copper in addition because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrates is unrecoverable from the smelting process revenues from south america’s concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances for unrecoverable metals which are a negotiated term of the contracts and vary by customer 

indonesia    ptfi sells its production in the form of copper concentrate which contains significant quantities of gold and silver under us dollardenominated longterm contracts ptfi also sells a small amount of copper concentrates in the spot market following is a summary of ptfi’s aggregate percentage concentrate sales to pt smelting atlantic copper and third parties for the last three years 



substantially all of ptfi’s concentrate sales contracts provide final copper pricing in a specified future month generally one to four months from the shipment date primarily based on quoted lme monthly average spot copper prices revenues from ptfi’s concentrate sales are recorded net of royalties export duties treatment charges and allowances for unrecoverable metals 

africa  tfm sells its production in the form of copper cathode under us dollardenominated contracts substantially all of tfms cathode sales provide final copper pricing in the month after the shipment date based on quoted lme monthly average spot copper prices revenues from tfms cathode sales are recorded net of royalties and also include adjustments for pointofsale transportation costs that are negotiated in customer contracts 

gold products and sales 

we produce gold mostly from the grasberg minerals district gold is primarily sold as a component of our copper concentrate or in slimes which are a product of the smelting and refining process at atlantic copper gold generally is priced at the average london price for a specified month near the month of shipment revenues from gold sold as a component of our copper concentrate are recorded net of treatment and refining charges revenues from gold sold in slimes are recorded net of refining charges

molybdenum products and sales 

we are the world’s largest producer of molybdenum and molybdenumbased chemicals in addition to production from our henderson and climax molybdenum mines we produce molybdenum concentrate at certain of our north america copper mines and our cerro verde copper mine in peru the majority of our molybdenum concentrates are processed in our own conversion facilities molybdenum generally is priced based on the average metals week  price for the month prior to the month of shipment 

cobalt and silver products and sales 

we produce cobalt hydroxide at the tenke minerals district cobalt hydroxide is priced at a discount to the average monthly low price as published by metal bulletin or using lmebased pricing for a specified month near the month of shipment 

we also produce silver as a component of our copper concentrate or in slimes silver generally is priced at the average london price for a specified month near the month of shipment 

oil and gas products and sales 

we produce and sell oil and gas in the us our oil production is primarily sold under contracts with prices based upon regional benchmarks approximately 40 percent of our gas production is sold monthly based on published index pricing with the remainder priced daily on the spot market 

approximately 70 percent of our california production is attributable to heavy crude oil which is primarily sold under a longterm contract with prices based upon regional benchmarks in the gom our share of oil and gas production is sold under a series of contracts pursuant to which crude oil is sold directly to refineries in the gulf coast regions of texas and louisiana at prices based on widely used industry benchmarks 

labor matters 

at december 31 2014  we employed approximately 35000 people 13200 in the us 12000 in indonesia 4900 in south america 3500 in africa and 1400 in europe and other locations additionally we have contractors that have personnel at many of our operations including approximately 19800 at our south america mining operations including contractors for the cerro verde expansion 18000 at the grasberg   minerals district 4600 at the tenke minerals district 3400 in the us and 500 in europe and other locations the number of employees represented by unions at december 31 2014 and the expiration date of the applicable union agreements are listed below

environmental and reclamation matters 

the cost of complying with environmental laws is a fundamental and substantial cost of our business for information about environmental regulation litigation and related costs refer to item 1a “risk factors” and notes 1  and 12  

competition 

the top 10 producers of copper comprise approximately half of total worldwide mined copper production we currently rank second among those producers with approximately eight percent of total worldwide estimated mined copper production our competitive position is based on the size quality and grade of our ore bodies and our ability to manage costs compared with other producers we have a diverse portfolio of mining operations with varying ore grades and cost structures our costs are driven by the location grade and nature of our ore bodies and the level of input costs including energy labor and equipment the metals markets are cyclical and our ability to maintain our competitive position over the long term is based on our ability to acquire and develop quality deposits hire and retain a skilled workforce and to manage our costs

indonesia 

ownership  ptfi is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the republic of indonesia we directly own 8128 percent of the outstanding common stock of ptfi and indirectly own 936 percent through our wholly owned subsidiary pt indocopper investama the indonesian government owns the remaining 936 percent 

 16 

ptfi has established an unincorporated joint venture with rio tinto under which rio tinto has a 40 percent interest in certain assets and future production exceeding specified annual amounts of copper gold and silver through 2021 in block a of ptfis contract of work cow and after 2021 a 40 percent interest in all production from block a refer to note 3  for further discussion of the joint venture agreement 

contracts of work  ptfi conducts its current exploration and mining operations in indonesia through a cow with the indonesian government the cow governs our rights and obligations relating to taxes exchange controls royalties repatriation and other matters and was concluded pursuant to the 1967 foreign capital investment law which expresses indonesia’s foreign investment policy and provides basic guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization a framework for economic incentives and basic rules regarding other rights and obligations of foreign investors specifically the cow provides that the indonesian government will not nationalize or expropriate ptfi’s mining operations any disputes regarding the provisions of the cow are subject to international arbitration however we have not had an arbitration during the more than 40 years we have operated in indonesia 

ptfi’s original cow was entered into in 1967 and was replaced by the current cow in 1991 the initial term of the current cow expires in 2021 but can be extended for two 10year periods subject to indonesian government approval which pursuant to the cow cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably the cow allows us to conduct exploration mining and production activities in the 24700acre block a area which is where all of ptfi’s proven and probable mineral reserves and all its current mining operations are located under the cow ptfi also conducts exploration activities in the block b area currently covering 502000 acres ongoing negotiations for an amended cow discussed below and in note 13  may result in relinquishments of the block b acreage 

ptfi pays royalties on copper gold and silver in the concentrate it sells prior to the modifications discussed below as of a result of the july 25 2014 memorandum of understanding mou ptfi had agreed to pay additional royalties to the indonesian government that are not required under its cow the additional royalties provided further support to the local governments and to the people of the indonesian province of papua ptfi’s share of the royalties totaled 115 million  in 2014  including the increased royalties per the mou discussed below 109 million  in 2013  and 93 million  in 2012  additionally during 2014 ptfi paid export duties totaling 77 million  in accordance with regulations issued by the indonesian government on july 25 2014 refer to note 13  and “regulatory matters” below for further discussion of increased royalties and export taxes 

through joint venture agreements under separate cows we were allowed to conduct exploration activities in papua indonesia through two other entities pt nabire bakti mining ptnbm and pt irja eastern minerals eastern minerals of which we own 100 percent the cows for ptnbm and eastern minerals expired in 2013 and we are working with the indonesia government to complete the process to terminate the cows and return the exploration areas to the indonesia government we have completed the required notifications and reviews and are awaiting the termination acceptance documents 

regulatory matters  as further discussed in item 1a risk factors ptfi has been engaged in discussions with officials of the indonesian government since 2012 regarding various provisions of its cow the indonesian government has sought to modify existing mining contracts including ptfi’s cow to address provisions of indonesia’s 2009 mining law and subsequent regulations including with respect to the size of contract concessions government revenues domestic processing of minerals divestment provision of local services conversion from a contract of work to a licensing framework for extension periods and a requirement that extensions may be applied for only within two years prior to a contract of work’s expiration 

in january 2014 the indonesian government published regulations providing that holders of contracts of work with existing processing facilities in indonesia may continue to export product through january 12 2017 but established new requirements for the continued export of copper concentrates including the imposition of a progressive export duty on copper concentrates despite ptfi’s rights under its cow to export concentrates without the payment of duties ptfi was unable to obtain administrative approval for exports and operated at approximately half of its capacity from midjanuary 2014 through july 2014 

on july 25 2014 ptfi entered into a mou with the indonesian government under which ptfi and the government agreed to negotiate an amended cow to address provisions related to the size of ptfi’s concession area royalties and taxes domestic processing and refining divestment local content and continuation of operations post2021 execution of the mou enabled the resumption of concentrate exports which began in august 

 17 

2014 the mou has been extended to july 25 2015 ptfi is engaged in active discussions with the indonesian government regarding an amended cow 

provisions being addressed in the negotiation of an amended cow include the development of new copper smelting and refining capacity in indonesia divestment to the indonesian government andor indonesian nationals of up to a 30 percent interest an additional 2064 percent interest in ptfi at fair value and timely granting rights for the continuation of operations from 2022 through 2041 negotiations are taking into consideration ptfi’s need for assurance of legal and fiscal terms post2021 for ptfi to continue with its largescale investment program for the development of its underground reserves 

effective with the signing of the mou ptfi provided a 115 million assurance bond to support its commitment for smelter development agreed to increase royalties to 40 percent for copper and 375 percent for gold from the previous rates of 35 percent for copper and 10 percent for gold and to pay export duties as set forth in a new regulation the indonesian government revised its january 2014 regulations regarding export duties which are now set at 75 percent declining to 50 percent when smelter development progress exceeds 75 percent and are eliminated when development progress exceeds 30 percent 

ptfi is advancing plans for the construction of new smelter capacity in parallel with completing negotiations of its longterm operating rights and will also discuss the possibility of expanding industrial activities in papua in connection with its longterm development plans ptfi has identified a site adjacent to the existing pt smelting site in gresik indonesia for the construction of additional smelter capacity refer to “mining development projects and exploration” for further discussion 

under the mou no terms of the cow other than those relating to the export duties the smelter bond and royalties described above will be changed until the completion of an amended cow 

ptfi is required to apply for renewal of export permits at sixmonth intervals in january 2015 ptfi obtained a renewal of its export license through july 25 2015 

grasberg minerals district  ptfi operates in the remote highlands of the sudirman mountain range in the province of papua indonesia which is on the western half of the island of new guinea we and our predecessors have been the only operator of exploration and mining activities in block a since 1967 

the grasberg minerals district has three operating mines the grasberg open pit the deep ore zone doz underground mine and the big gossan underground mine we also have several projects in progress in the grasberg minerals district related to the development of the largescale longlived highgrade underground ore bodies located beneath and nearby the grasberg open pit in aggregate these underground ore bodies are expected to ramp up over several years to process approximately 240000 metric tons of ore per day following the transition from the grasberg open pit currently anticipated to occur in late 2017 refer to mda for further discussion 

ptfi’s production including our joint venture partner’s share totaled 651 million  pounds of copper and 113 million  ounces of gold in 2014  928 million  pounds of copper and 114 million  ounces of gold in 2013  and 695 million  pounds of copper and 862 thousand  ounces of gold in 2012  

our principal source of power for all our indonesian operations is a coalfired power plant that we built in 1998 diesel generators supply peaking and backup electrical power generating capacity a combination of naturally occurring mountain streams and water derived from our underground operations provides water for our operations our indonesian operations are in an active seismic zone and experience average annual rainfall of approximately 200 inches 

grasberg open pit 

we began openpit mining of the grasberg ore body in 1990 with mining operations expected to continue through the end of 2017 production in the open pit is currently at the 3220 to 3760meter elevation level and totaled 24 million metric tons of ore in 2014  which provided 55 percent of ptfis 2014  mill feed 

the current openpit equipment fleet consists of over 500 units the larger mining equipment directly associated with production includes an available fleet of 150 haul trucks with payloads ranging from 218 to 330 metric tons and 

 18 

16 shovels with bucket sizes ranging from 30 to 42 cubic meters which mined an average of 298000 metric tons of material per day during 2014  381000 metric tons per day in 2013  and 399000 metric tons per day in 2012  

grasberg crushing and conveying systems are integral to the mine and provide the capacity to transport up to 150000 metric tons per day of grasberg ore to the mill and 75000 metric tons per day of overburden to the overburden stockpiles the remaining overburden is moved by haul trucks ore milled from the grasberg openpit averaged 69100  metric tons of ore per day for the year 2014 and is expected to approximate 125000 metric tons of ore per day for the year 2015 

doz underground mine 

the doz ore body lies vertically below the now depleted intermediate ore zone we began production from the doz ore body in 1989 using open stope mining methods but suspended production in 1991 in favor of production from the grasberg open pit production resumed in september 2000 using the blockcave method and is at the 3110meter elevation level ore milled from the doz mine averaged 50500  metric tons of ore per day for the year 2014  and is expected to ramp up to approximately 70000 metric tons of ore per day in the second half of 2015 production at the doz mine is expected to continue through 2020 

the doz mine fleet consists of over 250 pieces of mobile equipment which is capable of mining an average of 80000 metric tons of material per day the primary mining equipment directly associated with production and development includes an available fleet of 52 lhd units and 20 haul trucks each production lhd unit typically carries approximately 11 metric tons of ore using ore passes and chutes the lhd units transfer ore into 55metric ton capacity haul trucks the trucks dump into two gyratory crushers and the ore is then conveyed to the surface stockpiles for processing 

the success of the development of the doz mine one of the world’s largest underground mines provides confidence in the future development of ptfi’s largescale undeveloped underground ore bodies 

big gossan underground mine 

the big gossan mine lies underground and adjacent to the current mill site it is a tabular near vertical ore body with approximate dimensions of 1200 meters along strike and 800 meters down dip with varying thicknesses from 20 meters to 120 meters the mine utilizes a blasthole stoping method with delayed paste backfill stopes of varying sizes are mined and the ore dropped down passes to a truck haulage level trucks are chute loaded and transport the ore to a jaw crusher the crushed ore is then hoisted vertically via a twoskip production shaft to a level where it is loaded onto a conveyor belt the belt carries the ore to one of the main underground conveyors where the ore is transferred and conveyed to the surface stockpiles for processing 

although development activities continue production from the big gossan underground mine was suspended for the majority of 2014 ore milled from the big gossan underground mine averaged 900  metric tons of ore per day for the year 2014  and is expected to ramp up to 7000 metric tons of ore per day in 2018 

the big gossan underground mine fleet consists of over 100 pieces of mobile equipment which includes five lhd units and three haul trucks used in development and production activities 

description of ore bodies   our indonesia ore bodies are located within and around two main igneous intrusions the grasberg monzodiorite and the ertsberg diorite the host rocks of these ore bodies include both carbonate and clastic rocks that form the ridge crests and upper flanks of the sudirman range and the igneous rocks of monzonitic to dioritic composition that intrude them the igneoushosted ore bodies the grasberg open pit and block cave and portions of the doz block cave occur as vein stockworks and disseminations of copper sulfides dominated by chalcopyrite and to a lesser extent bornite the sedimentaryrock hosted ore bodies portions of the doz and all of the big gossan occur as “magnetiterich calciummagnesian skarn” replacements whose location and orientation are strongly influenced by major faults and by the chemistry of the carbonate rocks along the margins of the intrusions 

the copper mineralization in these skarn deposits is dominated by chalcopyrite but higher bornite concentrations are common moreover gold occurs in significant concentrations in all of the district’s ore bodies though rarely visible to the naked eye these gold concentrations usually occur as inclusions within the copper sulfide minerals though in some deposits these concentrations can also be strongly associated with pyrite

as the regional geological and hydrogeological conditions indicate that adequate water is available during the expected life of the operation 

smelting facilities and other mining properties 

atlantic copper  our wholly owned atlantic copper smelter and refinery is located on land concessions from the huelva spain port authorities which are scheduled to expire in 2027 

the design capacity of the smelter is approximately 300000 metric tons of copper per year and the refinery currently has a capacity of 285000 metric tons of copper per year during 2014  atlantic copper treated 11 million metric tons of concentrate and scrap and produced 294100 metric tons of copper anodes from its smelter and 283800 metric tons of copper cathodes from its refinery following is a summary of atlantic coppers concentrate purchases from our copper mining operations and third parties for the last three years 



during 2013 atlantic copper successfully completed a scheduled 68day major maintenance turnaround atlantic coppers major maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately every eight years with shortterm maintenance turnarounds in the interim the next shortterm maintenance turnaround is scheduled for the second half of 2015 

pt smelting  ptfi’s cow required us to construct or cause to be constructed a smelter in indonesia if we and the indonesian government determined that such a project would be economically viable in 1995 following the completion of a feasibility study we entered into agreements relating to the formation of pt smelting an indonesian company and the construction of the copper smelter and refinery in gresik indonesia pt smelting owns and operates the smelter and refinery ptfi owns 25 percent of pt smelting with the remainder owned by mitsubishi materials corporation 605 percent mitsubishi corporation unimetals ltd 95 percent and jx nippon mining  metals corporation 5 percent 

ptfi’s contract with pt smelting provides for the supply of 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements subject to a minimum or maximum rate necessary for pt smelting to produce 205000 metric tons of copper annually on a priority basis ptfi also sells copper concentrate to pt smelting at market rates for quantities in excess of 205000 metric tons of copper annually 

during 2014  pt smelting treated 911500 metric tons of concentrate and produced 236900 metric tons of copper anodes from its smelter and 231800 metric tons of copper cathodes from its refinery 

pt smeltings maintenance turnarounds which range from two weeks to a month to complete typically are expected to occur approximately every two years with shortterm maintenance turnarounds in the interim pt smelting completed a 23day maintenance turnaround during 2014 and the next major maintenance turnaround is scheduled for 2016 

miami smelter  we own and operate a smelter at our miami arizona mining operation the smelter has been operating for approximately 100 years and has been upgraded numerous times during that period to implement new technologies to improve production and to comply with air quality requirements as a result of new air quality standards for sulfur dioxide emissions the miami smelter will install pollution control equipment as part of an expansion that will allow the smelter to operate and comply with the new standards by 2018 

the miami smelter processes copper concentrate primarily from our arizona copper mines concentrate processed through the smelter totaled 603700 metric tons in 2014  in addition because sulphuric acid is a byproduct of smelting concentrates the miami smelter is also the most significant source of sulphuric acid for our north america leaching operations 

major maintenance turnarounds which take approximately three weeks to complete typically occur approximately every 14 months for the miami smelter with shorter term maintenance turnarounds in the interimthe scheduled 

 22 

shutdown in fourthquarter 2014 was extended for several weeks as a result of a furnace fire repairs have been completed and the smelter is operating at normal rates 

rod  refining operations  our rod  refining operations consist of conversion facilities located in north america including a refinery in el paso texas rod mills in el paso texas norwich connecticut and miami arizona and a specialty copper products facility in bayway new jersey we refine our copper anode production from our miami smelter at our el paso refinery the el paso refinery has the potential to operate at an annual production capacity of about 900 million pounds of copper cathode which is sufficient to refine all of the copper anode we produce at miami our el paso refinery also produces nickel carbonate copper telluride and autoclaved slimes material containing gold silver platinum and palladium 

molybdenum conversion facilities  we process molybdenum concentrates at our conversion plants in the us and europe into such products as technicalgrade molybdic oxide ferromolybdenum pure molybdic oxide ammonium molybdates and molybdenum disulfide we operate molybdenum roasters in sierrita arizona fort madison iowa and rotterdam the netherlands and we operate a molybdenum pressure leach plant in bagdad arizona we also produce ferromolybdenum for customers worldwide at our conversion plant located in stowmarket united kingdom 

freeport cobalt  on march 29 2013 we through a newly formed consolidated joint venture completed the acquisition of a cobalt chemical refinery in kokkola finland and the related sales and marketing business the acquisition provides direct endmarket access for the cobalt hydroxide production at the tenke minerals district the joint venture operates under the name freeport cobalt and we are the operator with an effective 56 percent ownership interest the remaining effective ownership interest is held by our partners in tfm including 24 percent by lundin and 20 percent by gécamines the kokkola refinery has an annual refining capacity of approximately 12000 metric tons of cobalt sufficient to refine the majority of the cobalt we produce in the tenke minerals district 

other north america copper mines  in addition to our operating mines we have five nonoperating copper mines in north america – ajo bisbee twin buttes and tohono in arizona and cobre in new mexico – that have been on careandmaintenance status for several years and would require new or updated environmental studies new permits and additional capital investment which could be significant to return them to operating status 

mining development projects and exploration 

we have several projects and potential opportunities to expand production volumes extend mine lives and develop largescale underground ore bodies our nearterm major development projects which require substantial additional capital investment include the cerro verde expansion and underground development activities in grasberg refer to mda for further discussion of these and our other development projects considering the longterm nature and large size of our development projects actual costs and timing could vary from estimates we continue to review our mine development and processing plans to maximize the value of our mineral reserves 

capital expenditures for mining operations totaled 40 billion  including 29 billion  for major projects in 2014 38 billion  including 23 billion  for major projects in 2013 and 35 billion  including 22 billion  for major projects in 2012 capital expenditures for major projects are primarily associated with the expansion projects at morenci and cerro verde and underground development activities at grasberg capital expenditures for major projects for the year 2012 also included amounts associated with the expansion at tenke fungurume capital expenditures for major projects at mining operations in the year 2015 are expected to approximate 25 billion  and are primarily associated with the cerro verde expansion and underground development activities at grasberg 

in connection with the mou between ptfi and the indonesia government we have agreed to pursue construction of a new smelter in indonesia subject to reaching agreement on our longterm operating rights the preliminary scope of the smelting facilities and associated refinery involves smelting and refining capacity of approximately two million metric tons per year of copper concentrate site selection and project definition studies are being advanced planning for engineering activities is underway as we explore partnership options we will be reviewing project scope during 2015 

 23 

we also have an additional longterm underground mine development project in the grasberg minerals district for the kucing liar ore body which lies on the southern flank of and underneath the southern portion of the grasberg open pit at the 2605meter elevation level we expect to mine the kucing liar ore body using the blockcave method aggregate capital cost estimates for development of the kucing liar ore body are projected to approximate 24 billion which are expected to be made between 2019 and 2032 additionally our current mine development plans include approximately 5 billion of capital expenditures at our processing facilities to optimize the handling of underground ore types once the grasberg openpit operations cease we expect substantially all of these expenditures to be m ade between 2016 and 2034   

our exploration activities are generally near our existing mines with a focus on opportunities to expand reserves and resources to support development of additional future production capacity in the large minerals districts where we currently operate exploration results continue to indicate opportunities for significant future reserve additions in north and south america and in the tenke minerals district the drilling data in north america also indicates the potential for significantly expanded sulfide production drilling results and exploration modeling in north america have identified large scale potential sulfide resources in the morenci and safford districts providing a longterm pipeline for future growth in reserves and production capacity in an established minerals district exploration spending associated with mining operations totaled 96 million  in 2014 182 million in 2013 and 251 million in 2012 and is expected to approximate 100 million  for the year 2015 

sources and availability of energy natural resources and raw materials 

our copper mining operations require significant energy principally diesel electricity coal and natural gas most of which is obtained from third parties under longterm contracts energy represented approximately 20 percent  of our 2014  consolidated copper production costs and included purchases of approximately 250 million  gallons of diesel fuel 7600  gigawatt hours of electricity at our north america south america and africa copper mining operations we generate all of our power at our indonesia mining operation 600 thousand  metric tons of coal for our coal power plant in indonesia and 1  million british thermal units mmbtu of natural gas at certain of our north america mines based on current cost estimates we estimate energy will approximate 16 percent  of our consolidated copper production costs for 2015 

our mining operations also require significant quantities of water for mining ore processing and related support facilities although we believe our mining operations have sufficient water rights the loss of water rights for any of our mines in whole or in part or shortages of water to which we have rights could require us to curtail or shut down mining operations for a further discussion of risks and legal proceedings associated with the availability of water refer to item 1a “risk factors” and item 3 “legal proceedings” 

sulphuric acid is used in the sxew process and is produced as a byproduct of the smelting process at our smelters and from our sulphur burners at the safford and tenke mines sulphuric acid needs in excess of the sulphuric acid produced by our operations are purchased from third parties 

community and human rights 

we have adopted policies that govern our working relationships with the communities where we operate and are designed to guide our practices and programs in a manner that respects human rights and the culture of the local people impacted by our operations we continue to make significant expenditures on community development education training and cultural programs which include 

 

in december 2000 we endorsed the joint us state departmentbritish foreign office voluntary principles on human rights and security voluntary principles we participated in developing these voluntary principles with other major natural resource companies and international human rights organizations and they are incorporated into our human rights policy and site level projects 

 24 

we completed a corporate level human rights impact assessment in 2014 the results of which were used to evaluate our human rights program including a review of our human rights policy in february 2015 we updated our human rights policy to among other things reflect our commitment to integrating the united nations guiding principles on business and human rights into our human rights program we also participate in a multiindustry human rights working group to gain insight from peer companies and evaluate ways to integrate human rights due diligence into our business practices and to support our human rights program 

we believe that our social and economic development programs are responsive to the issues raised by the local communities near our areas of operation and should help us maintain good relations with the surrounding communities and avoid disruptions of mining operations as part of our ongoing annual commitment to sustainable community development we have made significant investments in social programs including inkind support and administration across our global operations over the last five years these investments have averaged 185 million per year nevertheless social and political instability in the areas of our operations may adversely impact our mining operations refer to item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

south america  cerro verde has provided a variety of community support projects over the years following engagements with regional and local governments civic leaders and development agencies in 2006 cerro verde committed to support the costs for a new potable water treatment plant to serve arequipa in addition an agreement was reached with the peruvian government for development of a water storage and distribution network which was financed by the cerro verde civil association the association the association manages contributions made by cerro verde for projects that focus on education training health cultural preservation and basic infrastructure 

cerro verde has also reached agreement with the regional government of arequipa the national government sedapar and other local institutions to allow it to finance engineer and construct a wastewater treatment plant for the city of arequipa treating this water will improve the regional water quality enhance agriculture products grown in the area and reduce waterborne illnesses in addition to these projects cerro verde annually makes significant community development investments in the arequipa region 

indonesia  in 1996 ptfi established the freeport partnership fund for community development the partnership fund through which ptfi has made available funding and technical assistance to support community development initiatives in the areas of health education and economic development of the area ptfi has committed through 2016 to provide one percent of its annual revenue for the development of the local people in its area of operation through the partnership fund our share of contributions to the partnership fund totaled 31 million  in 2014  41 million  in 2013  and 39 million  in 2012  

the amungme and kamoro community development organization  lembaga pengembangan masyarakat amungme dan kamoro  or lpmak oversees disbursement of the program funds we contribute to the partnership fund lpmak is governed by a board of commissioners and a board of directors which are comprised of representatives from the local amungme and kamoro tribal communities government leaders church leaders and one representative of ptfi on each board the amungme and kamoro people are original inhabitants of the land in our area of operations in addition to the partnership fund ptfi annually makes significant investments in public health education community infrastructure and economic development 

security matters    consistent with our cow in indonesia and our commitment to protect our employees and property we have taken steps to provide a safe and secure working environment as part of its security program ptfi maintains its own internal security department both employees and contractors are unarmed and perform functions such as protecting company facilities monitoring shipments of supplies and products assisting in traffic control and aiding in emergency response operations the security department receives human rights training annually 

ptfi’s share of costs for its internal civilian security department totaled 57 million for 2014  51 million for 2013  and 52 million for 2012  

ptfi and all businesses and residents of indonesia rely on the indonesian government for the maintenance of public order upholding the rule of law and the protection of personnel and property the grasberg minerals district has been designated by the indonesian government as one of indonesia’s vital national assets this designation results in the police and to a lesser extent the military playing a significant role in protecting the area of our 

 25 

operations the indonesian government is responsible for employing police and military personnel and directing their operations 

from the outset of ptfi’s operations the indonesian government has looked to ptfi to provide logistical and infrastructure support and assistance for these necessary services because of the limited resources of the indonesian government and the remote location of and lack of development in papua ptfi’s financial support for the indonesian government security institutions assigned to the operations area represents a prudent response to its requirements to protect its workforce and property better ensuring that personnel are properly fed and lodged and have the logistical resources to patrol ptfi’s roads and secure its operating area in addition the provision of such support is consistent with ptfi’s obligations under the cow reflects our philosophy of responsible corporate citizenship and is in keeping with our commitment to pursue practices that will promote human rights 

ptfi’s share of support costs for the governmentprovided security was 27 million in 2014  25 million in 2013  and 22 million in 2012  this supplemental support consists of various infrastructure and other costs such as food housing fuel travel vehicle repairs allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs and community assistance programs conducted by the military and police 

refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion of security risks in indonesia 

africa  tfm has committed to assist the communities living within its concession in the katanga province of the drc initiatives include an integrated malaria control program construction renovation and building of local health facilities construction and renovation of local schools installation of over 100 clean water wells in rural villages as well as construction of urban water distribution systems and economic development programs supporting development and training of local entrepreneurs contractors and farmers we have also made significant investments in infrastructure in the region that will have lasting benefits to the country including upgrading a portion of a national road and the regional power generation and transmission systems 

through the armc tfm has also committed to contribute 03 percent of its net sales revenue to a community development fund to assist the local communities with development of local infrastructure and related services including health education and agriculture the tfm social community fund is managed by a board of directors comprised of two local community representatives one representative nominated by the provincial governor and four tfm representatives a community stakeholder forum comprised of 40 community representatives provides for increased community participation and input regarding project priorities community needs and transparency of fund management the tfm social community fund contributions totaled 4 million  in each of the years 2014  2013  and 2012  

security matters  tfm maintains an unarmed internal security department composed of both employees and contractors the national government also has assigned mines police to the tfm concession area the mines police are a division of the congolese national police and are responsible for maintaining security in mining concessions throughout the drc tfm provides food housing medical services supervised transportation nonlethal equipment and monetary allowances as well as direct payments to the government for the provision of the security assigned to the concession area the total cost to tfm for this support including inkind support totaled 2 million in 2014 and less than 1 million in both 2013  and 2012  

tfm also participates in monthly security coordination meetings with host country security personnel other mining companies nongovernmental organizations and representatives from the united nations to discuss security issues and concerns as an outcome of the coordination meetings tfm has partnered with monusco united nations stabilization mission in the drc to conduct human rights training in the tfm concession for host government security personnel local representatives and tfm security employees

mineral reserves 

recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves from our mining operations summarized below and detailed on the following pages have been calculated as of december 31 2014  in accordance with industry guide 7 as required by the securities exchange act of 1934 proven and probable reserves may not be comparable to similar information regarding mineral reserves disclosed in accordance with the guidance of other countries proven and probable mineral reserves were determined by the use of mapping drilling sampling assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry as more fully discussed below the term “reserve” as used in the reserve data presented here means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination the term “proven reserves” means mineral reserves for which i quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops trenches workings or drill holes ii grade andor quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and iii the sites for inspection sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established the term “probable reserves” means mineral reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced the degree of assurance although lower than that for proven reserves is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 

our mineral reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies we conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk we revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies our estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves are prepared by and are the responsibility of our employees a majority of these estimates are reviewed and verified by independent experts in mining geology and reserve determination 

estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves at december 31 2014  were determined using longterm average prices of 200  per pound for copper consistent with the longterm average copper price used since december 31 2010 1000  per ounce for gold and 10  per pound for molybdenum for the threeyear period ended december 31 2014  lme spot copper prices averaged 335  per pound london pm gold prices averaged 1449  per ounce and the weekly average price of molybdenum quoted by metals week  averaged 1150  per pound 

the recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves presented in the table below represent the estimated metal quantities from which we expect to be paid after application of estimated metallurgical recovery rates and smelter recovery rates where applicable recoverable reserves are the part of a mineral deposit that we estimate can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination

in defining our openpit reserves we apply a “variable cutoff grade” strategy the objective of this strategy is to maximize the net present value of our operations we use a breakeven cutoff grade to define the insitu reserves for our underground ore bodies the breakeven cutoff grade is defined for a metric ton of ore as that equivalent copper grade once produced and sold that generates sufficient revenue to cover all operating and administrative costs associated with our production 

our copper mines may contain other commercially recoverable metals such as gold molybdenum silver and cobalt we value all commercially recoverable metals in terms of a copper equivalent percentage to determine a single cutoff grade copper equivalent percentage is used to express the relative value of multimetal ores in terms of one metal the calculation expresses the relative value of the ore using estimates of contained metal quantities metals prices as used for reserve determination recovery rates treatment charges and royalties our molybdenum properties use a molybdenum cutoff grade 

the table below shows the minimum cutoff grade by process for each of our existing ore bodies as of december 31 2014  



 33 

drill hole spacing data is used by mining professionals such as geologists and geological engineers in determining the suitability of data coverage on a relative basis in a given deposit type and mining method scenario so as to achieve a given level of confidence in the resource estimate drill hole spacing is only one of several criteria necessary to establish resource classification drilling programs are typically designed to achieve an optimum sample spacing to support the level of confidence in results that apply to a particular stage of development of a mineral deposit 

the following table sets forth the average drill hole spacing based on average sample distance or drill pattern spacing for proven and probable ore reserves by process type 



 34 

production sequencing 

the following chart illustrates our current plans for sequencing and producing our proven and probable reserves at each of our ore bodies and the years in which we currently expect production from each ore body and from related stockpiles the chart also shows the term of ptfis cow production volumes are typically lower in the first few years for each ore body as development activities are ongoing and as the mine ramps up to full production and production volumes may also be lower as the mine reaches the end of its life the ultimate timing of the start of production from our undeveloped mines is dependent upon a number of factors including the results of our exploration and development efforts and may vary from the dates shown below in addition we develop our mine plans based on maximizing the net present value from the ore bodies significant additional capital expenditures will be required at many of these mines in order to achieve the lifeofmine plans reflected below 

mill and leach stockpiles 

mill and leach stockpiles generally contain lower grade ores that have been extracted from an ore body and are available for copper recovery mill stockpiles contain sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through milling concentrating smelting and refining or alternatively by concentrate leaching leach stockpiles contain oxide ores and certain secondary sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities 

because it is generally impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count reasonable estimation methods are employed the quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grades of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles 

expected copper recovery rates for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing the recoverable copper in mill stockpiles once entered into the production process can be produced into copper concentrate almost immediately

expected copper recovery rates for leach stockpiles are determined using smallscale laboratory tests small to largescale column testing which simulates the productionscale process historical trends and other factors including mineralogy of the ore and rock type total copper recovery in leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low percentage to more than 90 percent depending on several variables including processing methodology processing variables mineralogy and particle size of the rock for newly placed material on active stockpiles as much as 80 percent of total copper recovery may be extracted during the first year and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years 

processes and recovery rates are monitored regularly and recovery rate estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes 

following are our stockpiles and the estimated recoverable copper contained within those stockpiles as of december 31 2014  

 

mineralized material 

we hold various properties containing mineralized material that we believe could be brought into production should market conditions warrant however permitting and significant capital expenditures would be required before operations could commence at these properties mineralized material is a mineralized body that has been delineated by appropriately spaced drilling andor underground sampling to support the reported tonnage and average metal grades such a deposit cannot qualify as recoverable proven and probable reserves until legal and economic feasibility are confirmed based upon a comprehensive evaluation of development costs unit costs grades recoveries and other material factors estimated mineralized materials as presented on the following page were assessed using prices of 220  per pound for copper 1000  per ounce for gold and 12  per pound for molybdenum

oil and gas operations 

as further discussed in note 2 during secondquarter 2013 we acquired oil and gas operations by completing the acquisitions of plains exploration  production company pxp and mcmoran exploration co mmr collectively fm og the portfolio of assets includes significant oil production facilities and growth potential in the deepwater gom established oil production onshore and offshore california large onshore natural gas resources in the haynesville shale play in louisiana natural gas production from the madden area in central wyoming and an industryleading position in the emerging inboard lower tertiarycretaceous natural gas trend located in the shallow waters of the gom and onshore in south louisiana approximately 90 percent of our oil and gas revenues are from oil and ngls 

in june 2014 fm og completed the sale of its eagle ford shale assets during 2014 fm og also acquired additional interests in the deepwater gom including interests in the lucius and heidelberg oil fields and several exploration leases in june 2014 and an interest in the vito oil discovery in the mississippi canyon area and a significant lease position in the vito basin in september 2014 refer to note 2 for further discussion of these transactions 

acreage 

at december 31 2014  we owned interests in oil and gas leases covering 50  million gross acres  29  million acres net to our interest the following table summarizes by geographic area the developed and undeveloped oil and gas acreage in which we held interests at december 31 2014  



approximately 35 percent  of our total us net undeveloped acres are covered by leases that expire from 2015 to 2017 as a result of the decrease in crude oil prices our current plans anticipate that the majority of expiring acreage will not be retained by drilling operations or other means 

the exploration permits covering our morocco acreage expire in 2016 however we have the ability to extend the exploration permits through 2019 

oil and gas properties 

our oil and gas properties are subject to customary royalty interests liens incident to operating agreements liens for current taxes and other burdens including other mineral encumbrances and restrictions we do not believe that any of these burdens materially interfere with our use of the properties in the operation of our business 

we believe that we have satisfactory title to or rights in all of our producing properties as is customary in the oil and gas industry we make minimal investigation of title at the time we acquire undeveloped properties we make title investigations and receive title opinions of local counsel only before we commence drilling operations we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our other assets although title to our properties is subject to encumbrances in certain cases we believe that none of these burdens will materially detract from the value of our properties or from our interest therein or will materially interfere with our use in the operation of our business

as further described in note 2 during 2014 fm og completed the acquisition of deepwater gom interests including interests in the heidelberg oil field and several exploration leases and in the vito oil discovery and a significant lease position in the vito area we have a 125 percent interest in heidelberg a large highquality oil development project located in 5300 feet of water in the green canyon area the heidelberg truss spar was designed as a luciuslookalike facility with capacity of 80 mbbls of oil per day development drilling is in progress and the project remains on track for first production in 2016 we have an 1867 percent interest in vito a large deep subsalt miocene oil discovery made in 2009 located in 4000 feet of water in the mississippi canyon area blocks 940 941 984 and 985 exploration and appraisal drilling in recent years confirmed a significant resource in highquality subsalt miocene sands development options are under evaluation 

our deepwater gom exploration portfolio includes interests in 169 blocks containing 70 prospects in the pliocene miocene and lower tertiary reservoirs 

gom shelf   our gom shelf properties are primarily located on the outer continental shelf in the shallow waters less than 500 feet of water of the gom and onshore in the gulf coast area of louisiana with drilling depths not exceeding 15000 feet considered to be traditional shelf prospects 

 39 

inboard lower tertiarycretaceous prospects with drilling depths below the salt weld generally at depths exceeding 25000 feet are considered inboard lower tertiarycretaceous prospects 

california  

onshore california  we hold a 100 percent working interest in the majority of our los angeles basin properties in the inglewood las cienegas montebello packard and san vicente fields and a 100 percent working interest in the majority of our san joaquin basin properties in the cymric midway sunset and south belridge fields the los angeles basin properties are characterized by light crude oil 21 to 32 degree american petroleum institute api gravity have well depths ranging from 2000 feet to over 10000 feet and include both primary production and mature wells using waterflood recovery methods whereby water is injected into the reservoir formation to displace residual oil where producing wells have a high ratio of water produced compared to total liquids produced high water cuts the san joaquin basin properties are longlived fields that have heavier oil 12 to 16 degree api gravity and shallow wells generally less than 2000 feet that require enhanced oil recovery techniques including steam injection and produce with high water cuts 

we also hold a 100 percent working interest in the arroyo grande field located in san luis obispo county which is a longlived field that has heavier oil 12 to 16 degree api gravity and well depths averaging 1700 feet requiring continuous steam injection 

offshore california all of our offshore california properties are located in federal waters approximately five to seven miles offshore in the santa maria basin we hold a 693 percent working interest in the point arguello unit composed of the hidalgo hermosa and harvest platforms and the various partnerships owning the related transportation processing and marketing infrastructure we also hold a 100 percent working interest in the point pedernales field which includes the irene platform that is utilized to access the federal outer continental shelf monterey reservoir by extended reach directional wells and support facilities which lie within the onshore lompoc field 

haynesville  the haynesville shale play is characterized by gas production from the jurassic aged haynesville shale formation in louisiana and typical well depth is 10500 feet the area has historically been developed with approximately 4000 foot horizontal wells at a measured total depth of 16000 feet 

madden  we own an approximate 14 percent working interest in the madden deep unit and lost cabin gas plant located in central wyoming the madden deep unit is a federal unit operated by a third party and consists of acreage in the wind river basin the madden area is characterized by gas production from multiple stratigraphic horizons of the lower fort union lance mesaverde and cody sands and the madison dolomite production from the madden deep unit is typically found at depths ranging from 5500 to 25000 feet 

exploration and development activities 

our oil and gas business has significant proved probable and possible reserves a broad range of development opportunities and highpotential exploration prospects the business is managed to reinvest its cash flows in projects with attractive rates of returns and risk profiles following the recent sharp decline in oil prices we have taken steps to significantly reduce capital spending plans and nearterm oil and gas growth initiatives in order to preserve cash flows and its resources for anticipated improved market conditions in the future we are also evaluating thirdparty participation in our oil and gas projects to provide additional funding 

fm og has a large strategic position in the deepwater gom with significant current oil production strong cash margins and existing infrastructure and facilities with excess capacity these assets combined with fm og’s large leasehold interests in an established geologic basin provide financially attractive investment opportunities for highimpact growth in oil production and cash margins fm og’s capital allocation strategy is principally focused on drilling and development opportunities that can be tied back to existing facilities 

capital expenditures for oil and gas operations totaled 32 billion  in 2014 and 145 billion  for the seven month period ending december 31 2013 capital expenditures for oil and gas operations for the year 2015 are currently estimated to total 23 billion  with approximately 80 percent of the 2015 capital budget expected to be directed to its highest return focus areas in the gom we are committed to achieving our objective of funding oil and gas capital expenditures with oil and gas cash flows thirdparty joint venture transactions or asset sales fm og is engaged in discussions to obtain funding from industry partners and other oil and gas market participants for a substantial portion of its 2015 capital expenditures to achieve this objective thirdparty funding could also enable fm og to complete additional development wells for production

oil and natural gas reserves 

our reserve volumes have been determined in accordance with the current regulations and guidelines established by the sec which require the use of an average price calculated as the twelvemonth average of the firstdayofthemonth historical reference price as adjusted for location and quality differentials unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements excluding escalations based upon future conditions and the impact of derivatives reference prices for reserve determination are the wti spot price for crude oil and the henry hub spot price for natural gas at december 31 2014  our estimates were based on reference prices of 9499  per barrel and 435  per mmbtu all of our oil and natural gas reserves are located in the us 

proved reserves all of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves at december 31 2014  are based upon reserve reports prepared by the independent petroleum engineering firms of netherland sewell  associates inc nsai and ryder scott company lp ryder scott the scope and results of procedures employed by nsai and ryder scott are summarized in letters that are filed as exhibits to this annual report on form 10k for purposes of reserve estimation we and our independent petroleum engineers used technical and economic data including well logs geologic maps seismic data well test data production data historical price and cost information and property ownership interests our reserves have been estimated using deterministic methods standard engineering and geoscience methods were used or a combination of methods including performance analysis volumetric analysis and analogy which we and our independent petroleum engineers considered to be appropriate and necessary to categorize and estimate reserves in accordance with sec definitions and regulations a substantial portion of these reserves are for undeveloped locations such reserves are based on estimates of reserve volumes and recovery efficiencies along with analogy to properties with similar geologic and reservoir characteristics because these estimates depend on many assumptions any or all of which may differ substantially from actual results reserve estimates may differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that we ultimately recover 

proved reserves represent quantities of oil and natural gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations the term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate at december 31 2014  our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves totaled 390  mmboe of which 74 percent  was comprised of oil including ngls 



a includes 10  mmbbls of ngl proved reserves consisting of 7  mmbbls of proved developed and 3  mmbbls of proved undeveloped 

at december 31 2014  we have an estimated total proved reserve life of 81 years and a proved developed reserve life of 51 years 

at december 31 2014  proved undeveloped reserves represented 37 percent  of our total proved reserves with the exception of one planned sidetrack development well in one of our deepwater gom properties that cannot be executed until the current producing well depletes 96 percent of our proved undeveloped reserves are scheduled 

 42 

for development within five years and 32 billion or 95 percent of our estimated future proved undeveloped capital is associated with the development of those reserves 

total estimated proved undeveloped reserves of 144 mmboe at december 31 2014 decreased by 13 mmboe from estimated proved undeveloped reserves of 157 mmboe at december 31 2013 during the year 2014 we invested 657 million and converted 25 mmboe from proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves in addition during the year 2014 we sold proved undeveloped reserves totaling 15 mmboe associated with the eagle ford properties partly offsetting the decreases in proved undeveloped reserves during the year 2014 were additions of 16 mmboe from the acquisition of interests in the deepwater gom including interests in the lucius and heidelberg oil fields and 9 mmboe through extensions and discoveries primarily associated with continued successful development in the deepwater gom at horn mountain we also had net upward revisions to proved undeveloped reserves totaling 2 mmboe primarily related to the improved gas price realizations in the haynesville shale play which was mostly offset by downward revisions resulting from deferred development plans as well as lower oil price realizations and higher steamrelated operating expenses resulting from higher natural gas prices for certain onshore california properties 

during the year ended december 31 2014  we participated in 50  gross exploratory wells of which 46 were successful and 261  gross development wells of which 259 were successful refer to drilling activities during this period proved reserve additions from extensions and discoveries totaled 16  mmboe 

the following table reflects the present value of estimated future net cash flows before income taxes from the production and sale of our estimated proved reserves reconciled to the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows standardized measure at december 31 2014  in millions 



a in accordance with sec guidelines estimates of future net cash flows from our proved reserves and the present value thereof are made using the twelvemonth average of the firstdayofthemonth historical reference prices as adjusted for location and quality differentials reference prices as of december 31 2014  were 9499  per barrel of oil and 435  per mmbtu of natural gas these prices are held constant throughout the life of the oil and gas properties except where such guidelines permit alternate treatment including the use of fixed and determinable contractual price escalations in accordance with the guidelines and excluding the impact of derivative instruments the average realized prices used in our reserve reports as of december 31 2014  were 9320  per barrel of oil and 435  per mcf of natural gas our reference prices are the wti spot price for crude oil and the henry hub spot price for natural gas 

b the present value of estimated future net cash flows before income taxes pv10 is not considered a us generally accepted accounting principle gaap financial measure we believe that our pv10 presentation is an important measure and useful to our investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves before taking into account the related future income taxes as such taxes may differ among companies because of differences in the amounts and timing of deductible basis net operating loss carryforwards and other factors we believe investors use our pv10 as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our proved reserves to the reserve estimates of other companies pv10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under us gaap and is not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves pv10 should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under us gaap 

refer to note 21 for further discussion of our proved reserves 

probable reserves all of our estimated probable oil and natural gas reserves at december 31 2014  are based upon reserve reports prepared by the independent petroleum engineering firms of nsai and ryder scott probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which together with proved reserves are as likely as not to be recovered in addition to the uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of proved reserves probable reserves may be assigned to areas where data control or interpretations of available data are less certain even if the interpreted reservoir continuity of structure or productivity does not meet the reasonably certain criterion probable reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir probable reserve estimates also include potential incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the 

 43 

hydrocarbons in place than assumed for proved reserves undeveloped reserves that meet the reasonably certain economic and other requirements to be classified as proved undeveloped except that they are not expected to be developed within five years are classified as probable reserves at december 31 2014  our estimated probable oil and natural gas reserves totaled 245  mmboe of which 81  percent was comprised of oil including ngls 



a includes 7  mmbbls of ngl probable reserves consisting of 2  mmbbls of probable developed and 5  mmbbls of probable undeveloped 

b reflects reserves associated with incremental recovery from existing productioninjection wells that require minimal to no future development costs and reserves associated with work performed on existing producersinjectors that do not meet the reasonable certainty requirements to be classified as proved reserves 

internal control and qualifications of third party engineers and internal staff  the technical personnel responsible for preparing the reserve estimates at nsai and ryder scott meet the requirements regarding qualifications independence objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers both nsai and ryder scott are independent firms of petroleum engineers geologists geophysicists and petrophysicists neither firm owns an interest in our properties nor are employed on a contingent fee basis our internal reservoir engineering staff are led and overseen by our vice president of engineering who has over 38 years of technical experience in petroleum engineering and reservoir evaluation and analysis this individual directs the activities of our internal reservoir staff for the internal reserve estimation process and also to provide the appropriate data to nsai and ryder scott for our yearend oil and natural gas reserves estimation process 

drilling activities 

the following table provides the total number of wells that we drilled during the year ended december 31 2014  and the seven month period ending december 31 2013  



 44 

in addition to the wells drilled during 2014 there were 43 gross exploratory and 38 gross development wells 11 net exploratory and 8 net development wells in progress at december 31 2014  including 59 gross wells 7 net wells in progress in the haynesville shale play 

in addition to the wells drilled during 2013 there were 36 gross exploratory and 60 gross development wells 23 net exploratory and 19 net development wells in progress at december 31 2013  including 50 gross wells 5 net wells in progress in the haynesville shale play and 36 gross wells 31 net wells in progress in the eagle ford shale play 

productive wells 

at december 31 2014  we had working interests in 3069 gross 2991 net active producing wells and 1710 gross 211 net active producing natural gas wells at december 31 2013  we had working interests in 3310 gross 3153 net active producing oil wells and 1651 gross 238 net active producing natural gas wells one or more completions in the same well bore are considered one well if any well in which one of the multiple completions is an oil completion such well is classified as an oil well at december 31 2014  and 2013 we owned interests in five gross wells containing multiple completions

we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements we caution readers that forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated projected or assumed in the forwardlooking statements important factors that can cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements include the following 

financial risks 

declines in the market prices of copper gold andor oil could adversely affect our earnings cash flows and asset values and if sustained could adversely affect our ability to repay debt fluctuations in the market prices of copper gold or oil can cause significant volatility in our financial performance and adversely affect the trading prices of our debt and common stock 

our financial results vary with fluctuations in the market prices of the commodities we produce primarily copper gold and oil and to a lesser extent molybdenum silver cobalt and natural gas for further information about the market prices of our primary commodities including the declines in copper and oil prices since mid2014 refer to the discussion below and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda a substantial or extended decline in the market prices of these commodities could have a material adverse effect on our financial results the value of our assets andor our ability to repay our debt and meet our other fixed obligations and could depress the trading prices of our common stock and of our publicly traded debt securities 

additionally if the market prices for the commodities we produce decline for a sustained period of time we may have to revise our operating plans including curtailing production halting or delaying expansion projects reducing operating costs and capital expenditures and discontinuing certain exploration and development programs we may be unable to decrease our costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues and may incur losses 

fluctuations in commodities prices can occur because of varied and complex factors beyond our control including global supply and demand balances and inventory levels of the commodities we sell global economic and political conditions government regulatory trade and tax policies commodities investment activity and speculation the price and availability of substitute products and changes in technology 

 45 

in particular copper prices may be affected by demand from china which has become the largest consumer of refined copper in the world and by changes in demand for industrial commercial and residential products containing copper factors particularly affecting gold prices may include the relative strength of the us dollar to other currencies inflation and interest rate expectations purchases and sales of gold by governments and central banks demand from china and india two of the world ’ s largest consumers of gold and demand for jewelry containing gold crude oil prices may be affected by continued development of shale reserves through hydraulic fracturing actions of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and other major oil producing nations political and weather conditions in oil producing regions transportation and refinery capacity the amount of foreign imports of oil into the us and potential changes in us laws restricting oil exports 

since the second half of 2014 oil prices have declined significantly after averaging 109 per barrel in the first half of 2014 brent crude oil prices averaged 90 per barrel for the second half of 2014 and declined to 5733  per barrel on december 31 2014 and were 6022  per barrel on february 20 2015  lower oil prices and to a lesser extent natural gas prices were a contributing factor to the 55 billion  of noncash impairment charges recorded for the year ended december 31 2014 to writedown the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and reduce the goodwill associated with our oil and gas operations to zero refer to notes 1 and 2 and mda for further discussion of these impairment charges sustained weaker oil and natural gas prices could result in additional impairments of our oil and gas properties 

copper prices have also declined during 2014 the london metal exchange lme spot copper prices ranged from a low of 286  per pound to a high of 338  per pound and averaged 311  per pound the lme spot copper price closed at 288  per pound on december 31 2014 and has declined to 259  per pound on february 20 2015 sustained lower copper prices could result in impairment of our longlived mining assets andor lower of cost or market inventory adjustments 

refer to note 1 and mda for further discussion of our accounting policies and estimates used in evaluating impairment of our longlived assets and our oil and gas properties 

our debt and other financial commitments may limit our financial and operating flexibility 

at december 31 2014  our total consolidated debt was  190 billion  see note 8 and our total consolidated cash was 464 million  we also have various other financial commitments including for reclamation and environmental obligations takeorpay contracts and leases our level of indebtedness and other financial commitments could have important consequences to our business including the following 

 

 

 

 

in addition a future downgrade in our credit rating could negatively affect our cost of and ability to access capital at february 20 2015 our senior unsecured debt was rated bbb with a stable outlook by standard and poor’s bbb with a stable outlook by fitch ratings and baa3 with a stable outlook by moody’s investors service we cannot be assured that our credit ratings will not be downgraded in the future in addition a downgrade could affect our requirements to provide significant financial assurance of our performance under certain legal requirements and contractual arrangements refer to the following risk factor for more information 

 46 

mine closure and reclamation regulations impose substantial costs on our operations and include requirements that we provide financial assurance supporting those obligations we also have plugging and abandonment obligations related to our oil and gas operations and are required to provide bonds or other forms of financial assurance in connection with those operations   changes in or the failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us 

we are required by us federal and state mining laws to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans if we are unable to do so the us environmental protection agency epa and state agencies may also seek financial assurance for investigation and remediation actions that are required under settlements of enforcement actions under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or equivalent state regulations 

with respect to our mining operations most of our financial assurance obligations are imposed by state laws that vary significantly by jurisdiction currently there are no financial assurance requirements for active mining operations under cercla but in 2009 the epa published a notice identifying classes of facilities within the hardrock mining industry for which the agency will develop financial responsibility requirements under cercla the epa has indicated that it intends to propose regulations regarding hardrock mining financial responsibility in august 2016 the epas schedule has been challenged by environmental groups which are petitioning the court to require the epa to finalize such regulations by january 2016 it is uncertain how the new requirements if promulgated will affect the amount and form of our existing and future financial assurance obligations 

we are also subject to financial assurance requirements in connection with our oil and gas operations under both state and federal laws for example permits bonding and insurance are required to drill operate and plug and abandon wells also the bureau of ocean energy management boem and the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement bsee regulations applicable to lessees in federal waters require that lessees have substantial us assets and net worth or post bonds or other acceptable financial assurance that the regulatory obligations will be met financial responsibility requirements are also required under the oil pollution act of 1990 to cover containment and cleanup costs resulting from an oil spill 

boem has signaled its intention to redesign and implement revised financial assurance requirements associated with offshore plugging and abandonment obligations boem has recently taken a stricter approach regarding the level of decommissioning liabilities to be included in its financial test for purposes of determining eligibility for exemption from financial assurance requirements it is uncertain whether additional changes will be implemented by the boem and how these changes might affect the form and amount of our existing and future financial assurance obligations associated with our offshore activities in federal waters 

as of december 31 2014  our financial assurance obligations associated with closure reclamation and remediation in our mining and plugging and abandonment obligations in our oil and gas operations totaled approximately 26 billion and a substantial portion of these obligations were satisfied by fcx and fm og guarantees and financial capability demonstrations if our financial condition were to deteriorate substantially or our credit rating were downgraded we may be required to provide additional or alternative forms of financial assurance such as letters of credit surety bonds or collateral these other forms of assurance would be costly to provide and depending on our financial condition and market conditions may be difficult or impossible to obtain failure to provide the required financial assurance could result in the closure of mines or suspension of the affected oil and gas operations 

refer to notes 1 and 12  for further discussion of our environmental and asset retirement obligations 

international risks 

our international operations are subject to political social and geographic risks of doing business in countries outside the us 

we are a usbased natural resource company with substantial mining assets located outside of the us we conduct international mining operations in indonesia peru chile and the democratic republic of congo drc our oil and gas operations are located in the us except that we expect to commence drilling at our first international oil and gas prospect offshore morocco in the first half of 2015 accordingly in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in countries outside the us our business may be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties in each of these countries risks of conducting business in countries outside of the us include 

 47 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our insurance does not cover most losses caused by the above described risks accordingly our exploration development and production activities outside of the us may be substantially affected by many unpredictable factors beyond our control some of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our international operations must comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption and antibribery laws of the other jurisdictions in which we operate there has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of these laws any violation of these laws could result in significant criminal or civil fines and penalties litigation and loss of operating licenses or permits and may damage our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are involved in several significant tax proceedings and other tax disputes with the indonesian and peruvian tax authorities refer to note 12  for further discussion of these matters other risks specific to certain countries in which we operate are discussed in more detail below 

because our grasberg minerals district is our most significant operating asset our business may continue to be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties and security risks in indonesia 

our mining operations in indonesia are conducted by our subsidiary pt freeport indonesia ptfi pursuant to a contract of work cow with the indonesian government maintaining a good working relationship with the indonesian government is important to us because of the significance of our indonesia operations to our business and because our mining operations there are among indonesias most significant business enterprises partially because of their significance to indonesias economy the environmentally sensitive area in which they are located and the number of people employed our indonesia operations have been the subject of political debates and of criticism in the indonesian press and have been the target of protests and occasional violence 

in 2009 indonesia enacted a mining law 2009 mining law which operates under a licensing system that is less protective of licensees than the contract of work system that governs ptfi the 2009 mining law and the regulations issued pursuant to that law provide that contracts of work would continue to be honored until their expiration however the regulations including those issued in january 2014 attempt to apply certain provisions of the 2009 mining law and regulations to existing contracts of work and seek to apply the licensing system to any extension periods of contracts of work 

in january 2012 the president of indonesia issued a decree calling for the creation of a team of ministers to evaluate contracts of work for adjustment to the 2009 mining law and to take steps to assess and determine the indonesian governments position on reduction to the size of contract concessions increasing government revenues and domestic processing of minerals 

 48 

ptfi has been engaged in discussions with officials of the indonesian government since 2012 regarding various provisions of its cow the indonesian government has sought to modify existing mining contracts including ptfi’s cow to address provisions of the 2009 mining law and subsequent regulations including with respect to the size of contract concessions government revenues domestic processing of minerals divestment provision of local services conversion from a cow to a licensing framework for extension periods and a requirement that extensions may be applied for only within two years prior to a cow’s expiration 

in january 2014 the indonesian government published regulations providing that holders of contracts of work with existing processing facilities in indonesia may continue to export product through january 12 2017 but established new requirements for the continued export of copper concentrates including the imposition of a progressive export duty on copper concentrates despite ptfi’s rights under its cow to export concentrates without the payment of duties ptfi was unable to obtain administrative approval for exports and operated at approximately half of its capacity from midjanuary 2014 through july 2014 

  

on july 25 2014 ptfi and the indonesian government entered into a memorandum of understanding mou under which ptfi and the government agreed to negotiate an amended cow to address provisions related to the size of ptfi’s concession area royalties and taxes domestic processing and refining divestment local content and continuation of operations post2021 execution of the mou enabled the resumption of concentrate exports which began in august 2014 the mou has been extended to july 25 2015 ptfi is engaged in active discussions with the indonesian government regarding an amended cow 

provisions being addressed in the negotiation of an amended cow include the development of new copper smelting and refining capacity in indonesia divestment to the indonesian government andor indonesian nationals of up to a 30 percent interest an additional 2064 percent interest in ptfi at fair value and timely granting rights for the continuation of operations from 2022 through 2041 negotiations are taking into consideration ptfi’s need for assurance of legal and fiscal terms post2021 for ptfi to continue with its largescale investment program for the development of its underground reserves 

effective with the signing of the mou ptfi provided a 115 million assurance bond to support its commitment for smelter development agreed to increase royalties to 40 percent for copper and 375 percent for gold from the previous rates of 35 percent for copper and 10 percent for gold and pay export duties as set forth in a new regulation the indonesian government revised its january 2014 regulations regarding export duties which are now set at 75 percent  declining to 50 percent  when smelter development progress exceeds 75 percent  and are eliminated when development progress exceeds 30 percent  

ptfi is advancing plans for the construction of new smelter capacity in parallel with completing of negotiations of its longterm operating rights and will also discuss the possibility of expanding industrial activities in papua in connection with its longterm development plans ptfi has identified a site adjacent to the existing pt smelting site in gresik indonesia for the construction of additional smelter capacity 

under the mou no terms of the cow other than those relating to the export duties smelter bond and royalties described above will be changed until the completion of an amended cow 

the revisions to the cow are expected to result in additional costs for our indonesian operations we cannot predict whether we will be successful in reaching a satisfactory agreement on the terms of our longterm mining rights if we are unable to reach agreement with the government on our longterm rights we may be required to reduce or defer investments in our underground development projects which would negatively impact future production and reserves in addition we are required to apply for renewal of export permits at sixmonth intervals and the next renewal date is july 25 2015 we cannot predict if such permits will be granted on a timely basis or whether we will be permitted to export concentrates after july 25 2015 

in january 2015 the indonesian government issued regulations that require letters of credit to be posted to secure export sales of goods which may impact ptfi and pt smelting such regulations are contrary to our cow but it is possible that the indonesian government may seek to impose such requirements on ptfi these requirements could result in additional costs as well as administrative complexities which could impact the ability to obtain customs clearance to export concentrates in a timely manner 

indonesia has also faced separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces several separatist groups have sought increased political independence for the province of papua where our grasberg minerals district is located in papua there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but 

 49 

highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the indonesian military in addition illegal miners have periodically clashed with police who have attempted for years to move them away from our facilities social economic and political instability in papua could materially and adversely affect us if it results in damage to our property or interruption of our indonesia operations 

since july 2009 there have been violent incidents in and around the grasberg minerals district including along the road leading to our mining and milling operations which have resulted in 20 fatalities and 59 injuries the safety of our workforce is a critical concern and ptfi continues to work with the indonesian government to address security issues the investigation of these incidents is ongoing we also continue to limit the use of the road leading to our mining and milling operations to secured convoys 

we cannot predict whether additional incidents will occur that could disrupt or suspend our indonesian operations if other disruptive incidents occur they could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in ways that we cannot predict at this time for further discussion of labor disruptions at ptfi refer to the operational risk factor labor unrest and activism could disrupt our operations and may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we will not mine all of our ore reserves in indonesia before the initial term of our cow expires 

the initial term of ptfis cow expires in 2021 but can be extended for two 10year periods subject to indonesian government approval which pursuant to the cow cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably our proven and probable ore reserves in indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041 and our current mine plan and planned operations are based on the assumption that we will receive the two 10year extensions as a result we will not mine all of these ore reserves during the initial term of the current cow prior to the end of 2021 we expect to mine 23 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable ore at december 31 2014  representing 30 percent of ptfis share of recoverable copper reserves and 40 percent of its share of recoverable gold reserves there can be no assurance that the indonesian government will approve our cow extensions for further discussion refer to the above risk factor because our grasberg minerals district is our most significant operating asset our business may continue to be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties and security risks in indonesia 

ptfis cow may be subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations and if a dispute arises we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of an international arbitration panel 

ptfis cow was entered into under indonesias 1967 foreign capital investment law which provides guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization the cow may be subject to termination by the indonesian government if we do not satisfy our contractual obligations which include the payment of royalties and taxes to the government and the satisfaction of certain mining environmental safety and health requirements 

certain indonesian laws and regulations may conflict with the mining rights established under the cow although the cow grants to ptfi the unencumbered right to operate in accordance with the cow government agencies may seek to impose additional restrictions on ptfi that could affect exploration and operating requirements for further discussion refer to the above risk factor because our grasberg minerals district is our most significant operating asset our business may continue to be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties and security risks in indonesia 

at times certain government officials and others in indonesia have questioned the validity of contracts entered into by the indonesian government prior to may 1998  ie  during the suharto regime which lasted over 30   years including ptfis cow which was signed in december 1991 we cannot provide assurance that the validity of or our compliance with the cow will not be challenged for political or other reasons 

ptfis cow requires that disputes with the indonesian government be submitted to international arbitration accordingly if a dispute arises under the cow we face the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of an international arbitration panel and if we prevail in such a dispute we will face the additional risk of having to enforce the judgment of an international arbitration panel against indonesia within its own territory additionally our operations may be adversely affected while resolution of a dispute is pending

the tenke fungurume tenke minerals district is located in the katanga province of the drc and may be adversely affected by security risks and political economic and social instability in the drc 

since gaining independence in 1960 the drc has undergone outbreaks of violence changes in national leadership and financial crises the drc held its first democratic elections in 2006 president joseph kabila elected in 2006 and currently serving his second term is not eligible under the drc constitution for reelection the next presidential election is scheduled to be held in 2016 these factors heighten the risk of abrupt changes in the national policy toward foreign investors which in turn could result in unilateral modification of concessions or contracts increased taxation denial of permits or permit renewals or expropriation of assets as part of a review of all mining contracts by the ministry of mines the ministry in the drc in february 2008 we received notification that the ministry wished to renegotiate several material provisions of tenke fungurume mining sas tfm mining contracts in october 2010 the drc government concluded its review of tfms existing mining contracts and confirmed that they are in good standing in connection with the review several amendments were made to tfm ’ s mining contracts and governing documents and in march 2012 fcxs effective ownership in tfm was reduced from 5775 percent to 56 percent 

political economic social and security risks in the drc are generally outside of our control and could adversely affect our business these risks include legal and regulatory uncertainties exposure to an environment of governmental corruption and bribery attempts to increase taxes or claims for fees and penalties by governmental officials including retroactive claims administrative disputes security risks resulting from political instability in the drc and risk of loss because of civil strife acts of war guerrilla activities insurrection and terrorism 

in addition to ongoing conflict in the eastern region of the drc there have been acts of violence in the katanga province where the tenke minerals district is located the safety of our workforce at all of our operations is our highest priority and tfm works cooperatively with government officials to address security issues however no assurance can be given that conflict or random acts of violence will not occur near or impact tenkes operations 

accordingly our tenke operations and future development activities at the tenke minerals district may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control any of which could interrupt tfm ’ s operations or future development activities and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

operational risks 

our mining and oil and gas operations are subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our business 

mines by their nature are subject to many operational risks some of which are outside of our control and many of which are not covered fully or in some cases even partially by insurance these operational risks which could adversely affect our business operating results and cash flow include earthquakes floods and other natural disasters equipment failures accidents wall failures and rock slides in our openpit mines and structural collapses in our underground mines and lower than expected ore grades or recovery rates 

managing the volume of waste rock leach material and tailings produced in our mining operations also presents significant environmental safety and engineering challenges and risks we maintain large leach pads and tailings impoundments containing viscous material which are effectively large dams that must be engineered constructed and monitored to assure structural stability and avoid leakages or structural collapse our tailings impoundments in arid areas must have effective programs to suppress fugitive dust emissions and we must effectively monitor and treat acid rock drainage in indonesia we use a river transport system for tailings management which presents other risks as discussed elsewhere in these risk factors the failure of the systems or structures used to successfully manage these risks could result in significant personal injury loss of life property damage and damage to the environment both in and around our areas of operations as well as damage to production facilities and delays in or curtailments of production 

our oil and gas operations are also subject to operating hazards including well blowouts cratering explosions fires uncontrollable flows of oil gas or well fluids and pipeline ruptures as well as natural disasters such as earthquakes mudslides and hurricanes our operations in california including transportation of oil by pipelines within the city and county of los angeles are especially susceptible to damage from earthquakes and involve increased risks of personal injury property damage and marketing interruptions because of the population density 

 51 

of southern california our operations in the gulf of mexico gom and gulf coast region are particularly susceptible to interruption and damage from hurricanes any of these operating hazards could cause personal injuries fatalities oil spills discharge of hazardous substances into the air soil water and groundwater and other property or environmental damage lost production and revenue remediation and cleanup costs and liability for damages all of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and may not be fully covered by our insurance 

labor unrest and activism could disrupt our operations and may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

as of december 31 2014 48 percent  of our global labor force was covered by collective bargaining agreements and 28 percent  of our global labor force was covered by agreements that will expire during 2015 including the agreement covering employees at our indonesia operations none of the employees of our oil and gas operations are represented by a union or covered by a collective labor agreement labor agreements are negotiated on a periodic basis and may not be renewed on reasonably satisfactory terms to us or at all if we do not successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements with our union workers we may incur prolonged strikes and other work stoppages at our mining operations which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations additionally if we enter into a new labor agreement with any union that significantly increases our labor costs relative to our competitors our ability to compete may be materially and adversely affected refer to items 1 and 2 business and properties for additional information regarding labor matters and expiration dates of such agreements 

we could also experience labor disruptions such as work stoppages work slowdowns union organizing campaigns strikes or lockouts which could adversely affect our operations for example our ptfi operations experienced an eightday work stoppage in july 2011 and an approximate threemonth strike that concluded in december 2011 the strike involved civil unrest transportation blockades sabotage of important operating facilities and violence operations were also temporarily suspended during firstquarter 2012 when ptfi experienced work interruptions in connection with its efforts to resume normal operations following the strike in october 2014 a large percentage of grasberg openpit operators did not report to their scheduled shifts notwithstanding approval of resumption of operations by indonesian authorities upon completion of their investigation of a fatal haul truck accident that occurred near the grasberg openpit significant reductions in productivity or protracted work stoppages at one or more of our operations could significantly reduce our production and sales volumes which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our mining production depends on the availability of sufficient water supplies 

our mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining ore processing and related support facilities most of our mining operations in north and south america are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant continuous production at our mines is dependent on our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies at our north america mining operations certain of our water supplies are supported by surface water rights which allow us to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location 

in arizona where our operations use both surface and ground water we are a participant in two active general stream adjudications in which the arizona courts have been attempting for over 40 years to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for two of the states largest river systems which affect four of our operating mines morenci safford sierrita and miami the legal precedent set in these proceedings may also affect our bagdad mine the adjudications are addressing the state law claims of thousands of competing users including us as well as very significant federally based water claims of us interests in arizona that are potentially adverse to the claims of surface water and groundwater users under state law groundwater is treated differently from surface water under arizona law which historically allowed land owners to pump at will subject to the doctrine of reasonable use however court decisions in one of the adjudications have concluded that groundwater pumping may affect surface water thereby effectively making it surface water and bringing the pumping within the jurisdiction of the general stream adjudications the effort to define the boundaries between groundwater and surface water remains contested and is currently a primary focus of one of those adjudications because groundwater accounts for approximately 40 percent of arizona ’ s water supplies the recharacterization of any significant portion of that water as surface water could jeopardize the ability of consumers farmers ranchers municipalities and industrial users like us to continue to access water supplies that have been relied on for decades because we are a significant user of both groundwater and surface water in arizona we are an active participant in the adjudication proceedings 

 52 

in colorado our surface water and groundwater rights are subject to adjudication and we are involved in legal proceedings to resolve disputes regarding priority and administration of rights including priority of some of our rights for the climax molybdenum mine in new mexico our surface water and groundwater rights are fully licensed or have been fully adjudicated 

water for our cerro verde operation in peru comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the rio chili watershed that collect water primarily from seasonal precipitation due to occasional drought conditions and the possibility that climate change will reduce precipitation levels temporary supply shortages are possible that could affect our current and planned cerro verde operations cerro verde has completed studies to assess opportunities for additional water supplies to support current operations and potential future expansion projects cerro verde has reached agreements with the regional government of arequipa the national government the local water utility servicio de agua potable y alcantarillado de arequipa sa sedapar and other local institutions to allow it to finance engineer and construct a wastewater treatment plant for the city of arequipa cerro verde has obtained authorization to reuse an annual average of one cubic meter per second of the treated water which is expected to supplement existing water supplies to support the concentrator expansion 

water for our el abra mining operation in chile comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascotán aquifer in 2010 el abra obtained regulatory approval subject to certain conditions for the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascotán aquifer for its sulfide processing plant which began operations in 2011 el abra has sufficient water rights and regulatory approvals to support current operations however a change to the sulfide ore project such as increased production or mill processing would require additional water beyond our allowable groundwater pumping which is permitted through 2021 el abra is conducting studies to assess the feasibility of constructing a desalination plant near the pacific ocean to treat seawater for possible increased sulfide ore production or mill processing 

although each of our mining operations currently has access to sufficient water supplies to support current operational demands some supplies are subject to unresolved claims by others and additional supplies that may be needed to support expanded operations are expensive in short supply and can be difficult to access because of logistical and legal obstacles moreover we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings on our water rights claims and uses loss of a water right loss of continued use of a currently available water supply or inability to expand our water resources could materially and adversely affect our mining operations by significantly increasing the cost of water forcing us to curtail operations preventing us from expanding operations or forcing premature closures thereby increasing andor accelerating costs or foregoing profitable operations 

in addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry our indonesia and africa mining operations involve additional risks because they are located in very remote areas and in indonesia unusually difficult terrain 

the grasberg minerals district is located in steep mountainous terrain in a remote area of indonesia these conditions have required us to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities in addition the area receives considerable rainfall which has led to periodic floods and mudslides the mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time our insurance may not sufficiently cover an unexpected natural or operating disaster 

underground mining operations can be particularly dangerous and in may 2013 a tragic accident which resulted in 28 fatalities and 10 injuries occurred at ptfi when the rock structure above the underground ceiling of a training facility collapsed ptfi temporarily suspended mining and processing activities at the grasberg complex to conduct inspections and resumed openpit mining and concentrating activities on june 24 2013 and underground operations on july 9 2013 in april 2011 two ptfi employees died in an accident when a portion of the doz underground mine experienced an uncontrolled muck flow no assurance can be given that similar events will not occur in the future 

the tenke minerals district is located in a remote area of the drc and is subject to challenges such as severely limited infrastructure including road bridge and rail access that is in disrepair and receives minimal maintenance limited and unreliable energy supply from antiquated equipment and from power distribution corridors that are not maintained difficulties in attracting and retaining experienced personnel security risks and limited health care in an area plagued by disease and other potential endemic health issues including malaria cholera and hiv 

 53 

additionally because of limited rail access we currently truck a significant portion of the production from the tenke mines approximately 1900 miles to ports in south africa the tenke minerals district and its future development may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control which could adversely affect their contribution to our operating results and increase the cost of future development 

we must continually replace reserves depleted by production but our exploration activities may not result in additional discoveries 

our existing mineral and oil and natural gas reserves will be depleted over time by production from our operations because our profits are derived from our mining and oil and gas operations our ability to replenish our reserves is essential to our longterm success our exploration projects involve many risks require substantial expenditures and may not result in the discovery of additional deposits or reservoirs that can be produced profitably we may not be able to discover enhance develop or acquire reserves in sufficient quantities to maintain or grow our current reserve levels which could negatively affect our business and prospects 

development projects are inherently risky and may require more capital than anticipated which could adversely affect our business 

there are many risks and uncertainties inherent in all development projects refer to mda for further discussion of our current development projects the economic feasibility of development projects is based on many factors including the accuracy of estimated reserves estimated capital and operating costs and estimated future prices of the relevant commodity the capital expenditures and time required to develop new mines wells or other projects are considerable and changes in costs or construction or drilling schedules can adversely affect project economics 

new development projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future cash flow the actual costs production rates and economic returns of our development projects may differ materially from our estimates which may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

operations in the deepwater gom present greater operating risks than operations in the shallower waters or onshore in addition our shallow water and onshore operations that target ultradeep prospects involve greater risks and costs than conventional gom shelf and onshore gulf coast prospects   

the deepwater gom presents significant challenges because of risks associated with geological complexity water depth and higher drilling and development costs for example in april 2010 the deepwater horizon an unaffiliated offshore drilling rig located in the deepwater gom sank following an explosion and fire resulting in fatalities and the discharge of substantial amounts of oil into the gom until midjuly 2010 when the flow of oil was finally stopped the us department of interior imposed a moratorium on deepwater drilling from may through october 2010 and also issued a series of rules and notices to lessees and operators imposing new and more stringent regulatory safety and performance requirements and permitting procedures for new wells to be drilled in the deepwater gom all of which significantly and adversely disrupted oil and gas exploration activities in the gom and resulted in increased costs 

the deepwater gom also lacks the infrastructure present in shallower waters which can result in significant delays in obtaining or maintaining production as a result deepwater operations may require significant time between a discovery and marketability thereby increasing the financial risk of these operations 

our inboard lower tertiarycretaceous exploration prospects target formations below the salt weld on the gom shelf and onshore in south louisiana these targets have not traditionally been the subject of exploratory activity in these regions so that little direct comparative data is available on february 25 2015 the highlander discovery located onshore in south louisiana in the inboard lower tertiarycretaceous trend began production prior to this date there had been no commercial production of hydrocarbons from inboard lower tertiarycretaceous reservoirs in these areas the lack of comparative data and the limitations of diagnostic tools operating in the extreme temperatures and pressures encountered at these depths make it difficult to predict reservoir quality and well performance of these formations it is also significantly more risky and expensive to drill and complete wells in these formations than at more conventional depths major contributors to such increased risks and costs include far higher temperatures and pressures encountered down hole longer drilling times extended procurement time and increased costs associated with the specialized equipment required to drill and complete wells in these formations 

 54 

our operations are subject to extensive regulations some of which require permits and other approvals these regulations increase our costs and in some circumstances may delay or suspend our operations 

our operations are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations that are subject to change and to changing interpretation by governmental agencies and other bodies vested with broad supervisory authority as a natural resource company compliance with environmental legal requirements is an integral and costly part of our business for additional information see environmental risks we are also subject to extensive regulation of worker health and safety including the requirements of the us occupational safety and health act and similar laws of other jurisdictions in the us the operation of our mines is subject to regulation by the us mine safety and health administration msha under the federal mine safety and health act of 1977 msha inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred if such inspections result in an alleged violation we may be subject to fines and penalties and in instances of alleged significant violations our mining operations could be subject to temporary or extended closures 

our oil and gas operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations that require among other things permits for the drilling and operation of wells and bonding and insurance to drill operate and plug and abandon wells and that regulate the safety of our pipelines our us offshore operations in federal waters are subject to broad regulation by the boembsee which among other things must issue permits in connection with our exploration drilling development and production plans under certain circumstances boembsee may impose penalties and may suspend or terminate any of our operations on federal leases many other governmental bodies regulate our operations and our failure to comply with these legal requirements can result in substantial penalties in addition new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations by courts or regulatory authorities occur regularly but are difficult to predict any such variations could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 

our business may be adversely affected by information technology disruptions 

cybersecurity incidents are increasing in frequency evolving in nature and include but are not limited to installation of malicious software unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data we have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past and may experience them in the future we believe we have implemented appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks however given the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of information technology disruptions we could be subject to manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

environmental risks 

our operations are subject to complex and evolving environmental laws and regulations compliance with environmental regulatory requirements involves significant costs and may constrain our expansion opportunities 

our operations both in the us and internationally are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing the generation transportation and disposal of hazardous substances waste disposal air emissions water discharges remediation restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination including oil spill cleanup mine closure and well plug and abandonment requirements protection of endangered and protected species and other related matters in addition we must obtain regulatory permits and approvals to start continue and expand operations laws such as cercla and similar state laws may subject us to joint and several liability for environmental damages caused by previous owners or operators of properties we acquired or are currently operating or at sites where we sent materials for processing recycling or disposal as discussed in more detail in the next risk factor we have substantial obligations for environmental remediation on mining properties previously owned or operated by freeport minerals corporation fmc and certain of its affiliates some of our onshore california oil and gas fields have been in operation for more than 100 years and current or future legal requirements may require substantial expenditures to remediate the properties or to otherwise comply with these requirements noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in material penalties or other liabilities in addition compliance with these laws may from time to time result in delays in or changes to our development or expansion plans compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs which we expect will continue to increase over time because of increased regulatory oversight adoption of increasingly stringent environmental standards as well as other factors 

 55 

new or revised environmental legal requirements are frequently proposed many of which result in substantially increased costs for our business for example the epa has recently promulgated rules that could result in the reclassification of some mineral processing materials as hazardous waste under the federal resource conservation and recovery act and subject the industry to significant new and costly waste management requirements we are seeking clarification of how those rules might affect our us copper and molybdenum processing and recycling activities 

other regulations under consideration by environmental regulatory agencies include provisions that would impose additional restrictions on waterway discharges and land use regulate environmental impacts of radioactive materials associated with mining operations and expand regulation of solid wastes among other things regulations are being considered at various governmental levels to increase regulation of or prohibit hydraulic fracturing adoption of these or similar new environmental regulations or more stringent application of existing regulations may materially increase our costs and constrain our expansion opportunities 

during 2014  we incurred environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs including our joint venture partners shares to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect our operations of 405 million  compared with 595 million  in 2013  and 612 million  in 2012  for 2015  we expect to incur approximately 500 million  of aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs the timing and amounts of estimated payments could change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements changes in scope and costs of reclamation and plug and abandonment activities the settlement of environmental matters and the rate at which actual spending occurs 

we incur significant costs for remediating environmental conditions on mining properties that have not been operated in many years 

fmc and its subsidiaries and many of their affiliates and predecessor companies have been involved in exploration mining milling smelting and manufacturing in the us for more than a century activities that occurred in the late 19th century and the 20th century prior to the advent of modern environmental laws were not subject to environmental regulation and were conducted before american industrial companies fully understood the longterm effects of their operations on the surrounding environment 

with the passage of cercla in 1980 companies like fmc became legally responsible for the remediation of hazardous substances released into the environment from properties owned or operated by them including damages to natural resources irrespective of when the damage to the environment occurred or who caused it that liability is often shared on a joint and several basis with all other prior and subsequent owners and operators meaning that each owner or operator of the property is fully responsible for the remediation although in many cases some or all of the other historical owners or operators no longer exist do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found as a result because of our acquisition of fmc in 2007 many of the subsidiary companies we now own are responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the us and we expect to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those remediation issues we are also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources at december 31 2014  we had more than 100  active remediation projects including damaged natural resource claims in 27  us states in addition fmc and certain affiliates and predecessor companies were parties to agreements relating to the transfer of businesses or properties which contained indemnification provisions relating to environmental matters and which from time to time become the source of claims against us 

at december 31 2014  we had 12 billion  recorded in our consolidated balance sheet for environmental obligations attributable to cercla or analogous state programs and for estimated future costs associated with environmental matters at closed facilities or closed portions of certain operating facilities our environmental obligation estimates are primarily based upon 

 

 

 56 

 

significant adjustments to these estimates are likely to occur in the future as additional information becomes available the actual environmental costs may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs and any such changes could be material 

in addition remediation standards for environmental media imposed by the epa and state environmental agencies have generally become more stringent over time and may become more stringent in the future imposition of more stringent remediation standards poses a risk that additional remediation work could be required at sites that we have already remediated to the satisfaction of the responsible governmental agencies and may increase the risk of toxic tort litigation 

refer to note 12  for further discussion of our environmental obligations 

our indonesia mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges and future changes in environmental laws or unanticipated environmental impacts from those operations could require us to incur increased costs 

mining operations on the scale of our indonesia operations involve significant environmental risks and challenges our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of crushed and ground rock material called tailings that results from the process by which we physically separate the copper gold and silverbearing materials from the ore that we mine our tailings management plan which has been approved by the indonesian government uses the unnavigable river system in the highlands near our mine to transport the tailings to an engineered area in the lowlands where the tailings and natural sediments are managed in a deposition area lateral levees have been constructed to help contain the footprint of the tailings and to limit their impact in the lowlands 

another major environmental challenge is managing overburden which is the rock that must be moved aside in the mining process to reach the ore in the presence of air water and naturally occurring bacteria some overburden can generate acid rock drainage or acidic water containing dissolved metals that if not properly managed can adversely affect the environment in addition overburden stockpiles are subject to erosion caused by the large amounts of rainfall with the eroded stockpile material eventually being deposited in the lowlands tailing management area this additional material while predicted in our environmental studies could influence the deposition of finer tailing material in the estuary 

from time to time certain indonesian government officials have raised questions with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans including a suggestion that we implement a pipeline system rather than the river transport system for tailings management and disposition because our indonesia mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area a pipeline system would be costly difficult to construct and maintain and more prone to catastrophic failure and could therefore involve significant potentially adverse environmental issues based on our own studies and others conducted by third parties we do not believe that a pipeline system is necessary or practical 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change issues may increase our costs and adversely   affect our operations 

many scientists believe that emissions from the combustion of carbonbased fuels contribute to greenhouse effects and therefore contribute to climate change carbonbased energy is a significant input in our operations and our revenues include significant sales of oil ngls and gas and other carbonbased energy products the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would vary by operation based on particular geographic circumstances a number of governments have introduced or are contemplating regulatory initiatives designed to control and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the us the epa has proposed regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions from new modified and existing power plants increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may increase our costs and may also affect the demand for the oil and gas we produce 

 57 

other risks 

our holding company structure may impact our ability to service debt and our stockholders ’  ability to receive dividends  

we are a holding company with no material assets other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries as a result our ability to repay our indebtedness and pay dividends is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend loan debt repayment or otherwise our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to make funds available to us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends dividends from subsidiaries that are not wholly owned are shared with other equity owners cash at our international operations is also subject to foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation into the us 

in addition our subsidiaries may not be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal restrictions as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries assets upon their liquidation reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries creditors including any trade creditors 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult these provisions 

 

 

 

 

 

these provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by the board 

in addition because we are incorporated in delaware we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with or acquisition of us 

these provisions may deter an acquisition of us that might otherwise be attractive to stockholders

we are involved in numerous legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business or are associated with environmental issues arising from legacy operations conducted over the years by freeport minerals corporation fmc and its affiliates we are also involved periodically in inquiries investigations and other proceedings initiated by or involving government agencies some of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief management does not believe based on currently available information that the outcome of any legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition although individual outcomes could be material to our operating results for a particular period depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period below is a discussion of our material water rights legal proceedings refer to note 12  for discussion of our other material legal proceedings 

water rights legal proceedings 

our operations in the western united states us require significant quantities of water for mining ore processing and related support facilities continuous operation of our mines is dependent on our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies in the arid western us water rights are often contested and disputes over water rights are generally timeconsuming expensive and not necessarily dispositive unless they resolve both actual and potential claims the loss of a water right loss of continued use of a currently available water supply or inability to expand our water resources could materially and adversely affect our mining operations by significantly increasing the cost of water forcing us to curtail operations preventing us from expanding operations or forcing premature closures thereby increasing andor accelerating costs and foregoing profitable operations 

at our north america operations certain of our water supplies are supported by surface water rights which give us the right to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location in arizona where our operations use both surface and groundwater we are a participant in two active general stream adjudications in which the arizona courts have been attempting for over 40 years to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for two of the states largest river systems which affect four of our operating mines morenci safford sierrita and miami the legal precedent set in these proceedings may also affect our bagdad mine the adjudications are addressing the state law claims of thousands of competing users including us as well as very significant federally based water claims of us interests in arizona that are potentially adverse to the claims of surface water and groundwater users under state law groundwater is treated differently from surface water under arizona law which historically allowed land owners to pump at will subject to the doctrine of reasonable use however court decisions in one of the adjudications have concluded that groundwater pumping may affect surface water thereby effectively making it surface water and bringing the pumping within the jurisdiction of the general stream adjudications the effort to define the boundaries between groundwater and surface water remains contested and is currently the principal focus of one of those adjudications because groundwater accounts for approximately 40 percent of arizonas water supplies the recharacterization of any significant portion of that water as surface water could jeopardize the ability of consumers farmers ranchers municipalities and industrial users like us to continue to access water supplies that have been relied on for decades additionally the adjudication court is currently addressing the quantification of several us federal water rights claims the legal precedent in these proceedings may affect the adjudication of federal water right claims near our arizona operations because we are a significant user of both groundwater and surface water in arizona we are an active participant in the adjudication proceedings 

in re the general adjudication of all rights to use water in the little colorado water system and sources  apache county superior court no 6417 filed on or about february 17 1978 the principal parties in addition to us include the state of arizona the salt river project the arizona public service company the navajo nation the hopi indian tribe the san juan southern paiute tribe and the us on behalf of those tribes on its own behalf and on behalf of the white mountain apache tribe this case involves adjudication of water rights claims including federal claims in the little colorado river watershed 

in re the general adjudication of all rights to use water in the gila river system and sources  maricopa county superior court cause nos w1 salt w2 verde w3 upper gila and w4 san pedro this case was originally initiated in 1974 with the filing of a petition with the arizona state land department and was consolidated and transferred to the maricopa county superior court in 1981 the principal parties in addition to us include the state of arizona the gila valley irrigation district the franklin irrigation district the san carlos irrigation and drainage district the salt river project the san carlos apache tribe the gila river indian community gric and the us on behalf of those tribes on its own behalf and on behalf of the white mountain apache tribe the

fort mcdowell mohaveapache indian community the salt river pimamaricopa indian community and the payson community of yavapai apache indians 

prior to january 1 1983 various indian tribes filed suits in the us district court in arizona claiming superior rights to water being used by many other water users including us and claiming damages for prior use in derogation of their allegedly superior rights these federal proceedings have been stayed pending the arizona superior court adjudications 

the maricopa county superior court issued a decision in 2005 in the gila river adjudication that directed the arizona department of water resources adwr to prepare detailed recommendations regarding the delineation of the “subflow” zone of the san pedro river basin a tributary of the gila river according to the court the subflow zone is the subsurface area adjacent to the river where the court may find that groundwater is connected to the surface water such that groundwater pumping may reduce surface flows in violation of rights of holders of surface water rights although we have minimal interests in the san pedro river basin a decision that recharacterizes groundwater in that basin as surface water may set a precedent for other river systems in arizona that could have material implications for many commercial industrial municipal and agricultural users of groundwater including our arizona operations 

adwr produced its recommendations in june 2009 which were objected to by numerous parties following a threeday hearing held in january 2012 the court directed adwr to submit a further report detailing the additional work it deemed necessary to properly delineate the san pedro river basin subflow zone on january 10 2013 the court issued an order instructing adwr to complete additional technical work and submit a new report adwr submitted its revised report on april 1 2014 and on october 1 2014 the parties submitted their comments to the revised report also on october 1 2014 as directed by the court adwr submitted a proposal for the next projects that adwr believes should be undertaken in the case among these next projects is the development of procedures for cone of depression analyses in the san pedro river watershed to determine whether a well located outside of the subflow zone creates a cone of depression that intersects the subflow zone and causes a 01 foot or greater drawdown in the subflow of the river based on the cone of depression analyses wells outside of the subflow zone could be determined by the court to be subject to the jurisdiction of the adjudication court which may require the owners of those wells to either demonstrate a valid surface water claim to support such pumping or potentially be subject to compliance or damages claims on november 6 2014 the court held a hearing to address the parties’ comments to adwr’s revised report and to discuss adwr’s proposal for next projects during that hearing adwr agreed to provide additional information to the parties by february 13 2015 to facilitate better evaluation of adwr’s methodologies and decisionmaking resulting in the revised report given the legal and technical complexity of this adjudication its long history and its longterm legal economic and political implications it is difficult to predict the timing or the outcome of this issue or of the overall adjudication if we are unable to satisfactorily resolve the issues being addressed in this adjudication our ability to pump groundwater could be diminished or curtailed and our operations at morenci safford sierrita miami and bagdad could be adversely affected 

as part of the gila river adjudication the us has asserted numerous claims for federal nonindian reserved surface water and groundwater rights throughout arizona these claims are based on reservations of federal land for specific purposes eg national parks military bases and wilderness areas unlike state lawbased water rights federal reserved water rights are not based on a history of beneficial use of specific amounts of water instead these rights are given priority in the prior appropriation system based on the date the land was reserved not the date that water was first used on the land as a result these federal water rights can be very disruptive to existing state lawbased water rights and uses particularly groundwater uses 

because federal reserved water rights have not been quantified the task of determining how much water each federal reservation may use has been left to the gila river adjudication court several “contested cases” to quantify reserved water rights for particular federal reservations are currently pending in the adjudication in multiple instances the us asserts a right to all water in a particular watershed that was not effectively appropriated under state law prior to the reservation this creates risks for both surface water users and groundwater users because such claims can severely impede current and future uses of water within the same watershed 

federal reserved rights present additional risks to water users aside from the significant quantities of water claimed by the us of particular significance federal reserved rights enjoy greater protection from groundwater pumping than is accorded to state lawbased water rights 

 60 

because there are numerous federal reservations in watersheds across arizona the reserved water right claims of the us pose a significant risk to multiple operations including morenci and safford in the upper gila river watershed sierrita in the santa cruz watershed and bagdad in the bill williams river watershed although the bill williams watershed is not part of the gila river adjudication decisions made in the gila river adjudication may be asserted as precedents for similar federal claims in the bill williams watershed because federal reserved water rights may adversely affect water uses at each of these operations we have been actively involved in litigation over these claims

copper gold molybdenum and oil 

following provides a brief discussion of our primary natural resources copper gold molybdenum and oil for further discussion of historical market prices of these metals refer to mda 

copper 

copper is an internationally traded commodity and its prices are determined by the major metals exchanges – the london metal exchange lme new york mercantile exchange nymex and shanghai futures exchange shfe prices on these exchanges generally reflect the worldwide balance of copper supply and demand and can be volatile and cyclical during 2013  lme spot copper prices ranged from a low of 301  per pound to a high of 374  per pound and averaged 331  per pound in general demand for copper reflects the rate of underlying world economic growth particularly in industrial production and construction according to wood mackenzie a widely followed independent metals market consultant copper’s enduse markets and their estimated shares of total consumption are

gold 

gold is used for jewelry coinage and bullion as well as various industrial and electronic applications gold can be readily sold on numerous markets throughout the world benchmark prices are generally based on london bullion market association london pm quotations during 2013  london pm gold prices ranged from a low of 1192  per ounce to a high of 1694  per ounce and averaged 1405  per ounce 

molybdenum 

molybdenum is a key alloying element in steel and the raw material for several chemicalgrade products used in catalysts lubrication smoke suppression corrosion inhibition and pigmentation molybdenum as a highpurity metal is also used in electronics such as flatpanel displays and in super alloys used in aerospace reference prices for molybdenum are available in several publications including metals week  ryan’s notes  and metal bulletin  during 2013  the weekly average price of molybdenum quoted by metals week  ranged from a low of 918  per pound to a high of 1195  per pound and averaged 1032  per pound 

oil 

oil products include transportation fuels fuel oils for heating and electricity generation asphalt and road oil and the feedstocks used to make chemicals plastics and synthetic materials the price of crude oil is set in the global marketplace with prices largely determined by regional benchmarks including brent west texas intermediate wti and light louisiana sweet lls prices generally reflect the worldwide supply and demand balance and can be volatile during 2013 the brent crude oil price ranged from a low of 9769  per barrel to a high of 11890  per barrel and averaged 10868  per barrel 

products and sales 

fcx’s consolidated revenues for 2013  primarily included sales of copper  69 percent  oil  11 percent  gold  8 percent  and molybdenum  5 percent  oil sales reflect sales for the sevenmonth period following the acquisition of our oil and gas operations refer to note 16  for a summary of our consolidated revenues and operating income by business segment and geographic area 

ptfis sales to pt smelting ptfis 25 percent owned copper smelter and refinery in indonesia  refer to mining operations  smelting facilities and other mining properties for further discussion represented 8 percent  of our consolidated revenues in 2013  and 11 percent  in 2012  and 2011  no other customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated revenues in any of the past three years 

copper products 

we are one of the world’s leading producers of copper concentrate cathode and continuous cast copper rod during 2013  49 percent  of our mined copper was sold in concentrate 28 percent  as cathode and 23 percent  as rod 

our copper ore is generally processed either by smelting and refining or by solution extraction and electrowinning sxew before being subject to the smelting and refining process ore is crushed and treated to produce a copper concentrate with copper content of approximately 20 to 30 percent copper concentrate is then smelted  ie  subjected to extreme heat to produce copper anodes which weigh between 800 and 900 pounds each and have an average copper content of 995 percent the anodes are further treated by electrolytic refining to produce copper cathodes which weigh between 100 and 350 pounds each and have an average copper content of 9999 percent for ore subject to the sxew process copper is extracted from the ore by dissolving it with a weak sulphuric acid solution the copper content of the solution is increased in two additional solutionextraction stages and then the copperbearing solution undergoes an electrowinning process to produce cathode that is on average 9999 percent copper our copper cathodes are used as the raw material input for copper rod brass mill products and for other uses 

copper concentrate  we produce copper concentrate at eight of our mines of which ptfi is our largest producer in north america copper concentrate is produced at our morenci bagdad sierrita and chino mines and is generally shipped to our miami smelter in arizona in south america we produce copper concentrate at our cerro verde candelaria and ojos del salado mines

copper cathode  we produce copper cathode at our electrolytic refinery located in el paso texas and at 10 of our mines in north america sxew cathode is produced from our morenci bagdad safford sierrita miami chino and tyrone mines in south america from our cerro verde and el abra mines and from the tenke minerals district in africa   atlantic copper slu atlantic copper our wholly owned copper smelting and refining unit in spain  refer to mining operations  smelting facilities and other mining properties for further discussion and pt smelting also produce copper cathode 

continuous cast copper rod  we manufacture continuous cast copper rod at our facilities in el paso texas norwich connecticut and miami arizona primarily using copper cathode produced at our north america copper mines 

copper sales 

north america  the majority of the copper produced at our north america copper mines and refined in our el paso texas refinery is consumed at our rod plants the remainder of our north america copper production is sold in the form of copper cathode or copper concentrate under us dollardenominated annual contracts cathode and rod contract prices are generally based on the prevailing commodity exchange inc comex  a division of nymex monthly average spot price for the month of shipment and include a premium generally copper rod is sold to wire and cable manufacturers while cathode is sold to rod brass or tube fabricators during 2013  four percent of our north america mines copper sales volumes were shipped to atlantic copper in the form of copper concentrate 

south america    production from our south america mines is sold as copper concentrate or copper cathode under us dollardenominated annual and multiyear contracts our south america mines generally sell approximately 60 to 70 percent of copper production in concentrate and the rest as cathode during 2013  12 percent of our south america mines copper sales volumes were shipped to atlantic copper in the form of copper concentrate 

substantially all of south america’s copper concentrate and cathode sales contracts provide final copper pricing in a specified future month generally one to four months from the shipment date primarily based on quoted lme monthly average spot copper prices revenues from south america’s concentrate sales are recorded net of treatment and refining charges  ie  fees paid to smelters and refiners that are generally negotiated annually including any applicable price participation charges that are based on the market price of copper in addition because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrates is unrecoverable from the smelting process revenues from south america’s concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances for unrecoverable metals which are a negotiated term of the contracts and vary by customer 

indonesia    ptfi sells its production in the form of copper concentrate which contains significant quantities of gold and silver under us dollardenominated longterm contracts ptfi also sells a small amount of copper concentrates in the spot market following is a summary of ptfi’s aggregate percentage concentrate sales to pt smelting atlantic copper and third parties for the last three years 



substantially all of ptfi’s concentrate sales contracts provide final copper pricing in a specified future month generally one to four months from the shipment date primarily based on quoted lme monthly average spot copper prices revenues from ptfi’s concentrate sales are recorded net of royalties treatment and refining charges and allowances for unrecoverable metals 

africa  tfm sells its production in the form of copper cathode under us dollardenominated contracts substantially all of tfms cathode sales provide final copper pricing in the month after the shipment date based on quoted lme monthly average spot copper prices revenues from tfms cathode sales are recorded net of royalties and also include adjustments for pointofsale transportation costs that are negotiated in customer contracts 

gold products and sales 

we produce gold mostly from the grasberg minerals district gold is primarily sold as a component of our copper concentrate or in slimes which are a product of the smelting and refining process gold generally is priced at the average london price for a specified month near the month of shipment revenues from gold sold as a component 

 5 

of our copper concentrate are recorded net of treatment and refining charges revenues from gold sold in slimes are recorded net of refining charges

ptfi’s original cow was entered into in 1967 and was replaced by a new cow in 1991 the initial term of the current cow expires in 2021 but can be extended for two 10year periods subject to indonesian government approval which pursuant to the cow cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably the cow allows us to conduct exploration mining and production activities in the 24700acre block a area which is where all of ptfi’s proven and probable mineral reserves and current mining operations are located under the cow ptfi also conducts exploration activities in the block b area we expect the block b area to be reduced to approximately 413000 acres once the department of energy and mineral resources demr formally accepts ptfis relinquishment of approximately 89000 acres and further relinquishments may result from the cow evaluation process discussed in note 13  

 18 

ptfi pays royalties on copper gold and silver under its cow and has agreed to pay additional royalties to the indonesian government that are not required under its cow the additional royalties provide further support to the local governments and to the people of the indonesian province of papua ptfi’s share of the combined royalties totaled 109 million  in 2013  93 million  in 2012  and 137 million  in 2011  

under a joint venture agreement through ptnbm we were allowed to conduct exploration activities under a separate cow on three parcels contiguous to ptfi’s block b and one of eastern minerals’ blocks since 2011 we have made a number of requests of the demr including suspension of activities for the cow while awaiting receipt of permits from the indonesian governments department of forestry that would allow us to resume exploration activities in september 2013 we received notification from the demr advising us to lodge a completed feasibility study within 30 days and enter into the construction period within the cow timeline however since we had not completed our exploration program we were unable to comply the letter was in effect a denial of our previously unanswered requests resulting in a decision to terminate the cow we have initiated actions required under the cow that will result in its formal termination 

eastern minerals is allowed to conduct exploration in papua through a joint venture agreement under a separate cow the situation with the eastern minerals cow is similar to that of ptnbm and we expect to receive a similar response from the demr because of this expected outcome we have notified the demr of our intentions to terminate the cow and have initiated the formal termination process 

in 2009 indonesia enacted a mining law 2009 mining law which operates under a licensing system that is significantly less protective of licensees than the contract of work system that governs ptfi eastern minerals and ptnbm the 2009 mining law and the regulations issued pursuant to that law provide that contracts of work would continue to be honored until their expiration however the regulations including those issued in january 2014 attempt to apply certain provisions of the 2009 mining law and regulations to existing contracts of work and seek to apply the licensing system to any extension periods of contracts of work 

in january 2012 the president of indonesia issued a decree calling for the creation of a team of ministers to evaluate contracts of work for adjustment to the 2009 mining law and to take steps to assess and determine the indonesian governments position on reduction to the size of contract concessions increasing government revenues and domestic processing of minerals we have been engaged in discussions with officials of the indonesian government to complete this evaluation process and obtain an extension of the ptfi cow beyond its primary term ending in 2021 to 2041 as provided under the terms of the cow which can only be modified by mutual agreement between ptfi and the indonesian government refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion 

in january 2014 the indonesian government published regulations providing that holders of contracts of work with existing processing facilities in indonesia may continue to export product through january 12 2017 but established new requirements for the continued export of copper concentrates including the imposition of a progressive export duty on copper concentrates in the amount of 25 percent in 2014 rising to 60 percent by mid2016 ptfi’s cow authorizes it to export concentrates and specifies the taxes and other fiscal terms available to its operations the cow states that ptfi shall not be subject to taxes duties or fees subsequently imposed or approved by the indonesian government except as expressly provided in the cow additionally ptfi complied with the requirements of its cow for local processing by arranging for the construction and commissioning of indonesias only copper smelter and refinery which is owned and operated by pt smelting refer to smelting facilities and other mining properties 

the january 2014 regulations conflict with ptfi’s contractual rights under its cow we are working with the indonesian government to clarify the situation and to defend ptfis rights under its cow ptfi is also seeking to obtain the required administrative permits for 2014 exports which have been delayed as a result of the new regulations 

as of february 21 2014 ptfi has not obtained administrative approval for 2014 exports ptfi has implemented nearterm changes to its operations to coordinate its concentrate production with pt smelting’s operating plans since midjanuary 2014 ptfi’s milling rate has averaged approximately 112000 metric tons of ore per day which is approximately half of normal rates ptfi is engaging with the government of indonesia to reach a resolution that would enable ptfi to resume normal operations as soon as possible in the event that ptfi is unable to resume normal operations for an extended period we plan to consider further actions including constraining operating 

 19 

costs deferring capital expenditures and implementing workforce reductions ptfi may also be required to declare force majeure under its concentrate sales agreements 

grasberg minerals district  ptfi operates in the remote highlands of the sudirman mountain range in the province of papua indonesia which is on the western half of the island of new guinea we and our predecessors have been the only operator of exploration and mining activities in block a since 1967 

the grasberg minerals district has three operating mines the grasberg open pit the deep ore zone doz underground mine and the big gossan underground mine we also have several projects in progress in the grasberg minerals district related to the development of the largescale longlived highgrade underground ore bodies located beneath and nearby the grasberg open pit in aggregate these underground ore bodies are expected to ramp up over several years to produce approximately 240000 metric tons of ore per day following the transition from the grasberg open pit currently anticipated to occur in 2017 refer to “mining development projects and exploration” for further discussion 

ptfi’s production including our joint venture partner’s share totaled 928 million  pounds of copper and 114 million  ounces of gold in 2013  695 million  pounds of copper and 862 thousand  ounces of gold in 2012  and 882 million  pounds of copper and 144 million  ounces of gold in 2011  

our principal source of power for all our indonesian operations is a coalfired power plant that we built in 1998 diesel generators supply peaking and backup electrical power generating capacity a combination of naturally occurring mountain streams and water derived from our underground operations provides water for our operations our indonesian operations are in an active seismic zone and experience average annual rainfall of approximately 200 inches 

grasberg open pit 

we began openpit mining of the grasberg ore body in 1990 with mining operations expected to continue through early 2017 production in the open pit is currently at the 3190 to 3940 meter elevation level and totaled 46 million metric tons of ore in 2013  which provided 71 percent of ptfis 2013  mill feed 

the current openpit equipment fleet consists of over 500 units the larger mining equipment directly associated with production includes an available fleet of 157 haul trucks with payloads ranging from 218 to 330 metric tons and 16 shovels with bucket sizes ranging from 30 to 42 cubic meters which mined an average of 381000 metric tons of material per day during 2013  399000 metric tons per day in 2012  and 486000 metric tons per day in 2011  

grasberg crushing and conveying systems are integral to the mine and provide the capacity to transport up to 250000 metric tons per day of grasberg ore to the mill and 150000 metric tons per day of overburden to the overburden stockpiles the remaining overburden is moved by haul trucks 

doz underground mine 

the doz ore body lies vertically below the now depleted intermediate ore zone we began production from the doz ore body in 1989 using open stope mining methods but suspended production in 1991 in favor of production from the grasberg open pit production resumed in september 2000 using the blockcave method and is at the 3110meter elevation level production from the doz mine averaged 49400  metric tons of ore per day for the year 2013  and is expected to ramp up to the design rate of 80000 metric tons of ore per day during 2014 pending approval of export permits as described above production at the doz mine is expected to continue through 2019 

the doz mine fleet consists of over 200 pieces of mobile heavy equipment which is capable of mining an average of 80000 metric tons of material per day the primary mining equipment directly associated with production and development includes an available fleet of 44 lhd units and 20 haul trucks each production lhd unit typically carries approximately 11 metric tons of ore using ore passes and chutes the lhd units transfer ore into 55metric ton capacity haul trucks the trucks dump into two gyratory crushers and the ore is then conveyed to the surface stockpiles for processing 

the success of the development of the doz mine one of the world’s largest underground mines provides confidence in the future development of ptfi’s largescale undeveloped underground ore bodies 

 20 

big gossan underground mine 

the big gossan mine lies underground and adjacent to the current mill site it is a tabular near vertical ore body with approximate dimensions of 1200 meters along strike and 800 meters down dip with varying thicknesses from 20 meters to 120 meters the mine utilizes a blasthole stoping method with delayed paste backfill stopes of varying sizes are mined and the ore dropped down passes to a truck haulage level trucks are chute loaded and transport the ore to a jaw crusher the crushed ore is then hoisted vertically via a twoskip production shaft to a level where it is loaded onto a conveyor belt the belt carries the ore to one of the main underground conveyors where the ore is transferred and conveyed to the surface stockpiles for processing 

the big gossan underground mine averaged 2100  metric tons of ore per day for the year 2013  and is expected to ramp up to 7000 metric tons of ore per day by 2016 although development activities continue production from the big gossan underground mine is currently suspended pending resolution of the export regulatory matter discussed above 

the big gossan underground mine fleet consists of over 70 pieces of mobile heavy equipment which includes 11 loaders and eight trucks used in development and production activities 

description of ore bodies   our indonesia ore bodies are located within and around two main igneous intrusions the grasberg monzodiorite and the ertsberg diorite the host rocks of these ore bodies include both carbonate and clastic rocks that form the ridge crests and upper flanks of the sudirman range and the igneous rocks of monzonitic to dioritic composition that intrude them the igneoushosted ore bodies the grasberg open pit and block cave and portions of the doz block cave occur as vein stockworks and disseminations of copper sulfides dominated by chalcopyrite and to a lesser extent bornite the sedimentaryrock hosted ore bodies portions of the doz and all of the big gossan occur as “magnetiterich calciummagnesian skarn” replacements whose location and orientation are strongly influenced by major faults and by the chemistry of the carbonate rocks along the margins of the intrusions 

the copper mineralization in these skarn deposits is dominated by chalcopyrite but higher bornite concentrations are common moreover gold occurs in significant concentrations in all of the district’s ore bodies though rarely visible to the naked eye these gold concentrations usually occur as inclusions within the copper sulfide minerals though in some deposits these concentrations can also be strongly associated with pyrite 

the following diagram indicates the relative elevations in meters of our reported ore bodies

tfm is organized under the laws of the drc we own an effective 56 percent interest in tfm with the remaining ownership interests held by lundin mining corporation lundin an effective 24 percent interest and la générale des carrières et des mines gécamines which is wholly owned by the drc government a 20 percent nondilutable interest 

tfm is entitled to mine in the drc under an amended and restated mining convention armc with the drc government the original mining convention was entered into in 1996 and was replaced with the armc in 2005 which was further amended in 2010 approved in 2011 the current armc will remain in effect for as long as the tenke concessions are exploitable 

tfm pays a royalty of two percent of net revenues under the armc which totaled 29 million  in 2013  25 million  in 2012  and 24 million  in 2011  

 22 

the tenke minerals district is located in the katanga province of the drc approximately 110 miles northwest of lubumbashi and is accessible by paved roads and by rail the deposits are sedimenthosted copper and cobalt deposits with oxide mixed oxidesulfide and sulfide mineralization the dominant oxide minerals are malachite pseudomalachite and heterogenite important sulfide minerals consist of bornite carrollite chalcocite and chalcopyrite 

initial copper production commenced at the tenke minerals district in march 2009 tfm completed its second phase expansion project in early 2013 which included optimizing the current plant and increasing mine mill and processing capacity the expanded mill facility throughput rates averaged 14900 metric tons of ore per day during 2013 compared with original design capacity of 14000 metric tons of ore per day enabling an increase in tenkes copper production to over 430 million pounds per year the addition of a second sulphuric acid plant is expected to be completed in 2016 

we continue to engage in exploration activities and metallurgical testing to evaluate the potential of the highly prospective tenke minerals district these analyses are being incorporated into future plans for potential expansions of production capacity future expansions are subject to a number of factors including economic and market conditions and the business and investment climate in the drc 

the current equipment fleet includes one 10cubic meter mass excavator three 17cubic meter mass excavators three 12cubic meter frontend loaders ten 7cubic meter frontend loaders thirtytwo 91metric ton haul trucks and eleven 45metric ton haul trucks 

copper and cobalt are recovered through an agitationleach plant production from the tenke minerals district totaled 462 million  pounds of copper and 28 million  pounds of cobalt in 2013  348 million  pounds of copper and 26 million  pounds of cobalt in 2012  and 281 million  pounds of copper and 25 million  pounds of cobalt in 2011  

the tenke minerals district is located in a tropical region however temperatures are moderated by its higher altitudes weather in this region is characterized by a dry season and a wet season each lasting about six months with average rainfall of 47 inches per year the highest bench elevation is expected to be 1518 meters above sea level and the ultimate pit bottom is expected to be 1110 meters above sea level the tenke deposits are covered by six exploitation permits totaling approximately 394450 acres 

tfm has longterm power supply and infrastructure funding agreements with la société nationale d’electricité the stateowned electric utility company serving the region the results of a recent water exploration program as well as the regional geological and hydrogeological conditions indicate that adequate water is available during the expected life of the operation 

smelting facilities and other mining properties 

atlantic copper  our wholly owned atlantic copper smelter and refinery is located on land concessions from the huelva spain port authorities which are scheduled to expire in 2027 

the design capacity of the smelter is approximately 300000 metric tons of copper per year and the refinery currently has a capacity of 285000 metric tons of copper per year during 2013  atlantic copper treated approximately 869400 million metric tons of concentrate and scrap and produced 224300 metric tons of copper anodes from its smelter and 226000 metric tons of copper cathodes from its refinery following is a summary of atlantic coppers concentrate purchases from our copper mining operations and third parties for the last three years 



during 2013 atlantic copper successfully completed a scheduled 68day major maintenance turnaround atlantic coppers major maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately every eight years with shortterm maintenance turnarounds in the interim the next shortterm maintenance turnaround is scheduled for the second half of 2015 

 23 

pt smelting  ptfi’s cow required us to construct or cause to be constructed a smelter in indonesia if we and the indonesian government determined that such a project would be economically viable in 1995 following the completion of a feasibility study we entered into agreements relating to the formation of pt smelting an indonesian company and the construction of the copper smelter and refinery in gresik indonesia pt smelting owns and operates the smelter and refinery ptfi mitsubishi materials corporation mitsubishi corporation unimetals ltd and jx nippon mining  metals corporation own 25 percent 605 percent 95 percent and 5 percent respectively of the outstanding pt smelting common stock 

ptfi’s contract with pt smelting provides for the supply of 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements subject to a minimum or maximum rate necessary for pt smelting to produce 205000 metric tons of copper annually on a priority basis ptfi also sells copper concentrate to pt smelting at market rates for quantities in excess of 205000 metric tons of copper annually 

during 2013  pt smelting treated 967800 metric tons of concentrate and produced 217700 metric tons of copper anodes from its smelter and 214300 metric tons of copper cathodes from its refinery 

pt smeltings maintenance turnarounds which range from two weeks to a month to complete typically are expected to occur approximately every two years with shortterm maintenance turnarounds in the interim pt smelting completed an 18day maintenance turnaround during firstquarter 2014 and the next major maintenance turnaround is scheduled for 2016 

miami smelter  we own and operate a smelter at our miami arizona mining operation the smelter has been operating for approximately 100 years and has been upgraded numerous times during that period to implement new technologies to improve production and to comply with air quality requirements as a result of new air quality standards for sulfur dioxide emissions the miami smelter is required to install pollution control equipment as part of an expansion that will allow the smelter to operate and comply with the new standard refer to item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

the miami smelter processes copper concentrate primarily from our arizona copper mines concentrate processed through the smelter totaled approximately 629000 metric tons in 2013  in addition because sulphuric acid is a byproduct of smelting concentrates the miami smelter is also the most significant source of sulphuric acid for our north america leaching operations 

major maintenance turnarounds which take approximately three weeks to complete typically occur approximately every 14 months for the miami smelter with shorter term maintenance turnarounds in the interim 

rod  refining operations  our rod  refining operations consist of conversion facilities located in north america including a refinery in el paso texas rod mills in el paso texas norwich connecticut and miami arizona and a specialty copper products facility in bayway new jersey we refine our copper anode production from our miami smelter at our el paso refinery the el paso refinery has the potential to operate at an annual production capacity of about 900 million pounds of copper cathode which is sufficient to refine all of the copper anode we produce at miami our el paso refinery also produces nickel carbonate copper telluride and autoclaved slimes material containing gold silver platinum and palladium 

molybdenum conversion facilities  we process molybdenum concentrates at our conversion plants in the us and europe into such products as technicalgrade molybdic oxide ferromolybdenum pure molybdic oxide ammonium molybdates and molybdenum disulfide we operate molybdenum roasters in sierrita arizona fort madison iowa and rotterdam the netherlands and we operate a molybdenum pressure leach plant in bagdad arizona we also produce ferromolybdenum for customers worldwide at our conversion plant located in stowmarket united kingdom 

freeport cobalt  on march 29 2013 we through a newly formed consolidated joint venture completed the acquisition of a cobalt chemical refinery in kokkola finland and the related sales and marketing business the acquisition provides direct endmarket access for the cobalt hydroxide production at the tenke minerals district the joint venture operates under the name freeport cobalt and we are the operator with an effective 56 percent ownership interest the remaining effective ownership interest is held by our partners in tfm including 24 percent by lundin and 20 percent by gécamines the kokkola refinery has an annual refining capacity of approximately 12000 metric tons of cobalt sufficient to refine the majority of the cobalt we produce in the tenke minerals district 

 24 

other north america copper mines  in addition to our operating mines we have four nonoperating copper mines in north america – ajo bisbee and tohono in arizona and cobre in new mexico – that have been on careandmaintenance status for several years and would require new or updated environmental studies new permits and additional capital investment which could be significant to return them to operating status 

in december 2009 we purchased the twin buttes copper mine which ceased operations in 1994 and is adjacent to our sierrita mine in arizona the purchase provides significant synergies in the sierrita minerals district including the potential for expanded mining activities and access to material that can be used for sierrita tailings and stockpile reclamation purposes we have completed drilling on the property and metallurgical studies to support a future feasibility study 

mining development projects and exploration 

we have several projects and potential opportunities to expand production volumes extend mine lives and develop largescale underground ore bodies our nearterm major development projects which will require substantial additional capital investment are presented below also refer to mda for further discussion of these projects our other development projects and exploration activities 

considering the longterm nature and large size of our development projects actual costs and timing could vary from estimates we continue to review our mine development and processing plans to maximize the value of our mineral reserves 

morenci  we are expanding mining and milling capacity at morenci to process additional sulfide ores identified through exploratory drilling the project is targeting incremental annual production of approximately 225 million pounds of copper beginning in 2014 an approximate 40 percent increase from 2013 through an increase in milling rates from 50000 metric tons of ore per day to approximately 115000 metric tons of ore per day at full rates morencis copper production is expected to approach 1 billion pounds in 2015 compared with 564 million pounds in 2013 at december 31 2013 construction is more than 60 percent complete and the project is on track for first copper production in the first half of 2014 

cerro verde  construction activities associated with a largescale expansion at cerro verde are in progress at december 31 2013 engineering was more than 90 percent complete and construction progress is advancing on schedule the project is expected to expand the concentrator facilities from 120000 metric tons of ore per day to 360000 metric tons of ore per day and provide incremental annual production of approximately 600 million pounds of copper and 15 million pounds of molybdenum beginning in 2016 in addition construction activities are progressing on a wastewater treatment plant for the city of arequipa which will be used to supplement existing water supplies to support the concentrator expansion 

el abra  we continue to evaluate a potential largescale milling operation at el abra to process additional sulfide material and to achieve higher recoveries exploration results in recent years at el abra indicate a significant sulfide resource which could potentially support a major mill project 

grasberg  we have several projects in progress in the grasberg minerals district related to the development of largescale longlived highgrade underground ore bodies in aggregate these underground ore bodies are expected to ramp up over several years to produce approximately 240000 metric tons of ore per day following the transition from the grasberg open pit currently anticipated to occur in 2017 development of the grasberg block cave and deep mill level zone dmlz mines is advancing to enable dmlz to commence production in 2015 and the grasberg block cave mine to commence production in 2017 

in addition to the nearterm development projects in progress in the grasberg minerals district we also have an additional longterm underground mine development project in the grasberg minerals district for the kucing liar ore body which lies on the southern flank of and underneath the southern portion of the grasberg open pit at the 2605meter elevation level we expect to mine the kucing liar ore body using the blockcave method aggregate capital cost estimates for development of the kucing liar ore body are projected to approximate 2 billion which are expected to be made between 2019 and 2032 additionally our current mine development plans include approximately 3 billion of capital expenditures at our processing facilities to optimize the handling of underground ore types once the grasberg openpit operations cease we expect substantially all of these expenditures to be m ade between 2016 and 2034

sources and availability of energy natural resources and raw materials 

our copper mining operations require significant energy principally diesel electricity coal and natural gas most of which is obtained from third parties under longterm contracts energy represented approximately 20 percent  of our 2013  consolidated copper production costs and included purchases of approximately 260 million  gallons of diesel fuel 7200  gigawatt hours of electricity at our north america south america and africa copper mining operations we generate all of our power at our indonesia mining operation 705 thousand  metric tons of coal for our coal power plant in indonesia and 1  mmbtu million british thermal units of natural gas at certain of our north america mines for 2014  we estimate energy will approximate 21 percent  of our consolidated copper production costs 

our mining operations also require significant quantities of water for mining ore processing and related support facilities although we believe our mining operations have sufficient water rights the loss of water rights for any of our mines in whole or in part or shortages of water to which we have rights could require us to curtail or shut down mining operations for a further discussion of risks and legal proceedings associated with the availability of water refer to item 1a “risk factors” and item 3 “legal proceedings” 

sulphuric acid is used in the sxew process and is produced as a byproduct of the smelting process at our smelters and from our sulphur burners at the safford and tenke mines sulphuric acid needs in excess of the sulphuric acid produced by our operations are purchased from third parties 

community and human rights 

we have adopted policies that govern our working relationships with the communities where we operate and are designed to guide our practices and programs in a manner that respects basic human rights and the culture of the local people impacted by our operations we continue to make significant expenditures on community development education training and cultural programs which include 

 

in december 2000 we endorsed the joint us state departmentbritish foreign office voluntary principles on human rights and security voluntary principles we participated in developing these voluntary principles with other major natural resources companies and international human rights organizations and they are incorporated into our human rights policy and site level projects 

we also are currently integrating the united nations guiding principles on business and human rights into our human rights program by conducting a corporate level human rights impact assessment the results of this assessment will be used to evaluate and help direct our human rights program going forward including a review of our human rights policy we also participate in a multiindustry human rights working group to help us learn from peer companies and determine the best way to integrate human rights due diligence into our business practices and to support our voluntary principles program 

we believe that our social and economic development programs are responsive to the issues raised by the local communities near our areas of operation and should help us maintain good relations with the surrounding communities and avoid disruptions of mining operations as part of our ongoing annual commitment to sustainable community development we have made significant investments in social programs including inkind support and administration across our global operations over the last three years these investments have averaged 179 million per year nevertheless social and political instability in the areas of our operations may adversely impact our mining operations refer to item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

south america  cerro verde has provided a variety of community support projects over the years following engagements with regional and local governments civic leaders and development agencies in 2006 cerro verde committed to support the costs for a new potable water treatment plant to serve arequipa in addition an agreement was reached with the peruvian government for development of a water storage and distribution network which was 

 26 

financed by the cerro verde civil association the association the association manages contributions made by cerro verde for projects that focus on education training health cultural preservation and basic infrastructure 

cerro verde has also reached agreement with the regional government of arequipa the national government sedapar and other local institutions to allow it to finance engineer and construct a wastewater treatment plant for the city of arequipa refer to mda for further discussion treating this water will improve the rio chilis water quality enhance agriculture products grown in the area and reduce waterborne illnesses 

indonesia  in 1996 ptfi established the freeport partnership fund for community development the partnership fund through which ptfi has made available funding and technical assistance to support community development initiatives in the areas of health education and economic development of the area ptfi has committed through 2016 to provide one percent of its annual revenue for the development of the local people in its area of operation through the partnership fund our share of contributions to the partnership fund totaled 41 million  in 2013  39 million  in 2012  and 50 million  in 2011  

the amungme and kamoro community development organization  lembaga pengembangan masyarakat amungme dan kamoro  or lpmak oversees disbursement of the program funds we contribute to the partnership fund lpmak is governed by a board of commissioners and a board of directors which are comprised of representatives from the local amungme and kamoro tribal communities government leaders church leaders and one representative of ptfi on each board the amungme and kamoro people are original inhabitants of the land in our area of operations 

security matters    consistent with our cow in indonesia and our commitment to protect our employees and property we have taken steps to provide a safe and secure working environment as part of its security program ptfi maintains its own internal security department which is unarmed and performs functions such as protecting company facilities monitoring shipments of supplies and products assisting in traffic control and aiding in emergency response operations the security department has received human rights training and each member is required to certify his or her compliance with our human rights policy 

ptfi’s share of costs for its internal civilian security department totaled 51 million for 2013  52 million for 2012  and 37 million for 2011  

ptfi and all businesses and residents of indonesia rely on the indonesian government for the maintenance of public order upholding the rule of law and the protection of personnel and property the grasberg minerals district has been designated by the indonesian government as one of indonesia’s vital national assets this designation results in the police and to a lesser extent the military playing a significant role in protecting the area of our operations the indonesian government is responsible for employing police and military personnel and directing their operations 

from the outset of ptfi’s operations the indonesian government has looked to ptfi to provide logistical and infrastructure support and assistance for these necessary services because of the limited resources of the indonesian government and the remote location of and lack of development in papua ptfi’s financial support for the indonesian government security institutions assigned to the operations area represents a prudent response to its requirements to protect its workforce and property better ensuring that personnel are properly fed and lodged and have the logistical resources to patrol ptfi’s roads and secure its operating area in addition the provision of such support is consistent with ptfi’s obligations under the cow reflects our philosophy of responsible corporate citizenship and is in keeping with our commitment to pursue practices that will promote human rights 

ptfi’s share of support costs for the governmentprovided security was 25 million in 2013  22 million in 2012  and 14 million in 2011  this supplemental support consists of various infrastructure and other costs such as food housing fuel travel vehicle repairs allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs and community assistance programs conducted by the military and police 

refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion of security risks in indonesia 

africa  tfm has committed to assist the communities living within its concession in the katanga province of the drc initiatives include an integrated malaria control program construction renovation and building of local health facilities construction and renovation of local schools installation of over 90 clean water wells in rural villages as well as construction of urban water distribution systems and economic development programs supporting 

 27 

development and training of local entrepreneurs contractors and farmers we have also made significant investments in infrastructure in the region that will have lasting benefits to the country including upgrading a portion of a national road and the regional power generation and transmission systems 

through the amended and restated mining convention tfm has also committed to contribute 03 percent of net sales revenue from production to a community development fund to assist the local communities with development of local infrastructure and related services including health education and agriculture the tfm social community fund is managed by a board of directors comprised of two local community representatives one representative nominated by the provincial governor and four tfm representatives a community stakeholder forum comprised of 40 community representatives provides for increased community participation and input regarding project priorities community needs and transparency of fund management the tfm social community fund contributions totaled 4 million  in each of the years 2013  2012  and 2011  

security matters  tfm maintains an unarmed internal security department the national government also has assigned mines police to the tfm concession area the mines police are a division of the congolese national police and are responsible for maintaining security in mining concessions throughout the drc tfm provides food housing monetary allowances and logistical support as well as direct payments to the government for the provision of the security assigned to the concession area the total cost to tfm for this support including inkind support totaled less than 1 million in each of the years 2013  2012  and 2011  

tfm also participates in monthly security coordination meetings with host country security personnel other mining companies and representatives from the united nations to discuss security issues and concerns as an outcome of the coordination meetings tfm has partnered with monusco united nations stabilization mission in the drc to conduct human rights training in the tfm concession for host government security personnel local representatives and tfm security employees

mineral reserves 

recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves from our mining operations summarized below and detailed on the following pages have been calculated as of december 31 2013  in accordance with industry guide 7 as required by the securities exchange act of 1934 proven and probable reserves may not be comparable to similar information regarding mineral reserves disclosed in accordance with the guidance of other countries proven and probable mineral reserves were determined by the use of mapping drilling sampling assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry as more fully discussed below the term “reserve” as used in the reserve data presented here means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination the term “proven reserves” means mineral reserves for which 1 quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops trenches workings or drill holes 2 grade andor quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and 3 the sites for inspection sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established the term “probable reserves” means mineral reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves but the sites for inspection sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced the degree of assurance although lower than that for proven reserves is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 

our mineral reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies we conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk we revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies our estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves are prepared by and are the responsibility of our employees a majority of these estimates are reviewed and verified by independent experts in mining geology and reserve determination 

estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves at december 31 2013  were determined using longterm average prices of 200  per pound for copper consistent with the longterm average copper price used since december 31 2010 1000  per ounce for gold and 10  per pound for molybdenum for the threeyear period ended december 31 2013  lme spot copper prices averaged 364  per pound london pm gold prices averaged 1550  per ounce and the weekly average price of molybdenum quoted by metals week  averaged 1285  per pound 

the recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves presented in the table below represent the estimated metal quantities from which we expect to be paid after application of estimated metallurgical recovery rates and smelter recovery rates where applicable recoverable reserves are the part of a mineral deposit that we estimate can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination

in defining our openpit reserves we apply a “variable cutoff grade” strategy the objective of this strategy is to maximize the net present value of our operations we use a breakeven cutoff grade to define the insitu reserves for our underground ore bodies the breakeven cutoff grade is defined for a metric ton of ore as that equivalent copper grade once produced and sold that generates sufficient revenue to cover all operating and administrative costs associated with our production 

our copper mines may contain other commercially recoverable metals such as gold molybdenum silver and cobalt we value all commercially recoverable metals in terms of a copper equivalent percentage to determine a single cutoff grade copper equivalent percentage is used to express the relative value of multimetal ores in terms of one metal the calculation expresses the relative value of the ore using estimates of contained metal quantities metals prices as used for reserve determination recovery rates treatment charges and royalties our molybdenum properties use a molybdenum cutoff grade 

the table below shows the minimum cutoff grade by process for each of our existing ore bodies as of december 31 2013  



 35 

drill hole spacing data is used by mining professionals such as geologists and geological engineers in determining the suitability of data coverage on a relative basis in a given deposit type and mining method scenario so as to achieve a given level of confidence in the resource estimate drill hole spacing is only one of several criteria necessary to establish resource classification drilling programs are typically designed to achieve an optimum sample spacing to support the level of confidence in results that apply to a particular stage of development of a mineral deposit 

the following table sets forth the average drill hole spacing based on average sample distance or drill pattern spacing for proven and probable ore reserves by process type 



 36 

production sequencing 

the following chart illustrates our current plans for sequencing and producing our proven and probable reserves at each of our ore bodies and the years in which we currently expect production from each ore body the chart also shows the term of ptfis cow production volumes are typically lower in the first few years for each ore body as development activities are ongoing and as the mine ramps up to full production and production volumes may also be lower as the mine reaches the end of its life the ultimate timing of the start of production from our undeveloped mines is dependent upon a number of factors including the results of our exploration and development efforts and may vary from the dates shown below in addition we develop our mine plans based on maximizing the net present value from the ore bodies significant additional capital expenditures will be required at many of these mines in order to achieve the lifeofmine plans reflected below 

mill and leach stockpiles 

mill and leach stockpiles generally contain lower grade ores that have been extracted from the ore body and are available for copper recovery for mill stockpiles recovery is through milling concentrating smelting and refining or alternatively by concentrate leaching for leach stockpiles recovery is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities 

because it is generally impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count reasonable estimation methods are employed the quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grades of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles 

expected copper recovery rates for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing the recoverable copper in mill stockpiles once entered into the production process can be produced into copper concentrate almost immediately 

 37 

expected copper recovery rates for leach stockpiles are determined using smallscale laboratory tests small to largescale column testing which simulates the productionscale process historical trends and other factors including mineralogy of the ore and rock type total copper recovery in leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low percentage to more than 90 percent depending on several variables including processing methodology processing variables mineralogy and particle size of the rock for newly placed material on active stockpiles as much as 80 percent of total copper recovery may be extracted during the first year and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years 

processes and recovery rates are monitored continuously and recovery rate estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes 

following are our stockpiles and the estimated recoverable copper contained within those stockpiles as of december 31 2013  

 

mineralized material 

we hold various properties containing mineralized material that we believe could be brought into production should market conditions warrant however permitting and significant capital expenditures would be required before operations could commence at these properties mineralized material is a mineralized body that has been delineated by appropriately spaced drilling andor underground sampling to support the reported tonnage and average metal grades such a deposit cannot qualify as recoverable proven and probable reserves until legal and economic feasibility are confirmed based upon a comprehensive evaluation of development costs unit costs grades recoveries and other material factors estimated mineralized materials as presented on the following page were assessed using prices of 220  per pound for copper 1000  per ounce for gold and 12  per pound for molybdenum

approximately 41 percent of our total us net undeveloped acres are covered by leases that expire from 2014 to 2016 however a significant portion of this acreage is expected to be retained by drilling operations or other means the lease for our morocco acreage expires in 2016 however we have the ability to extend the lease through 2019 

oil and gas properties 

our oil and gas properties are subject to customary royalty interests liens incident to operating agreements liens for current taxes and other burdens including other mineral encumbrances and restrictions we do not believe that any of these burdens materially interfere with our use of the properties in the operation of our business 

we believe that we have satisfactory title to or rights in all of our producing properties as is customary in the oil and gas industry we make minimal investigation of title at the time we acquire undeveloped properties we make title investigations and receive title opinions of local counsel only before we commence drilling operations we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our other assets although title to our properties is subject to encumbrances in certain cases we believe that none of these burdens will materially detract from the value of our properties or from our interest therein or will materially interfere with our use in the operation of our business 

following are descriptions of our primary us oil and gas properties

gulf of mexico    multiple development and exploration opportunities have been identified in the deepwater gom that are expected to benefit from tieback opportunities to available production capacity at the fm og operated largescale holstein marlin and horn mountain deepwater production platforms 

holstein in which we have a 100 percent working interest is located in green canyon and has production facilities capable of producing in excess of 100 thousand barrels of oil equivalents mboe per day the holstein platform rig refurbishment program was conducted in the second half of 2013 in preparation for drilling and workover activity which commenced in firstquarter 2014 over the 2014 to 2016 period we expect to drill seven sidetrack wells from the holstein platform and five subsea tieback wells from contracted drill ships to enhance production volumes from the spar nearterm tieback prospects in the holstein area include holstein deep and copper 

the holstein deep development in which we have a 100 percent working interest is located four miles west of the holstein platform fm og acquired the acreage associated with this development in the 2013 lease sale held by the bureau of ocean energy management two successful wells had previously been drilled and encountered approximately 500 net feet of oil pay in recent years we plan to delineate this prospect during 2014 

the copper exploration prospect in which we have a 100 percent working interest is located southeast of the holstein field in 4400 feet of water and is a subsea tieback opportunity to the holstein facility the prospect is a holstein analog play with pliocene objectives and has a proposed total depth of 14500 feet 

development of the lucius field in keathley canyon in which our subsidiary plains offshore has a 2333 percent working interest is progressing with first production anticipated in the second half of 2014 the geologic results from the six wells drilled since 2009 confirm a significant oil resource subsea infrastructure is currently being installed and topside facilities are more than 90 percent complete and on schedule to be delivered and lifted into place during 2014 the sanctioned development of lucius is a subsea development consisting of a truss spar hull located in 7200 feet of water with a topside capacity of 80 thousand barrels mbbls of oil per day and 450 million cubic feet mmcf of gas per day

eagle ford  we have an attractive position in an oil and nglrich section of the eagle ford shale play in south texas production from the field has grown significantly in recent years and sales averaged 46  mboe per day for the sevenmonth period following the acquisition of our oil and gas operations in 2013 as part of our capital spending reduction initiatives we have reduced drilling activity at eagle ford from eight rigs in mid2013 at december 31 2013  there were three drilling rigs operating which we expect to reduce to two during 2014 at december 31 2013  there were 36 wells that were drilling or were drilled and pending completion or connection to pipelines 

california    development plans are principally focused on maintaining stable production levels in the long established producing fields onshore california through continued drilling 

haynesville    we have rights to a substantial natural gas resource located in the haynesville shale play in north louisiana drilling activities in recent years have been significantly reduced to maximize cash flows in a low natural gas price environment and to benefit from potentially higher future natural gas prices 

inboard lower tertiarycretaceous  we have an industry leading position in the emerging shallowwater inboard lower tertiarycretaceous natural gas trend located on the shelf of the gom and onshore south louisiana we have a significant onshore and offshore lease acreage position with highquality prospects and the potential to develop a significant longterm lowcost source of natural gas data from eight wells drilled to date indicate the presence of geologic formations that are analogous to productive formations in the deepwater gom and onshore in the gulf coast region the nearterm focus is on defining the trend onshore we are currently completing two inboard lower tertiarycretaceous exploration prospects including one onshore well and plan to perform production tests on these two wells and a third well in 2014 

the lomond north discovery well within the highlander area in which we are the operator and have a 72 percent working interest located in st martin parish louisiana has encountered gas pay in several wilcox and cretaceous aged sands between 24000 feet and 29000 feet the wireline log and core data obtained from the wilcox and cretaceous sand packages indicated favorable reservoir characteristics with approximately 150 feet of net pay the lomond north discovery well is currently in completion operations to test lower wilcox and cretaceous objectives found below the salt weld we have identified multiple exploratory prospects in the highlander area where we control rights to approximately 56000 gross acres 

during 2013  we commenced completion operations at davy jones no 2 in which we have a 75 percent working interest located on south marsh island block 234 flow testing is anticipated in the first half of 2014 during 2014 we also plan to complete the blackbeard west no 2 well in which we have a 92 percent working interest located on ship shoal block 188 the lineham creek exploration well in which we have a 36 percent working interest located in cameron parish has been suspended while future plans are being developed 

future production from certain specified inboard lower tertiarycretaceous exploration prospects is subject to a five percent overriding royalty interest held by gulf coast ultra deep royalty trust the overriding royalty interest is proportionately reduced based on our working interest in each prospect as provided in the trust documents at december 31 2013 we beneficially owned 27 percent of the royalty trust refer to note 2 for further discussion of the royalty trust 

morocco  we have a commitment to fund and drill two wells offshore the kingdom of morocco we expect to commence drilling of the first exploration well in early 2015

production and sales data 

the following table presents summary production data average realized prices and average production costs for our oil and gas operations for the sevenmonth period in 2013 following the acquisition dates 



 

oil and natural gas reserves 

our reserve volumes have been determined in accordance with the current regulations and guidelines established by the sec which require the use of an average price calculated as the twelvemonth average of the firstdayofthemonth historical reference price as adjusted for location and quality differentials unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements excluding escalations based upon future conditions and the impact of derivatives reference prices for reserve determination are the wti spot price for crude oil and the henry hub spot price for natural gas at december 31 2013 our estimates were based on reference prices of 9694  per barrel and 367  per mmbtu all of our oil and natural gas reserves are located in the us 

proved reserves all of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves at december 31 2013 are based upon reserve reports prepared by the independent petroleum engineering firms of netherland sewell  associates inc nsai and ryder scott company lp ryder scott the scope and results of procedures employed by nsai and ryder scott are summarized in letters that are filed as exhibits to this annual report on form 10k for purposes of reserve estimation we and our independent petroleum engineers used technical and economic data including well logs geologic maps seismic data well test data production data historical price and cost information and property ownership interests our reserves have been estimated using deterministic methods standard engineering and geoscience methods were used or a combination of methods including performance analysis volumetric analysis and analogy which we and our independent petroleum engineers considered to be appropriate and necessary to categorize and estimate reserves in accordance with sec definitions and regulations a substantial portion of these reserves are for undeveloped locations such reserves are based on estimates of reserve volumes and recovery efficiencies along with analogy to properties with similar geologic and reservoir characteristics because these estimates depend on many assumptions any or all of which may differ substantially from actual results reserve estimates may differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that we ultimately recover 

 44 

proved reserves represent quantities of oil and natural gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations the term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate at december 31 2013 our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves totaled 464  mmboe of which 80 percent was comprised of oil including ngls 



a includes 20  mmbbls of ngl proved reserves consisting of 14  mmbbls of proved developed and 6  mmbbls of proved undeveloped 

at december 31 2013  we have an estimated total proved reserve life of seven years and a proved developed reserve life of 46 years at december 31 2013 our proved undeveloped reserves are 34 percent of our total proved reserves 93 percent of our proved undeveloped reserves are scheduled for development within five years and 91 percent or 32 billion of our estimated future proved undeveloped capital is associated with the development of those reserves the only exceptions are related to four planned sidetrack development wells in certain shelf and deepwater gom properties that cannot be executed until the current producing wells deplete during the seven month period from june 1 2013 to december 31 2013 we invested 369 million and converted 19 mmboe to proved developed 

during the seven month period from june 1 2013 to december 31 2013 we participated in 66 gross exploratory wells of which 65 were successful and 95 gross development wells of which 94 were successful refer to drilling activities during this period proved reserve additions from extensions and discoveries totaled 24 mmboe 

the following table reflects the present value of estimated future net cash flows before income taxes from the production and sale of our estimated proved reserves reconciled to the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows standardized measure at december 31 2013  in millions 



a in accordance with sec guidelines estimates of future net cash flows from our proved reserves and the present value thereof are made using the twelvemonth average of the firstdayofthemonth historical reference prices as adjusted for location and quality differentials reference prices as of december 31 2013  were 9694  per barrel of oil and 367  per mmbtu of natural gas these prices are held constant throughout the life of the oil and gas properties except where such guidelines permit alternate treatment including the use of fixed and determinable contractual price escalations in accordance with the guidelines and excluding the impact of derivative instruments the average realized prices used in our reserve reports as of december 31 2013  were 9967  per barrel of oil and 364  per mcf of natural gas our reference prices are the wti spot price for crude oil and the henry hub spot price for natural gas and are calculated as the twelvemonth average of the firstdayofthemonth historical prices 

 45 

b the present value of estimated future net cash flows before income taxes pv10 is not considered a us generally accepted accounting principle gaap financial measure we believe that our pv10 presentation is an important measure and useful to our investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves before taking into account the related future income taxes as such taxes may differ among companies because of differences in the amounts and timing of deductible basis net operating loss carryforwards and other factors we believe investors use our pv10 as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our proved reserves to the reserve estimates of other companies pv10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under us gaap and is not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves pv10 should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under us gaap 

probable reserves all of our estimated probable oil and natural gas reserves at december 31 2013 are based upon reserve reports prepared by the independent petroleum engineering firms of nsai and ryder scott probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which together with proved reserves are as likely as not to be recovered in addition to the uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of proved reserves probable reserves may be assigned to areas where data control or interpretations of available data are less certain even if the interpreted reservoir continuity of structure or productivity does not meet the reasonably certain criterion probable reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir probable reserve estimates also include potential incremental qualities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than assumed for proved reserves undeveloped reserves that meet the reasonably certain economic and other requirements to be classified as proved undeveloped except that they are not expected to be developed within five years are classified as probable reserves at december 31 2013 our estimated probable oil and natural gas reserves totaled 184 mmboe of which 83 percent was comprised of oil including ngls 



a includes 6  mmbbls of ngl probable reserves consisting of 2  mmbbls of probable developed and 4  mmbbls of probable undeveloped 

b reflects reserves associated with incremental recovery from existing productioninjection wells that require minimal to no future development costs and reserves associated with work performed on existing producersinjectors that do not meet the reasonable certainty requirements to be classified as proved reserves 

internal control and qualifications of third party engineers and internal staff  the technical personnel responsible for preparing the reserve estimates at nsai and ryder scott meet the requirements regarding qualifications independence objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers both nsai and ryder scott are independent firms of petroleum engineers geologists geophysicists and petrophysicists neither firm owns an interest in our properties nor are employed on a contingent fee basis our internal reservoir engineering staff are led and overseen by our vice president of engineering who has over 37 years of technical experience in petroleum engineering and reservoir evaluation and analysis this individual directs the activities of our internal reservoir staff for the internal reserve estimation process and also to provide the appropriate data to nsai and ryder scott for our yearend oil and natural gas reserves estimation process

financial risks 

declines in the market prices of copper gold andor oil could adversely affect our earnings cash flows and asset values and if sustained could adversely affect our ability to repay debt fluctuations in the market prices of copper gold or oil can cause significant volatility in our financial performance and adversely affect the trading prices of our debt and common stock 

our financial results vary with fluctuations in the market prices of the commodities we produce primarily copper gold and oil and to a lesser extent molybdenum silver cobalt and natural gas for further information about the market prices of our primary commodities refer to the discussion below and mda a substantial or extended decline in the market prices of these commodities could have a material adverse effect on our financial results the value of our assets andor our ability to repay our debt and meet our other fixed obligations and could depress the trading prices of our common stock and of our publicly traded debt securities 

additionally if the market prices for the commodities we produce decline for a sustained period of time we may have to revise our operating plans including curtailing production halting or delaying expansion projects reducing operating costs and capital expenditures and discontinuing certain exploration and development programs we may be unable to decrease our costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues and may incur losses 

fluctuations in commodities prices can occur because of varied and complex factors beyond our control including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

copper prices may also be affected by demand from china which has become the largest consumer of refined copper in the world and by increases in demand for industrial products containing copper 

factors particularly affecting gold prices may include the relative strength of the us dollar to other currencies inflation and interest rate expectations purchases and sales of gold by governments and central banks demand from china and india two of the world ’ s largest consumers of gold and demand for jewelry containing gold 

 48 

crude oil prices may also be affected by actions of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and other major oil producing nations political and weather conditions in oil producing regions transportation and refinery capacity the amount of foreign imports of oil into the us and potential changes in us laws restricting oil exports 

substantially all of our copper concentrate and cathode sales contracts provide final copper pricing in a specified future month generally one to four months from the shipment date based primarily on quoted london metal exchange lme monthly average spot copper prices accordingly in times of rising copper prices our revenues benefit from adjustments to the final pricing of provisionally priced sales pursuant to contracts entered into in prior periods in times of falling copper prices the opposite occurs 

a decline in the price of crude oil and to a lesser extent natural gas could also result in a ceiling writedown of the carrying value of our proved oil and natural gas properties andor of goodwill recorded in connection with our oil and gas acquisitions at december 31 2013  the ceiling with respect to our oil and gas properties exceeded the net capitalized costs of those properties by approximately 4 percent and we did not record an impairment given the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices it is likely that our estimate of discounted future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves will change in the near term if crude oil and natural gas prices decline in the future even if only by a small amount impairments of our oil and gas properties could occur 

for further discussion of our accounting policies and estimates used in evaluating our oil and gas properties and goodwill for impairment refer to note 1 and mda any impairment charge related to our oil and gas properties or goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and stockholders equity but would have no effect on cash flows 

our debt and other financial commitments may limit our financial and operating flexibility 

at december 31 2013  our total consolidated debt was 207 billion including 172 billion incurred or assumed in connection with the acquisition of plains exploration  production company pxp and our total consolidated cash was 20 billion although we have been successful in repaying significant amounts of debt in the past there can be no assurance that we can do so in the future we also have various other financial commitments including for reclamation and environmental obligations takeorpay contracts derivative contracts and leases our level of indebtedness and other financial commitments could have important consequences to our business including the following 

 

 

 

 

in addition a future downgrade in our credit rating could negatively affect our cost of and ability to access capital at december 31 2013  our senior unsecured debt was rated bbb with a negative outlook by standard and poor’s bbb with a stable outlook by fitch ratings and baa3 with a stable outlook by moody’s investors service we cannot be assured that our credit ratings will not be downgraded in the future in addition a downgrade could affect our requirements to provide significant financial assurance of our performance under certain legal requirements and contractual arrangements refer to the following risk factor for more information 

under us federal and state laws that require closure and reclamation plans for our mines we generally are required to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement those plans if we are unable to do so we are also required to provide bonds or other forms of financial assurance in connection with our oil and gas operations   the failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us 

we are required by us federal and state mining laws to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans if we are unable to do so the us environmental protection 

 49 

agency epa and state agencies may also seek financial assurance for investigation and remediation actions that are required under settlements of enforcement actions under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or equivalent state regulations 

with respect to our mining operations most of our financial assurance obligations are imposed by state laws that vary significantly by jurisdiction currently there are no financial assurance requirements under cercla but in july 2009 epa published a notice identifying classes of facilities within the hardrock mining industry for which the agency will develop financial responsibility requirements under cercla in epas semiannual regulatory agenda issued in november 2013 epa indicated that it intends to propose regulations regarding hardrock mining financial responsibility in august 2016 it is uncertain how the new requirements if promulgated will affect the amount and form of our existing and future financial assurance obligations 

we are also subject to financial assurance requirements in connection with our oil and gas operations under both state and federal laws for example permits bonding and insurance are required to drill operate and plug and abandon wells also the bureau of ocean energy management boem and the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement bsee regulations applicable to lessees in federal waters require that lessees have substantial us assets and net worth or post bonds or other acceptable financial assurance that the regulatory obligations will be met financial responsibility requirements are also required under the oil pollution act of 1990 to cover containment and cleanup costs resulting from an oil spill 

boem has signaled its intention to redesign and implement revised financial assurance requirements associated with offshore plugging and abandonment obligations boem has recently taken a stricter approach regarding the level of decommissioning liabilities to be included in its financial test for purposes of determining eligibility for exemption from financial assurance requirements it is uncertain whether additional changes will be implemented by the boem and how these changes might affect the form and amount of our existing and future financial assurance obligations associated with our offshore activities in federal waters 

as of december 31 2013  our financial assurance obligations associated with closure reclamation and remediation in our mining and plugging and abandonment obligations in our oil and gas operations totaled approximately 24 billion  and a substantial portion of these obligations were satisfied by fcx guarantees and financial capability demonstrations if our financial condition were to deteriorate substantially or our credit rating were downgraded we may be required to provide additional or alternative forms of financial assurance such as letters of credit surety bonds or collateral these other forms of assurance would be costly to provide and depending on our financial condition and market conditions may be difficult or impossible to obtain failure to provide the required financial assurance could result in the closure of mines or suspension of the affected oil and gas operations 

for additional information refer to the environmental risk factor mine closure regulations impose substantial costs on our operations we also have plugging and abandonment obligations relating to our oil and gas operations 

movements in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively affect our operating results 

the functional currency for most of our operations is the us dollar all of our revenues and a significant portion of our costs are denominated in us   dollars however some costs and certain asset and liability accounts are denominated in local currencies including the indonesian rupiah australian dollar chilean peso peruvian nuevo sol and euro generally our results are positively affected when the us   dollar strengthens in relation to those foreign currencies and adversely affected when the us dollar weakens in relation to those foreign currencies refer to item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a summary of the estimated impact of changes in foreign currency rates on our annual operating costs 

from time to time we may implement currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates however our hedging strategies may not be successful and any of our unhedged foreign currency payments will continue to be subject to market fluctuations 

 50 

international risks 

our international operations are subject to political social and geographic risks of doing business in countries outside the us 

we are a usbased natural resource company with substantial mining assets located outside of the us as of december 31 2013  substantially all of our oil and gas operations were in the us we conduct international mining operations in indonesia peru chile and the democratic republic of congo drc accordingly in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in countries outside the us our business may be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties in each of these countries risks of conducting business in countries outside of the us include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our insurance does not cover most losses caused by the above described risks accordingly our exploration development and production activities outside of the us may be substantially affected by many unpredictable factors beyond our control some of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our international operations must comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption and antibribery laws of the other jurisdictions in which we operate there has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of these laws although we have a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of violations of such laws any violation could result in significant criminal or civil fines and penalties litigation and loss of operating licenses or permits and may damage our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are involved in several significant tax proceedings and other tax matters with the indonesian and peruvian tax authorities refer to note 12  for further discussion of these matters other risks specific to certain countries in which we operate are discussed in more detail below 

because our grasberg minerals district is our most significant operating asset our business may continue to be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties and security risks in indonesia 

our mining operations in indonesia are conducted by our subsidiary pt freeport indonesia ptfi pursuant to a contract of work cow with the indonesian government maintaining a good working relationship with the indonesian government is important to us because of the significance of our indonesia operations to our business and because our mining operations there are among indonesias most significant business enterprises partially because of their significance to indonesias economy the environmentally sensitive area in which they are located 

 51 

and the number of people employed our indonesia operations have been the subject of political debates and of criticism in the indonesian press and have been the target of protests and occasional violence 

in 2009 indonesia enacted a mining law 2009 mining law which operates under a licensing system that is significantly less protective of licensees than the contract of work system that governs ptfi the 2009 mining law and the regulations issued pursuant to that law provide that contracts of work would continue to be honored until their expiration however the regulations including those issued in january 2014 attempt to apply certain provisions of the 2009 mining law and regulations to existing contracts of work and seek to apply the licensing system to any extension periods of contracts of work 

in january 2012 the president of indonesia issued a decree calling for the creation of a team of ministers to evaluate contracts of work for adjustment to the 2009 mining law and to take steps to assess and determine the indonesian governments position on reduction to the size of contract concessions increasing government revenues and domestic processing of minerals we have been engaged in discussions with officials of the indonesian government to complete this evaluation process and obtain an extension of the ptfi cow beyond its primary term ending in 2021 to 2041 as provided under the terms of the cow which can only be modified by mutual agreement between ptfi and the indonesian government we cannot predict the outcome of our engagement with the indonesian government regarding the relationship between the 2009 mining law and related regulations and our cow nor whether or on what terms we will be able to secure an extension of our cow but the outcome of these discussions may result in revisions to certain terms of the cow 

in january 2014 the indonesian government published regulations providing that holders of contracts of work with existing processing facilities in indonesia may continue to export product through january 12 2017 but established new requirements for the continued export of copper concentrates including the imposition of a progressive export duty on copper concentrates in the amount of 25 percent in 2014 rising to 60 percent by mid2016 ptfi’s cow authorizes it to export concentrates and specifies the taxes and other fiscal terms available to its operations the cow states that ptfi shall not be subject to taxes duties or fees subsequently imposed or approved by the indonesian government except as expressly provided in the cow additionally ptfi complied with the requirements of its cow for local processing by arranging for the construction and commissioning of indonesia’s only copper smelter and refinery which is owned and operated by pt smelting ptfis 25 percent owned smelter 

the january 2014 regulations conflict with ptfi ’ s contractual rights under its cow we are working with the indonesian government to clarify the situation and to defend ptfi ’ s rights under its cow ptfi is also seeking to obtain the required administrative permits for 2014 exports which have been delayed as a result of the new regulations 

as of february 21 2014 ptfi has not obtained administrative approval for 2014 exports ptfi has implemented nearterm changes to its operations to coordinate its concentrate production with pt smelting’s operating plans since midjanuary 2014 ptfi’s milling rate has averaged approximately 112000 metric tons of ore per day which is approximately half of normal rates ptfi is engaging with the government of indonesia to reach a resolution that would enable ptfi to resume normal operations as soon as possible in the event that ptfi is unable to resume normal operations for an extended period we plan to consider further actions including constraining operating costs deferring capital expenditures and implementing workforce reductions ptfi may also be required to declare force majeure under its concentrate sales agreements 

in april 2014 indonesia will hold elections for legislators at the national provincial and district levels the presidential election will be held in july 2014 with a runoff in september 2014 if required the outcome of these elections could affect the country ’ s policies pertaining to foreign investment 

indonesia has also faced separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces several separatist groups have sought political independence for the province of papua where our grasberg minerals district is located in response indonesia enacted regional autonomy laws which became effective january   1 2001 the manner in which those laws are being implemented and the degree of political and economic autonomy they may bring to individual provinces including papua remain uncertain and continue to be ongoing issues in indonesian politics in papua there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the indonesian military social economic and political instability in papua could materially and adversely affect us if it results in damage to our property or interruption of our indonesian operations 

 52 

since july 2009 there have been 51 incidents in and around the grasberg minerals district including along the road leading to our mining and milling operations which have resulted in 17 fatalities and 59 injuries the safety of our workforce is a critical concern and ptfi continues to work with the indonesian government to address security issues the investigation of these incidents is ongoing we also continue to limit the use of the road leading to our mining and milling operations to secured convoys any additional prolonged limitations on access to the road could adversely affect our indonesian operations 

large numbers of illegal miners continue to operate along the river used to transport the tailings from the mill to ptfis governmentapproved tailings management area in the lowlands the illegal miners have periodically clashed with police who have attempted unsuccessfully for years to move them away from our facilities in 2006 the illegal miners temporarily blocked the road leading to the grasberg mine and mill in protest and ptfi temporarily suspended mining and milling operations as a precautionary measure 

we cannot predict whether additional incidents will occur that could disrupt or suspend our indonesian operations if other disruptive incidents occur they could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in ways that we cannot predict at this time 

for discussion of labor disruptions at ptfi refer to the operational risk factor labor unrest and activism could disrupt our operations and may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we will not mine all of our ore reserves in indonesia before the initial term of our cow expires 

the initial term of ptfis cow expires in 2021 but can be extended for two 10year periods subject to indonesian government approval which pursuant to the cow cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably our proven and probable ore reserves in indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041 and our current mine plan and planned operations are based on the assumption that we will receive the two 10year extensions as a result we will not mine all of these ore reserves during the initial term of the current cow prior to the end of 2021 we expect to mine 26 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable ore at december 31 2013  representing 32   percent of ptfis share of recoverable copper reserves and 45   percent of its share of recoverable gold reserves there can be no assurance that the indonesian government will approve our cow extensions for further discussion refer to the above risk factor because our grasberg minerals district is our most significant operating asset our business may continue to be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties and security risks in indonesia 

ptfis cow may be subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations and if a dispute arises we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of an international arbitration panel 

ptfis cow was entered into under indonesias 1967 foreign capital investment law which provides guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization the cow may be subject to termination by the indonesian government if we do not satisfy our contractual obligations which include the payment of royalties and taxes to the government and the satisfaction of certain mining environmental safety and health requirements 

certain indonesian laws and regulations may conflict with the mining rights established under the cow although the cow grants to ptfi the unencumbered right to operate in accordance with the cow government agencies may seek to impose additional restrictions on ptfi that could affect exploration and operating requirements for discussion of the regulations published in january 2014 by the indonesian government which conflict with our cow refer to the risk factor because our grasberg minerals district is our most significant operating asset our business may continue to be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties and security risks in indonesia 

at times certain government officials and others in indonesia have questioned the validity of contracts entered into by the indonesian government prior to may 1998  ie  during the suharto regime which lasted over 30   years including ptfis cow which was signed in december 1991 we cannot provide assurance that the validity of or our compliance with the cow will not be challenged for political or other reasons 

ptfis cow requires that disputes with the indonesian government be submitted to international arbitration accordingly if a dispute arises under the cow we face the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of an 

 53 

international arbitration panel and if we prevail in such a dispute we will face the additional risk of having to enforce the judgment of an international arbitration panel against indonesia within its own territory additionally our operations may be adversely affected while resolution of a dispute is pending 

the tenke fungurume tenke minerals district is located in the katanga province of the drc and may be adversely affected by security risks and political economic and social instability in the drc 

since gaining independence in 1960 the drc has undergone outbreaks of violence changes in national leadership and financial crises these factors heighten the risk of abrupt changes in the national policy toward foreign investors which in turn could result in unilateral modification of concessions or contracts increased taxation denial of permits or permit renewals or expropriation of assets as part of a review of all mining contracts by the ministry of mines the ministry in the drc in february 2008 we received notification that the ministry wished to renegotiate several material provisions of tenke fungurume mining sarls tfm mining contracts in october 2010 the drc government concluded its review of tfms existing mining contracts and confirmed that they are in good standing in connection with the review several amendments were made to tfm ’ s mining contracts and governing documents and in march 2012 fcxs effective ownership in tfm was reduced from 5775 percent to 56 percent 

political economic social and security risks in the drc are generally outside of our control and could adversely affect our business these risks include legal and regulatory uncertainties exposure to an environment of governmental corruption and bribery attempts to increase taxes or claims for fees and penalties by governmental officials including retroactive claims administrative disputes security risks resulting from political instability in the drc and risk of loss because of civil strife acts of war guerrilla activities insurrection and terrorism 

in addition to ongoing conflict in the eastern region of the drc there have been acts of violence in the katanga province where the tenke minerals district is located the safety of our workforce at all of our operations is our highest priority and tfm works cooperatively with government officials to address security issues however no assurance can be given that conflict or random acts of violence will not occur near or impact tenkes operations 

accordingly our tenke operations and future development activities at the tenke minerals district may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control any of which could interrupt tfm ’ s operations or future development activities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

operational risks 

our mining and oil and gas operations are subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our business 

mining  mines by their nature are subject to many operational risks some of which are outside of our control and many of which are not covered fully or in some cases even partially by insurance these operational risks which could adversely affect our business operating results and cash flow include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 54 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

managing the volume of waste rock leach material and tailings produced in our mining operations also presents significant environmental safety and engineering challenges and risks we maintain large leach pads and tailings impoundments containing viscous material which are monitored for structural stability and leakages our tailings impoundments in arid areas must have effective programs to suppress fugitive dust emissions and we must effectively monitor and treat acid rock drainage in indonesia we use a river transport system for tailings management which presents other risks as discussed elsewhere in these risk factors the failure to adequately manage these risks could result in significant personal injury loss of life property damage and damage to the environment both in and around our areas of operations as well as damage to production facilities and delays in or curtailments of production 

oil and gas  our oil and gas operations are also subject to operating hazards including well blowouts cratering explosions fires uncontrollable flows of oil gas or well fluids and pipeline ruptures as well as natural disasters such as earthquakes mudslides and hurricanes our operations in california including transportation of oil by pipelines within the city and county of los angeles are especially susceptible to damage from earthquakes and involve increased risks of personal injury property damage and marketing interruptions because of the population density of southern california our operations in the gulf of mexico gom and gulf coast region are particularly susceptible to interruption and damage from hurricanes any of these operating hazards could cause personal injuries fatalities oil spills discharge of hazardous substances into the air soil water and groundwater and other property or environmental damage lost production and revenue remediation and cleanup costs and liability for damages all of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and may not be fully covered by our insurance further drilling completing and operating wells may also be delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including unexpected geologic conditions increases in the cost of or shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and equipment and delays in the issuance of required permits by governmental agencies 

increased production costs could reduce our profitability and cash flows 

our copper mining operations require significant energy principally diesel electricity coal and natural gas most of which is obtained from third parties under longterm contracts for the year 2013 energy represented approximately 20 percent  of our consolidated copper production costs an inability to procure sufficient fuel and energy at reasonable prices could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations our consolidated copper production costs are also affected by the prices of commodities we use in our operations such as sulphuric acid grinding media steel reagents liners tires and explosives the prices of such commodities are influenced by supply and demand trends affecting the mining industry in general and other factors outside our control and such prices are at times subject to volatile movements increases in the costs of commodities that we consume or use may also significantly affect the capital costs of new projects 

in our oil and gas operations increased costs or unavailability of drilling rigs workboats experienced personnel or other equipment supplies or oil field services which may occur particularly during times of increased industry activity may adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget and could have a material adverse effect on the financial performance of our oil and gas operations 

 55 

labor unrest and activism could disrupt our operations and may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

as further described in part i items 1 and 2 business and properties we are party to labor agreements with various unions that represent employees at certain of our mining operations none of the employees of our oil and gas operations are represented by a union or covered by a collective labor agreement labor agreements are negotiated on a periodic basis and the risk exists that labor agreements may not be renewed on reasonably satisfactory terms to us or at all issues that may be raised by the collective bargaining units representing our employees are unpredictable and if raised negotiations concerning those issues may not be concluded successfully our production and sales volumes could be significantly reduced and our business financial condition and results of operations adversely affected by significant reductions in productivity or protracted work stoppages at one or more of our operations additionally if we enter into a new labor agreement with any union that significantly increases our labor costs relative to our competitors our ability to compete may be materially and adversely affected 

during 2011 ptfi was adversely affected by labor disruptions including an eightday work stoppage in july 2011 and an approximate threemonth strike that concluded in december 2011 the strike involved civil unrest transportation blockades sabotage of important operating facilities and violence additionally during firstquarter 2012 ptfi experienced work interruptions in connection with its efforts to resume normal operations and temporarily suspended operations in october 2013 ptfi entered into a new biennial labor agreement 

in fourthquarter 2011 there was an approximate twomonth labor strike at cerro verde during the negotiation of a new labor agreement the strike did not have a significant impact on production and a new threeyear agreement with the union was reached in late december 2011 in november 2013 cerro verde entered into a new fouryear labor agreement with its union which is effective upon the expiration of the current agreement beginning september 1 2014 

as of december 31 2013  49 percent  of our labor force was covered by collective bargaining agreements and one percent  of our labor force is covered by agreements that will expire during 2014  if we do not successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements with our union workers we may incur prolonged strikes and other work stoppages at our mining operations which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our mining production depends on the availability of sufficient water supplies 

our mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining ore processing and related support facilities most of our mining operations in north and south america are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant continuous production at our mines is dependent on our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies 

at our north america mining operations certain of our water supplies are supported by surface water rights which allow us to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location in arizona we are a participant in two active general stream adjudications in which the arizona courts have been attempting for over 30 years to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for two of the states largest river systems which affect four of our operating mines morenci safford sierrita and miami the legal precedent set in these proceedings may also affect our bagdad mine groundwater has historically been treated differently from surface water under arizona law which has generally allowed land owners to pump at will subject to the doctrine of reasonable use however court decisions in one of the adjudications have concluded that groundwater pumping may affect surface water thereby bringing the pumping within the jurisdiction of the general stream adjudications the effort to define the boundaries between groundwater and surface water remains contested however and is currently a primary focus of one of those adjudications because groundwater accounts for approximately 40 percent of arizona ’ s water supplies the recharacterization of any significant portion of that water as surface water could jeopardize the ability of consumers farmers ranchers municipalities and industrial users like us to continue to access water supplies that have been relied on for decades because we are a significant user of groundwater in arizona we are an active participant in the adjudication proceedings 

in colorado our surface water and groundwater rights are subject to adjudication and we are involved in legal proceedings to resolve disputes regarding priority and administration of rights including priority of some of our rights for the climax molybdenum mine in new mexico our surface water and groundwater rights are fully licensed or have been fully adjudicated 

 56 

water for our cerro verde mining operation in peru comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the rio chili watershed that collect water primarily from seasonal precipitation due to occasional drought conditions and the possibility that climate change will reduce precipitation levels temporary supply shortages are possible that could affect our current and planned cerro verde operations cerro verde completed studies to assess opportunities for additional water supplies to support current operations and potential future expansion projects cerro verde has reached agreements with the regional government of arequipa the national government the local water utility servicio de agua potable y alcantarillado de arequipa sa sedapar and other local institutions to allow it to finance engineer and construct a wastewater treatment plant for the city of arequipa cerro verde has obtained authorization to reuse an annual average of one cubic meter per second of the treated water which is expected to supplement existing water supplies to support the concentrator expansion 

water for our el abra mining operation in chile comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascotán aquifer in 2010 el abra obtained regulatory approval subject to certain conditions for the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascotán aquifer for its sulfide processing plant which began operations in 2011 el abra has sufficient water rights to support current operations however a change to the sulfide ore project such as increased production or mill processing would require additional water beyond our allowable groundwater pumping which is permitted through 2021 el abra is conducting studies to assess the feasibility of constructing a desalination plant near the pacific ocean to treat seawater for possible increased sulfide ore production or mill processing 

water for our candelaria and ojos del salado mining operations in chile comes from a nearby wastewater treatment facility and our desalination plant and pipeline that were completed in 2013 both of these sources will supply candelarias and ojos del salado ’ s longterm water needs 

although each of our mining operations currently has access to sufficient water supplies to support current operational demands some supplies are subject to unresolved claims by others and additional supplies that may be needed to support expanded operations are expensive in short supply and can be difficult to access because of logistical and legal obstacles moreover we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings on our water rights claims and uses loss of a water right loss of continued use of a currently available water supply or inability to expand our water resources could materially and adversely affect our mining operations by significantly increasing the cost of water forcing us to curtail operations preventing us from expanding operations or forcing premature closures thereby increasing andor accelerating costs or foregoing profitable operations 

in addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry our indonesia operations involve additional risks because they are located on unusually difficult terrain in a very remote area 

the grasberg minerals district is located in steep mountainous terrain in a remote area of indonesia these conditions require us to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities in addition the area receives considerable rainfall which has led to periodic floods and mudslides the mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time our insurance may not sufficiently cover an unexpected natural or operating disaster 

in may 2013 a tragic accident which resulted in 28 fatalities and 10 injuries occurred at ptfi when the rock structure above an underground ceiling for a training facility collapsed while the accident occurred outside the area of mining operations ptfi temporarily suspended mining and processing activities at the grasberg complex to conduct inspections of its facilities in coordination with indonesian government authorities following approval from indonesias department of energy and mineral resources ptfi resumed openpit mining and concentrating activities at its grasberg operations on june 24 2013 and resumed underground operations on july 9 2013 

in april 2011 two ptfi employees died in an accident when a portion of the doz underground mine experienced an uncontrolled muck flow the area was temporarily shut down during the investigation of the accident we have experienced mudtopsoil slides and slippages of material in and near our openpit operations in the past which have since october 2003 resulted in 11 fatalities and some production delays 

no assurance can be given that similar events will not occur in the future 

 57 

in addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry our africa mining operations involve additional risks because it is located in a remote area of the drc 

the tenke minerals district is located in a remote area of the drc and is subject to additional challenges including severely limited infrastructure including road bridge and rail access that is in disrepair and receives minimal maintenance limited and unreliable energy supply from antiquated equipment and from power distribution corridors that are not maintained challenges in obtaining experienced personnel security risks and limited health care in an area plagued by disease and other potential endemic health issues including malaria cholera and hiv 

additionally because of limited rail access we currently truck a significant portion of the production from the tenke mines approximately 1900 miles to ports in south africa the tenke minerals district and its future development may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control which could adversely affect their contribution to our operating results and increase the cost of future development 

our reserves are estimates and actual recoveries may vary significantly 

there are numerous uncertainties and assumptions inherent in estimating mineral and oil and natural gas reserves and geological technical and economic assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available assumptions and estimates include the geology of the ore body or reservoir development methods to be used and projected operating costs fluctuations in these variables and in commodities prices may result in lower grade reserves or resources being deemed uneconomic and could lead to a reduction in reserves or resources our actual recoveries may vary significantly from our estimated reserves decreases in estimated reserves could result in prospective increases in our depreciation depletion and amortization expense which could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations and could also result in impairment charges refer to notes 1 20 and 21 and mda   for further discussion 

we must continually replace reserves depleted by production but our exploration activities may not result in additional discoveries 

our existing mineral and oil and natural gas reserves will be depleted over time by production from our operations because our profits are derived from our mining and oil and gas operations our ability to replenish our reserves is essential to our longterm success our exploration projects involve many risks require substantial expenditures and may not result in the discovery of additional deposits or reservoirs that can be produced profitably we may not be able to discover enhance develop or acquire reserves in sufficient quantities to maintain or grow our current reserve levels which could negatively affect our business and prospects 

development projects are inherently risky and may require more capital than anticipated which could adversely affect our business 

there are many risks and uncertainties inherent in all development projects refer to mda for further discussion of our current development projects the economic feasibility of development projects is based on many factors including the accuracy of estimated reserves estimated capital and operating costs and estimated future prices of the relevant commodity the capital expenditures and time required to develop new mines wells or other projects are considerable and changes in costs or construction or drilling schedules can adversely affect project economics key factors that may affect the timing costs and outcome of such projects include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

new development projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future cash flow the actual costs production rates and economic returns of our development projects may differ materially from our estimates which may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

 58 

operations in the deepwater gom present greater operating risks than operations in the shallower waters or onshore in addition our shallow water and onshore operations that target ultradeep prospects involve greater risks and costs than conventional gom shelf and onshore gulf coast prospects   

the deepwater gom area presents significant challenges because of risks associated with geological complexity water depth and higher drilling and development costs any of which can cause substantial cost overruns the deepwater gom also lacks the infrastructure present in shallower waters which can result in significant delays in obtaining or maintaining production as a result deepwater operations may require significant time between a discovery and marketability thereby increasing the financial risk of these operations 

our inboard lower tertiarycretaceous exploration prospects target formations below the salt weld on the gom shelf and onshore in south louisiana these targets have not traditionally been the subject of exploratory activity in these regions so that little direct comparative data is available to date there has been no production of hydrocarbons from inboard lower tertiarycretaceous reservoirs in these areas the lack of comparative data and the limitations of diagnostic tools operating in the extreme temperatures and pressures encountered at these depths make it difficult to predict reservoir quality and well performance of these formations wells drilled in these formations are also significantly more expensive to drill and complete than wells drilled to more conventional depths major contributors to such increased costs include far higher temperatures and pressures encountered down hole longer drilling times and the cost and extended procurement time related to the specialized equipment required to drill and complete these types of wells 

our operations are subject to extensive regulations some of which require permits and other approvals these regulations increase our costs and in some circumstances may delay or suspend our operations 

our operations are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations that are subject to change and to changing interpretation by governmental agencies and other bodies vested with broad supervisory authority as a natural resource company compliance with environmental legal requirements is an integral and costly part of our business for additional information see environmental risks we are also subject to extensive regulation of worker health and safety including the requirements of the us federal occupational safety and health act and similar laws of other jurisdictions in the us the operation of our mines is subject to regulation by the us mine safety and health administration msha under the federal mine safety and health act of 1977 msha inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred if such inspections result in an alleged violation we may be subject to fines and penalties and in instances of alleged significant violations our mining operations could be subject to temporary or extended closures 

our oil and gas operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations that require among other things permits for the drilling and operation of wells and bonding and insurance to drill operate and plug and abandon wells and that regulate the safety of our pipelines our us offshore operations in federal waters are subject to broad regulation by the boembsee which among other things must issue permits in connection with our exploration drilling development and production plans under certain circumstances boembsee may impose penalties and may suspend or terminate any of our operations on federal leases many other governmental bodies regulate our operations and our failure to comply with these legal requirements can result in substantial penalties in addition new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations by courts or regulatory authorities occur regularly but are difficult to predict any such variations could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 

certain of our undeveloped oil and gas leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage 

approximately 41 percent of our total us net undeveloped acres are covered by leases that expire from 2014 to 2016 with respect to our undeveloped oil and gas leaseholds unless production in paying quantities is established on units during the term of the leases the leases will expire if leases expire and we are unable to renew or obtain new leases we will lose our right to develop those properties our drilling plans are subject to change based upon various factors including drilling results oil and natural gas prices the availability and cost of capital drilling and production costs availability of drilling services and equipment gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals refer to items 1 and 2 business and properties for further discussion of our oil and gas operations acreage

we have limited control over the development of oil and gas properties in which we have an interest but do not operate 

certain of our oil and gas properties including lucius ram powell lineham creek haynesville and portions of our eagle ford acreage are operated by other companies and involve third party working interest owners as a result we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties including compliance with environmental safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties additionally we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the operating costs and capital expenditures of such projects these limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for their operation andor funding of these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs result in lower production and materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our business may be adversely affected by information technology disruptions 

cybersecurity incidents are increasing in frequency evolving in nature and include but are not limited to installation of malicious software unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data we have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past and may experience them in the future we believe that we have implemented appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks however given the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of information technology disruptions we could be subject to manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

environmental risks 

our operations are subject to complex and evolving environmental laws and regulations compliance with environmental regulatory requirements involves significant costs and may constrain our expansion opportunities 

our operations both in the us and internationally are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing the generation transportation and disposal of hazardous substances waste disposal air emissions water discharges remediation restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination including oil spill cleanup mine closure and well plug and abandonment requirements protection of endangered and protected species and other related matters in addition we must obtain regulatory permits and approvals to start continue and expand operations laws such as cercla and similar state laws may subject us to joint and several liability for environmental damages caused by previous owners or operators of properties we acquired or are currently operating or at sites where we sent materials for processing recycling or disposal as discussed in more detail in the next risk factor we have substantial obligations for environmental remediation on mining properties previously owned or operated by freeportmcmoran corporation fmc and certain of its affiliates some of our onshore california oil and gas fields have been in operation for more than 100 years and current or future legal requirements may impose substantial expenditures to remediate the properties or to otherwise comply with these requirements noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in material penalties or other liabilities in addition compliance with these laws may from time to time result in delays in or changes to our development or expansion plans compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs which we expect will continue to increase over time because of increased regulatory oversight adoption of increasingly stringent environmental standards as well as other factors 

for example under the clean air act epa recently lowered the national ambient air quality standards naaqs for sulfur dioxide the area around our smelter in miami arizona has sulfur dioxide levels in excess of the new standard and the smelter is the primary contributor to those levels as a result we are required to install pollution control equipment as part of an expansion that will allow the smelter to operate and comply with the new sulfur dioxide standard but will increase our operating cost 

in addition in response to the 2010 deepwater horizon incident in the gom the boembsee issued new guidelines and regulations regarding among other things environmental matters and decommissioning applicable to oil and gas drilling in the gom these regulations require among other things independent thirdparty inspections certification of well design and well control equipment and emergency response plans in the event of a blowout 

 60 

we also believe there has generally been more aggressive application of the endangered species act resulting in increases in the number of protected species and expansive designations of their critical habitat which may make obtaining federal permits and securing additional water resources more timeconsuming unpredictable and expensive 

new or revised environmental legal requirements are frequently proposed many of which result in substantially increased costs for our business for example epa has proposed rules that if effective would reclassify some mineral processing materials as hazardous waste under the federal resource conservation and recovery act which would reverse longstanding epa regulatory determinations and subject the industry to significant new and costly waste management requirements 

other regulation under consideration by environmental regulatory agencies include provisions that would impose additional restrictions on waterway discharges and land use and regulate environmental impacts of radioactive materials associated with mining operations and expand regulation of solid wastes among other things adoption of these or similar new environmental regulations or more stringent application of existing regulations may materially increase our costs and constrain our expansion opportunities 

during 2013 we incurred environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs including our joint venture partners shares to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect our operations of 595 million  compared with 612 million  in 2012  and 387 million  in 2011  for 2014  we expect to incur approximately 475 million  of aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs the timing and amounts of estimated payments could change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements changes in scope and costs of reclamation and plug and abandonment activities the settlement of environmental matters and as actual spending occurs 

we incur significant costs for remediating environmental conditions on mining properties that have not been operated in many years 

fmc and its subsidiaries and many of their affiliates and predecessor companies have been involved in exploration mining milling smelting and manufacturing in the us for more than a century activities that occurred in the late 19th century and the 20th century prior to the advent of modern environmental laws were not subject to environmental regulation and were conducted before american industrial companies fully understood the longterm effects of their operations on the surrounding environment with the passage of cercla in 1980 companies like fmc became legally responsible for the clean up of hazardous substances released into the environment from properties owned or operated by them including damages to natural resources irrespective of when the damage to the environment occurred or who caused it that liability is often shared on a joint and several basis with all other prior and subsequent owners and operators meaning that each owner or operator of the property is fully responsible for the cleanup although in many cases some or all of the other historical owners or operators no longer exist do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found as a result because of our acquisition of fmc in 2007 many of the subsidiary companies we now own are responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the us and we expect to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those remediation issues we are also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources at december 31 2013  we had more than 100  active remediation projects including damaged natural resource claims in 28  us states in addition fmc and certain affiliates and predecessor companies were parties to agreements relating to the transfer of businesses or properties which contained indemnification provisions relating to environmental matters and which from time to time become the source of claims against us 

at december 31 2013  we had 12 billion  recorded in our consolidated balance sheet for environmental obligations attributed to cercla or analogous state programs and for estimated future costs associated with environmental matters at closed facilities or closed portions of certain operating facilities our environmental obligation estimates are primarily based upon 

 

 61 

 

 

significant adjustments to these estimates are likely to occur in the future as additional information becomes available the actual environmental costs may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs and any such changes could be material 

in addition remediation standards for environmental media imposed by epa and state environmental agencies have generally become more stringent over time and may become more stringent in the future imposition of more stringent remediation standards poses a risk that additional remediation work could be required at sites that we have already remediated to the satisfaction of the responsible governmental agencies and may increase the risk of toxic tort litigation 

refer to note 12  for further discussion of our environmental obligations 

our indonesia mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges and future changes in environmental laws or unanticipated environmental impacts from those operations could require us to incur increased costs 

mining operations on the scale of our indonesia operations involve significant environmental risks and challenges our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of crushed and ground rock material called tailings that results from the process by which we physically separate the copper gold and silverbearing materials from the ore that we mine our tailings management plan which has been approved by the indonesian government uses the unnavigable river system in the highlands near our mine to transport the tailings to an engineered area in the lowlands where the tailings and natural sediments are managed in a deposition area lateral levees have been constructed to help contain the footprint of the tailings and to limit their impact in the lowlands 

another major environmental challenge is managing overburden which is the rock that must be moved aside in the mining process to reach the ore in the presence of air water and naturally occurring bacteria some overburden can generate acid rock drainage or acidic water containing dissolved metals that if not properly managed can adversely affect the environment 

from time to time certain indonesian government officials have raised questions with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans including a suggestion that we implement a pipeline system rather than the river transport system for tailings management and disposition because our indonesia mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area a pipeline system would be costly difficult to construct and maintain and more prone to catastrophic failure and could therefore involve significant potentially adverse environmental issues based on our own studies and others conducted by third parties we do not believe that a pipeline system is necessary or practical 

in connection with obtaining our environmental approvals from the indonesian government we committed to perform a onetime environmental risk assessment on the impacts of our tailings management plan we completed this extensive environmental risk assessment with more than 90 scientific studies conducted over four years and submitted it to the indonesian government in december 2002 we developed the risk assessment study using internationally recognized methods with input from an independent review panel which included representatives from the indonesian government academia and nongovernmental organizations the risks identified during this process were consistent with our impact projections of the tailings management program contained in our environmental approval documents 

since 2005 ptfi has participated in the indonesian governments proper program for pollution control evaluation and rating program ptfi received a blue rating for the last proper audit by the indonesian ministry of environment that audit was conducted in 2010 and the blue rating indicated that ptfis environmental management practices were in compliance with the laws and regulations of indonesia since then as allowed under environmental law 42009 the indonesian ministry of environment has continued to audit ptfi but not using the 

 62 

proper protocol which has proven to be impractical for the size of the ptfi operation there have been no compliance issues and the latest audit was in fourthquarter 2013 

mine closure regulations impose substantial costs on our operations   we also have plugging and abandonment obligations relating to our oil and gas operations 

our us mining operations are subject to various federal and state permitting requirements that include mine closure and minedland reclamation obligations these requirements are complex and vary depending upon the jurisdiction the laws govern the determination of the scope and cost of the closure and reclamation obligations and the amount and forms of financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to meet the obligations of those plans if we are unable to do so   in general our us mines are required to review estimated closure and reclamation costs on either a periodic basis or at the time of significant permit modifications and to post increasing amounts of financial assurance as required by state regulators it is uncertain how potential epa requirements for financial assurance will affect the timing of periodic closure cost reviews or the scope of closure activities 

in july 2011 the chilean senate passed legislation regulating mine closure which established new requirements for closure plans and became effective in november 2012 our chilean operations are required to update closure plans and provide financial assurance for these obligations revised closure plans for the chilean mine sites are due in november 2014 

cerro verde is subject to regulation under the mine closure law administered by the peruvian ministry of energy and mines under the closure regulations mines must submit a closure plan that includes the reclamation methods closure cost estimates methods of control and verification closure and postclosure plans and financial assurance an updated closure plan for the cerro verde mine expansion was submitted to the peruvian ministry of energy and mines in november 2013 

in december 2009 ptfi submitted its revised mine closure plan to the department of energy and mineral resources for review and has addressed comments received during the course of this review process in december 2010 the president of indonesia issued a regulation regarding mine reclamation and closure which requires a company to provide a mine closure guarantee in the form of a time deposit placed in a stateowned bank in indonesia in accordance with its cow ptfi is working with the department of energy and mineral resources to review these requirements including discussions of other options for the mine closure guarantee 

we cannot predict at this time the cost of these mine closure plans or the levels or forms of financial assurance that may be required which amounts could be substantial 

additionally substantially all of our oil and gas leases require that upon termination of economic production the working interest owners plug and abandon nonproducing wellbores remove equipment and facilities from leased acreage and restore land in accordance with applicable local state and federal laws 

at december 31 2013  we had asset retirement obligations aros of 23 billion  recorded in our consolidated balance sheet which included 11 billion  for our oil and gas operations aro cost estimates may increase or decrease significantly in the future as a result of changes in closure regulations changes in engineering designs and technology permit modifications or updates changes in mine plans inflation or other factors and as actual reclamation spending occurs refer to note 12  for further discussion 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change issues may increase our costs and adversely   affect our operations and markets 

many scientists believe that emissions from the combustion of carbonbased fuels contribute to greenhouse effects and therefore contribute to climate change carbonbased energy is a significant input in our operations and our revenues include significant sales of oil ngls and gas and other carbonbased energy products 

a number of governments have introduced or are contemplating regulatory initiatives designed to control and reduce greenhouse gas emissions many us states have taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases for example in california the california air resources board carb has developed cap and trade regulations pursuant to the california global warming solutions act of 2006 intended to achieve an overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels a 15 percent reduction by 2020 some of our operations in california are subject to these regulations which require us to purchase offsets and allowance instruments  ie   

 63 

equivalent units equal to one metric ton of emissions under the california global warming solutions act of 2006 the total amount of instruments we must purchase will vary annually while we do not expect these costs to be material similar or more onerous state regulations could substantially increase our costs 

in june 2010 the epa issued final regulations under the clean air act for the control of greenhouse gases from new large stationary sources and major modifications to existing large stationary sources this and other federal greenhouse gas regulations have been challenged in judicial proceedings certain of our operations including the miami smelter could be materially affected by these regulations if plant emissions exceed applicable thresholds in addition anticipated future epa regulations covering large fossil fuel fired power plants may materially increase energy costs at our operations the us may also become a party to international agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions which could lead to new regulations affecting our us operations 

from a medium and longterm perspective we may experience increased costs relating to our greenhouse gas emissions as a result of regulatory initiatives in the us and other countries in which we operate in addition the cost of electricity that we purchase from others may increase if our suppliers incur increased costs from the regulation of their greenhouse gas emissions although we have modeled different scenarios we cannot predict the magnitude of increased costs with any certainty given the wide scope of potential regulatory changes in the many countries in which we operate increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may also reduce demand for the oil and gas we produce 

the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would vary by operation based on particular geographic circumstances these may include changes in rainfall patterns water shortages changing sea levels changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperatures these effects may adversely affect the cost production and financial performance of our operations 

proposed federal state or local regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase our oil and gas operating and capital costs 

our oil and gas operations utilize hydraulic fracturing and other types of well stimulation hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate the flow of oil and gas hydraulic fracturing is necessary to produce commercial quantities of oil and gas from many reservoirs especially shale formations such as the haynesville and eagle ford shale plays 

the process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions and agencies and continues to receive significant regulatory and legislative attention at the federal state and local levels several proposals are before the us congress that if implemented would either prohibit or restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to more extensive regulations several states have adopted or are considering legislation to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices that could impose more stringent permitting transparency and well construction requirements on hydraulicfracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether in addition some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities andor hydraulic fracturing or are considering doing so 

although it is not possible to predict the final outcome of any legislation regarding hydraulic fracturing any new federal state or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing including those related to use of land and water that are enacted in areas where we conduct our oil and gas operations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions 

other risks 

unanticipated litigation or negative developments in pending litigation or with respect to other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are a party to the litigation and subject to other contingencies including those described in note 12  and in item 3 legal proceedings involving such matters as asbestos exposure cases disputes over the allocation of environmental remediation obligations at superfund and other sites claims of personal injury and property damage arising from environmental contamination disputes over water rights disputes over taxes and other disputes with regulatory authorities the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant monetary damages penalties or injunctive relief against us limitations on our property rights or regulatory interpretations that increase our operating costs if any of these disputes results in a substantial 

 64 

monetary judgment against us or is settled on unfavorable terms or otherwise affects our operations it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition a negative outcome in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we depend on our senior management team and other key employees and the loss of any of these employees could adversely affect our business 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract retain and motivate senior management and other key employees achieving this objective may be difficult because of many factors including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions competitors hiring practices cost reduction activities and the effectiveness of our compensation programs competition for qualified personnel can be very intense we must continue to recruit retain and motivate senior management and other key employees to maintain our current business and support our future projects a loss of such personnel could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and our operating results could be adversely affected 

our holding company structure may impact our stockholders ’  ability to receive dividends  

we are a holding company with no material assets other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries as a result our ability to repay our indebtedness and pay dividends is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend loan debt repayment or otherwise our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to make funds available to us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends dividends from subsidiaries that are not wholly owned are shared with other equity owners cash at our international operations is also subject to foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation into the us 

in addition our subsidiaries may not be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries assets upon their liquidation reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries creditors including any trade creditors 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult these provisions 

 

 

 

 

 

these provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by the board 

 65 

in addition because we are incorporated in delaware we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with or acquisition of us 

these provisions may deter an acquisition of us that might otherwise be attractive to stockholders

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in numerous legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business or are associated with environmental issues arising from legacy operations conducted over the years by freeportmcmoran corporation fmc and its affiliates we are also involved periodically in inquiries investigations and other proceedings initiated by or involving government agencies some of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief management does not believe based on currently available information that the outcome of any legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition although individual outcomes could be material to our operating results for a particular period depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period below is a discussion of our material water rights legal proceedings refer to note 12  for discussion of our other material legal proceedings 

water rights 

our operations in the western united states us require significant quantities of water for mining ore processing and related support facilities continuous operation of our mines is dependent on our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies in the arid western us water rights are often contested and disputes over water rights are generally timeconsuming expensive and not necessarily dispositive unless they resolve both actual and potential claims the loss of a water right loss of continued use of a currently available water supply or inability to expand our water resources could materially and adversely affect our mining operations by significantly increasing the cost of water forcing us to curtail operations preventing us from expanding operations or forcing premature closures thereby increasing andor accelerating costs and foregoing profitable operations 

at our north america operations certain of our water supplies are supported by surface water rights which give us the right to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location in arizona we are a participant in two active general stream adjudications in which for over 30 years the arizona courts have been attempting to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for two of the states largest river systems which affect four of our operating mines morenci safford sierrita and miami the legal precedent set in these proceedings may also affect our bagdad mine groundwater has historically been treated differently from surface water under arizona law which has generally allowed land owners to pump at will subject to the doctrine of reasonable use however court decisions in one of the adjudications have concluded that groundwater pumping may affect surface water thereby bringing the pumping within the jurisdiction of the general stream adjudications the effort to define the boundaries between groundwater and surface water remains contested however and is currently the principal focus of one of those adjudications because groundwater accounts for approximately 40 percent of arizonas water supplies the recharacterization of any significant portion of that water as surface water could jeopardize the ability of consumers farmers ranchers municipalities and industrial users like us to continue to access water supplies that have been relied on for decades because we are a significant user of groundwater in arizona we are an active participant in the adjudication proceedings 

in re the general adjudication of all rights to use water in the little colorado water system and sources  apache county superior court no 6417 filed on or about february 17 1978 the principal parties in addition to us include the state of arizona the salt river project the arizona public service company the navajo nation the hopi indian tribe the san juan southern paiute tribe and the us on behalf of those tribes on its own behalf and on behalf of the white mountain apache tribe this case involves adjudication of water rights claims including federal claims in the little colorado watershed 

 66 

in re the general adjudication of all rights to use water in the gila river system and sources  maricopa county superior court cause nos w1 salt w2 verde w3 upper gila and w4 san pedro this case was originally initiated in 1974 with the filing of a petition with the arizona state land department and was consolidated and transferred to the maricopa county superior court in 1981 the principal parties in addition to us include the state of arizona the gila valley irrigation district the franklin irrigation district the san carlos irrigation and drainage district the salt river project the san carlos apache tribe the gila river indian community gric and the us on behalf of those tribes on its own behalf and on behalf of the white mountain apache tribe the fort mcdowell mohaveapache indian community the salt river pimamaricopa indian community and the payson community of yavapai apache indians 

prior to january 1 1983 various indian tribes filed suits in the us district court in arizona claiming superior rights to water being used by many other water users including us and claiming damages for prior use in derogation of their allegedly superior rights these federal proceedings have been stayed pending the arizona superior court adjudications 

the maricopa county superior court issued a decision in 2005 in the gila river adjudication that directed the arizona department of water resources adwr to prepare detailed recommendations regarding the delineation of the “subflow” zone of the san pedro river basin a tributary of the gila river according to the court the subflow zone is the subsurface area adjacent to the river where the court may find that groundwater is connected to the surface water such that groundwater pumping may reduce surface flows although we have minimal interests in the san pedro river basin a decision that recharacterizes groundwater in that basin as surface water may set a precedent for other river systems in arizona that could have material implications for many commercial industrial municipal and agricultural users of groundwater including our arizona operations 

adwr produced its recommendations in june 2009 and those recommendations were objected to by numerous parties on both sides of the issue adwr responded to those objections in january 2011 following a threeday hearing held in late january 2012 at which various parties provided testimony and oral argument regarding the strengths and weaknesses of adwrs technical approach to characterizing underground flows as groundwater or surface water the court directed adwr to submit a further report detailing the additional work it deemed necessary to properly delineate the san pedro river basin subflow zone on october 12 2012 the court issued an order instructing adwr to conduct additional technical work and issue revised subflow zone maps for the san pedro river basin on october 17 2012 the arizona supreme court announced the appointment of a replacement for the judge who had presided over the case for more than 10 years as a result of his appointment to the federal bankruptcy court the new presiding judge is the fourth judge to preside over the case since its inception almost 40 years ago on january 10 2013 the new presiding judge heard oral arguments regarding the additional work to be performed by adwr in order to develop revised subflow zone maps for the san pedro river basin and issued an order instructing adwr to complete additional technical work and submit a new report by april 1 2014 given the legal and technical complexity of this adjudication its long history and its longterm legal economic and political implications it is difficult to predict the timing or the outcome of this issue or of the overall adjudication if we are unable to satisfactorily resolve the issues being addressed in this adjudication our ability to pump groundwater could be diminished or curtailed and our operations at morenci safford sierrita miami and bagdad could be adversely affected 

as part of the gila river adjudication the us has asserted numerous claims for federal nonindian reserved water rights throughout arizona these claims are based on reservations of federal land for specific purposes eg national parks military bases and wilderness areas unlike state lawbased water rights federal reserved water rights are not based on a history of beneficial use of specific amounts of water instead these rights are given priority in the prior appropriation system based on the date the land was reserved not the date that water was first used on the land as a result these water rights can be very disruptive to existing state lawbased water rights and uses particularly groundwater uses which are not assigned a priority date under state law 

because federal reserved water rights are not quantified the task of determining how much water each federal reservation may use has been left to the gila river adjudication court several “contested cases” to quantify reserved water rights for particular federal reservations are currently pending in the adjudication in multiple instances the us asserts a right to all water in a particular watershed that was not appropriated prior to the reservation this creates risks for both surface water users and groundwater users because such claims can severely impede current and future uses of water within the same watershed 

 67 

federal reserved rights present additional risks to water users aside from the significant quantities of water claimed by the us of particular significance federal reserved rights enjoy greater protection from groundwater pumping than is accorded to state lawbased water rights this means that the existence of a federal reserved right may threaten a groundwater user’s ability to continue pumping groundwater under circumstances in which a state lawbased right may pose no risk 

because there are numerous federal reservations in watersheds across arizona the reserved water right claims of the us pose a significant risk to multiple operations including morenci and safford in the upper gila river watershed sierrita in the santa cruz watershed and bagdad in the bill williams river watershed although the bill williams watershed is not part of the gila river adjudication decisions made in the gila river adjudication may be asserted as precedents for similar federal claims in the bill williams watershed because federal reserved water rights may adversely affect water uses at each of these operations we have been actively involved in litigation over these claims 




 item 4 mine safety disclosures 

the safety and health of all employees is our highest priority management believes that safety and health considerations are integral to and compatible with all other functions in the organization and that proper safety and health management will enhance production and reduce costs our approach towards the health and safety of our workforce is to continuously improve performance through implementing robust management systems and providing adequate training safety incentive and occupational health programs 

our objective is zero work place injuries and occupational illnesses we measure progress toward achieving our objective against regularly established benchmarks including measuring companywide total recordable incident rates trir during 2013 our trir including contractors was 074 per 200000 manhours worked compared to the preliminary metal mining sector industry average reported by the us mine safety and health administration msha for 2013 of 235 per 200000 manhours worked our trir including contractors was 058 per 200000 manhours worked in 2012  and 061 per 200000 manhours worked in 2011  compared to msha’s metal mining sector industry average of 225 per 200000 manhours worked in 2012  and 229 per 200000 manhours worked in 2011

copper gold and molybdenum 

a brief discussion of our primary metals appears below for further discussion of historical market prices of these metals refer to mda 

copper 

copper is an internationally traded commodity and its prices are determined by the major metals exchanges – the london metal exchange lme new york mercantile exchange comex and shanghai futures exchange shfe prices on these exchanges generally reflect the worldwide balance of copper supply and demand and can be volatile and cyclical during 2012  lme spot copper prices ranged from a low of 329  per pound to a high of 393  per pound averaged 361  per pound and closed at 359  per pound on december 31 2012  

in general demand for copper reflects the rate of underlying world economic growth particularly in industrial production and construction according to wood mackenzie a widely followed independent metals market consultant copper’s enduse markets and their estimated shares of total consumption are 



gold 

gold is used for jewelry coinage and bullion as well as various industrial and electronic applications gold can be readily sold on numerous markets throughout the world benchmark prices are generally based on london bullion market association london quotations during 2012  london pm gold prices ranged from a low of 1540  per ounce to a high of 1792  per ounce averaged 1669  per ounce and closed at 1658  per ounce on december 31 2012

enduse markets and their estimated shares of total consumption according to the international molybdenum association are 



reference prices for molybdenum are available in several publications including metals week  ryan’s notes  and metal bulletin  during 2012  the weekly average price of molybdenum quoted by metals week  ranged from a low of 1090  per pound to a high of 1480  per pound averaged 1274  per pound and was 1160  per pound on december 31 2012  

products and sales 

fcx’s consolidated revenues for 2012  primarily included sales of copper  79 percent  gold  10 percent  and molybdenum  7 percent  pt freeport indonesia’s sales to pt smelting pt freeport indonesias 25 percent owned copper smelter and refinery in indonesia  refer to smelting facilities for further discussion represented 11 percent  of our consolidated revenues in 2012  and 2011  and 12 percent  in 2010  no other customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated revenues in any of the past three years 

refer to note 17  for a summary of our consolidated revenues and operating income by business segment and geographic area 

copper products 

we are one of the world’s leading producers of copper concentrate cathode and continuous cast copper rod during 2012  46 percent  of our mined copper was sold in concentrate 28 percent  as cathode and 26 percent  as rod from our north america operations 

our copper ores are generally processed either by smelting and refining or by solution extraction and electrowinning sxew before being subject to the smelting and refining process ore is crushed and treated to produce a copper concentrate with copper content of approximately 20 to 30 percent copper concentrate is then smelted  ie  subjected to extreme heat to produce copper anodes which weigh between 800 and 900 pounds each and have an average copper content of 995 percent the anodes are further treated by electrolytic refining to produce copper cathodes which weigh between 100 and 350 pounds each and have an average copper content of 9999 percent our copper cathodes are used as the raw material input for copper rod brass mill products and for other uses for ore subject to the sxew process copper is extracted from the ore by dissolving it with a weak sulphuric acid solution the copper content of the solution is increased in two additional solutionextraction stages and then the copperbearing solution undergoes an electrowinning process to produce cathode that is 9999 percent copper 

copper concentrate  we produce copper concentrate at eight of our mines of which pt freeport indonesia is our largest producer in north america copper concentrate is produced at our morenci bagdad sierrita and chino mines and is generally shipped to our miami smelter in arizona in south america we produce copper concentrate at our cerro verde candelaria and ojos del salado mines 

copper cathode  we produce copper cathode at our electrolytic refinery located in el paso texas and at 10 of our mines in north america sxew cathode is produced from our morenci bagdad safford sierrita miami tyrone and chino mines in south america from our cerro verde and el abra mines and from our tenke mines in africa   atlantic copper slu atlantic copper our wholly owned copper smelting and refining unit in spain  refer to smelting facilities for further discussion and pt smelting also produce copper cathode

copper sales 

north america  the majority of the copper produced at our north america copper mines and refined in our el paso texas refinery is consumed at our rod plants the remainder of our north america copper production is sold in the form of copper cathode or copper concentrate under us dollardenominated annual contracts cathode and rod contract prices are generally based on the prevailing comex monthly average spot price for the month of shipment and include a premium generally copper rod is sold to wire and cable manufacturers while cathode is sold to rod brass or tube fabricators additionally during 2012  six percent of our north america mines copper sales volumes were shipped to atlantic copper 

south america    production from our south america mines is sold as copper concentrate or copper cathode under us dollardenominated annual and multiyear contracts our south america mines generally sell approximately 60 to 70 percent of their copper production in concentrate and the rest as cathode during 2012  15 percent of our south america mines copper sales volumes were shipped to atlantic copper 

substantially all of south america’s copper concentrate and cathode sales contracts provide final copper pricing in a specified future month generally one to four months from the shipment date primarily based on quoted lme monthly average spot copper prices revenues from south america’s concentrate sales are recorded net of treatment and refining charges  ie  fees paid to smelters and refiners that are generally negotiated annually including any applicable price participation charges that are based on the market price of copper in addition because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrates is unrecoverable from the smelting process revenues from south america’s concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances for unrecoverable metals which are a negotiated term of the contracts and vary by customer 

indonesia    pt freeport indonesia sells its production in the form of copper concentrate which contains significant quantities of gold and silver under us dollardenominated longterm contracts pt freeport indonesia also sells a small amount of copper concentrates in the spot market 

a summary of pt freeport indonesia’s aggregate percentage concentrate sales to pt smelting atlantic copper and to third parties for the last three years follows 



substantially all of pt freeport indonesias concentrate sales contracts provide final copper pricing in a specified future month generally one to four months from the shipment date primarily based on quoted lme monthly average spot copper prices revenues from pt freeport indonesias concentrate sales are recorded net of royalties treatment and refining charges and allowances for unrecoverable metals 

africa  tfm sells its production in the form of copper cathode under us dollardenominated contracts substantially all of tfms cathode sales provide final copper pricing in the month after the shipment date based on quoted lme monthly average spot copper prices revenues from tfms cathode sales are recorded net of royalties and also include adjustments for pointofsale transportation costs that are negotiated in customer contracts 

europe    atlantic copper sells copper cathode directly to rod and brass mills primarily located in europe atlantic copper has occasionally sold copper cathode to merchants copper cathode is generally sold under annual contracts and priced based on the lme monthly average spot price for the month of arrival at the buyer’s facilities 

our copper mining operations provide atlantic copper with at least half of its concentrate requirements at market prices 

following is a summary of atlantic coppers concentrate purchases from our copper mining operations and third parties for the last three years

grasberg crushing and conveying systems are integral to the mine and provide the capacity to transport up to 250000 metric tons per day of grasberg ore to the mill and 150000 metric tons per day of overburden to the overburden stockpiles the remaining overburden is moved by haul trucks 

doz underground mine 

the doz ore body lies vertically below the now depleted intermediate ore zone we began production from the doz ore body in 1989 using open stope mining methods but suspended production in 1991 in favor of production from the grasberg open pit production resumed in september 2000 using the blockcave method and is at the 3110meter elevation level production from the doz mine averaged 44600  metric tons of ore per day for the year 2012   51200  metric tons of ore per day in fourthquarter   2012  and is expected to ramp up to the design rate of 80000 metric tons of ore per day in 2013 following completion of ongoing panel repairs resulting from the temporary shutdown and suspension of operations in fourthquarter 2011 and early 2012 production at the doz mine is expected to continue through 2019 

the doz mine fleet consists of over 200 pieces of mobile heavy equipment which is capable of mining an average of 80000 metric tons of material per day the primary mining equipment directly associated with production and development includes an available fleet of 44 lhd units and 20 haul trucks each production lhd unit typically carry approximately 11 metric tons of ore using ore passes and chutes the lhd units transfer ore into 55metric ton capacity haul trucks the trucks dump into two gyratory crushers and the ore is then conveyed to the surface stockpiles for processing 

during 2012  we completed over 1600 meters of development drifting in support of the blockcave mining method for the doz mine the success of the development of the doz mine one of the world’s largest underground mines provides confidence in the future development of pt freeport indonesia’s largescale undeveloped underground ore bodies 

big gossan underground mine 

the big gossan mine lies underground and adjacent to the current mill site it is a tabular near vertical ore body with approximate dimensions of 1200 meters along strike and 800 meters down dip with varying thicknesses from 20 meters to 120 meters the mine utilizes a blasthole stoping method with delayed paste backfill stopes of varying sizes are mined and the ore dropped down passes to a truck haulage level trucks are chute loaded and transport the ore to a jaw crusher the crushed ore is then hoisted vertically via a twoskip production shaft to a level where it is loaded onto a conveyor belt the belt carries the ore to one of the main underground conveyors where the ore is transferred and conveyed to the surface stockpiles for processing 

the big gossan mine averaged 1600  metric tons of ore per day for the year 2012   2100  metric tons of ore per day in fourthquarter 2012  and is expected to ramp up to full rates of 7000 metric tons of ore per day in 2014 

big gossan has over 70 pieces of mobile heavy equipment which includes 11 loaders and 8 trucks used in development and production activities 

description of ore bodies   our indonesia ore bodies are located within and around two main igneous intrusions the grasberg monzodiorite and the ertsberg diorite the host rocks of these ore bodies include both carbonate and clastic rocks that form the ridge crests and upper flanks of the sudirman range and the igneous rocks of monzonitic to dioritic composition that intrude them the igneoushosted ore bodies the grasberg open pit and block cave and portions of the doz block cave occur as vein stockworks and disseminations of copper sulfides dominated by chalcopyrite and to a lesser extent bornite the sedimentaryrock hosted ore bodies portions of the doz and all of the big gossan occur as “magnetiterich calciummagnesian skarn” replacements whose location and orientation are strongly influenced by major faults and by the chemistry of the carbonate rocks along the margins of the intrusions 

the copper mineralization in these skarn deposits is dominated by chalcopyrite but higher bornite concentrations are common moreover gold occurs in significant concentrations in all of the district’s ore bodies though rarely visible to the naked eye these gold concentrations usually occur as inclusions within the copper sulfide minerals though in some deposits these concentrations can also be strongly associated with pyrite 

the following diagram indicates the relative elevations in meters of our reported ore bodies 

the following map which encompasses an area of approximately 42 square kilometers approximately 16 square miles indicates the relative positions and sizes of our reported ore bodies and their locations

we have several projects and potential opportunities to expand production volumes extend mine lives and develop largescale underground ore bodies our nearterm major development projects which will require substantial additional capital investment are presented below also refer to mda for further discussion of these projects our other development projects and exploration activities 

considering the longterm nature and large size of our development projects actual costs and timing could vary from estimates we continue to review our mine development and processing plans to maximize the value of our reserves 

morenci  we are engaged in a project to expand mining and milling capacity at morenci to process additional sulfide ores identified through exploratory drilling the approximate 14 billion project is targeting incremental annual production of approximately 225 million pounds of copper in 2014 through an increase in milling rates from 50000 metric tons of ore per day to 115000 metric tons of ore per day and mining rates from 700000 short tons per day 635000 metric tons per day to 900000 short tons per day  815000  metric tons per day engineering activities are progressing and construction activities are under way 

twin buttes  in december 2009 we purchased the twin buttes copper mine which ceased operations in 1994 and is adjacent to our sierrita mine the purchase provides significant synergies in the sierrita minerals district including the potential for expanded mining activities and access to material that can be used for sierrita tailings and stockpile reclamation purposes we are conducting drilling on the property and metallurgical studies to support a feasibility study expected to commence in 2013 

cerro verde  we are engaged in a largescale expansion at cerro verde the approximate 44 billion project would expand the concentrator facilities from 120000 metric tons of ore per day to 360000 metric tons of ore per day and provide incremental annual production of approximately 600 million pounds of copper and 15 million pounds of molybdenum beginning in 2016 cerro verde received approval of the environmental impact assessment in fourthquarter 2012 detailed engineering and procurement of longlead items are under way and construction is expected to commence in 2013 

el abra  we are engaged in prefeasibility studies for a potential largescale milling operation at el abra to process additional sulfide material and to achieve higher recoveries exploration results at el abra have identified a significant sulfide resource 

grasberg  we have several projects in progress in the grasberg minerals district primarily related to the development of largescale highgrade underground ore bodies located beneath and nearby the grasberg open pit in aggregate these ore bodies are expected to ramp up over several years to approximately 240000 metric tons of ore per day following the currently anticipated transition from the grasberg open pit in 2017 development of the deep mill level zone dmlz is advancing the dmlz is expected to commence production in 2015 and the grasberg block cave mine is scheduled to commence production in 2017 over the next five years estimated aggregate capital spending on these projects is currently expected to average 715 million per year 565 million per year net to pt freeport indonesia refer to mda for further discussion of these projects and the common infrastructure project 

in addition to the nearterm development projects in progress in the grasberg minerals district we also have an additional longterm underground mine development project in the grasberg minerals district for the kucing liar ore body which lies on the southern flank of and underneath the southern portion of the grasberg open pit at the 2605meter elevation level we expect to mine the kucing liar ore body using the blockcave method aggregate capital cost estimates for development of the kucing liar ore body are projected to approximate 2 billion which are expected to be made between 2019 and 2031 additionally our current mine development plans include approximately 3 billion of capital expenditures at our processing facilities to optimize the handling of underground ore types once the grasberg openpit operations cease we expect substantially all of these expenditures to be made between 2016 and 2034 

smelting facilities 

atlantic copper  our wholly owned atlantic copper smelter and refinery is located on land concessions from the huelva spain port authorities which expire in 2027 

the design capacity of the smelter is approximately 300000 metric tons of copper per year and the refinery currently has a capacity of 285000 metric tons of copper per year during 2012  atlantic copper treated approximately 11 million metric tons of concentrate and scrap and produced 295200 metric tons of copper anodes from its smelter and 274400 metric tons of copper cathodes from its refinery 

in may 2011 atlantic copper successfully completed a scheduled 26day maintenance turnaround major maintenance turnarounds which take approximately 50 days to complete typically are expected to occur approximately every eight years for atlantic copper with shortterm maintenance turnarounds in the interim the next longterm maintenance turnaround is scheduled for the second half of 2013 

we made no capital contributions to atlantic copper in 2012 and 202 million in 2011 no capital contributions were made for the years 2005 through 2010 we also loan funds to atlantic copper from time to time at december 31 2012  loans to atlantic copper totaled 434 million  

pt smelting  pt freeport indonesia’s 1991 cow required us to construct or cause to be constructed a smelter in indonesia if we and the indonesian government determined that such a project would be economically viable in 1995 following the completion of a feasibility study we entered into agreements relating to the formation of pt smelting an indonesian company and the construction of the copper smelter and refinery in gresik indonesia pt smelting owns and operates the smelter and refinery pt freeport indonesia mitsubishi materials corporation mitsubishi materials mitsubishi corporation unimetals ltd mitsubishi and jx nippon mining  metals corporation nippon own 25 percent 605 percent 95 percent and 5 percent respectively of the outstanding pt smelting common stock 

pt freeport indonesia’s contract with pt smelting provides for the supply of 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements subject to a minimum or maximum rate necessary for pt smelting to produce 205000 metric tons of copper annually on a priority basis pt freeport indonesia also sells copper concentrate to pt smelting at market rates for quantities in excess of 205000 metric tons of copper annually refer to note 2 for further discussion of our investment in pt smelting 

during 2012  pt smelting treated 855500 metric tons of concentrate and produced 198400 metric tons of copper anodes from its smelter and 197200 metric tons of copper cathodes from its refinery 

in may 2012 pt smelting completed a scheduled 30day maintenance turnaround major maintenance turnarounds which range from two weeks to a month to complete typically are expected to occur approximately every two years for pt smelting with significantly shorter term maintenance turnarounds in the interim the next major maintenance turnaround is scheduled for 2014 

miami smelter  we own and operate a smelter at our miami arizona mining operation the smelter has been in production for approximately 100 years and has been upgraded numerous times during that period to implement new technologies to improve production and to comply with air quality requirements additionally new air quality regulations for sulphur dioxide emissions will require the miami smelter to implement additional new technologies to meet these requirements or limit its operations refer to item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

the miami smelter processes copper concentrate primarily from our arizona copper mines concentrate processed through the smelter totaled approximately 620000 metric tons in 2012  in addition because sulphuric acid is a byproduct of smelting concentrates the miami smelter is also the most significant source of sulphuric acid for our north america leaching operations 

major maintenance turnarounds which take approximately three weeks to complete typically occur approximately every 14 months for the miami smelter with shorter term maintenance turnarounds in the interim

sources and availability of raw materials 

our copper mining operations require significant energy principally diesel electricity coal and natural gas most of which is obtained from third parties under longterm contracts energy represented approximately 21 percent  of our 2012  consolidated copper production costs and included purchases of approximately 255 million  gallons of diesel fuel 6800  gigawatt hours of electricity at our north america south america and africa copper mining operations we generate all of our power at our indonesia mining operation 700 thousand  metric tons of coal for our coal power plant in indonesia and 1 million  mmbtu million british thermal units of natural gas at certain of our north america mines for 2013  we estimate energy costs will approximate 21 percent  of our consolidated copper production costs 

sulphuric acid is used in the sxew process and is produced as a byproduct of the smelting process at our smelters and from our sulphur burners at the safford and tenke mines sulphuric acid needs in excess of the sulphuric acid produced by our operations are purchased from third parties 

our mining operations also require significant quantities of water for mining ore processing and related support facilities although we believe our mining operations have sufficient water rights the loss of water rights for any of our mines in whole or in part or shortages of water to which we have rights could require us to curtail or shut down mining operations for a further discussion of risks and legal proceedings associated with the availability of water refer to item 1a “risk factors” and item 3 “legal proceedings” 

competition 

the top 10 producers of copper comprise approximately 50 percent of total worldwide mined copper production we currently rank second among those producers at approximately eight percent of total worldwide estimated mined copper production our competitive position is based on the quality and grade of our ore bodies and our ability to manage costs compared with other producers we have a diverse portfolio of mining operations with varying ore grades and cost structures our costs are driven by the location grade and nature of our ore bodies and the level of input costs including energy labor and equipment the metals markets are cyclical and our ability to maintain our competitive position over the long term is based on our ability to acquire and develop quality deposits hire and retain a skilled workforce and to manage our costs 

labor matters

environmental and reclamation matters 

the cost of complying with environmental laws is a fundamental and substantial cost of our business for information about environmental regulation litigation and related costs refer to item 1a “risk factors” and notes 1 and 13  

community and human rights 

we have adopted policies that govern our working relationships with the communities where we operate and are designed to guide our practices and programs in a manner that respects basic human rights and the culture of the local people impacted by our operations we continue to make significant expenditures on community development education training and cultural programs which include 

 

in december 2000 we endorsed the joint us state departmentbritish foreign office voluntary principles on human rights and security voluntary principles several major natural resources companies and international human rights organizations participated in developing the voluntary principles and have endorsed them we participated in developing these principles and they are incorporated into our human rights policy 

we are assessing how to best integrate the united nations guiding principles on business and human rights into our existing human rights policy we joined a multiindustry human rights working group to help us learn from peer companies and determine the best way to integrate human rights due diligence into our business practices and to support our voluntary principles program 

we believe that our social and economic development programs are responsive to the issues raised by the local communities near our areas of operation and should help us maintain good relations with the surrounding communities and avoid disruptions of mining operations as part of our ongoing annual commitment to sustainable community development we have made significant investments in social programs including inkind support and administration across our global operations over the last three years these investments have averaged approximately 180 million per year nevertheless social and political instability in the areas of our operations may adversely impact our mining operations refer to item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

south america  cerro verde has provided a variety of community support projects over the years following engagements with regional and local governments civic leaders and development agencies in 2006 cerro verde committed to support the costs for a new potable water treatment plant to serve arequipa in addition an agreement was reached with the peruvian government for development of a water storage and distribution network which was financed by the cerro verde civil association the association the association manages contributions made by cerro verde for projects that focus on education training health cultural preservation and basic infrastructure 

in 2011 cerro verde reached agreement with the regional government of arequipa the national government sedapar and other local institutions to allow it to finance the engineering and construction of a wastewater treatment plant for arequipa should cerro verde proceed with plans for the largescale expansion treating this water would improve the rio chilis water quality enhance agriculture products grown in the area and reduce waterborne illnesses 

additionally during 2006 the peruvian government announced that all mining companies operating in peru would be required to make annual contributions to local development funds for a fiveyear period covering the years 2006 through 2010 when copper prices exceeded certain levels that were adjusted annually the contribution which expired in 2010 was equal to 375 percent of aftertax profits 

indonesia  in 1996 pt freeport indonesia established the freeport partnership fund for community development the partnership fund through which pt freeport indonesia has made available funding and technical assistance to support community development initiatives in the areas of health education and economic development of the area pt freeport indonesia has committed through 2016 to provide one percent of its annual revenue for the development of the local people in its area of operation through the partnership fund our share of contributions to the partnership fund totaled 39 million  in 2012  50 million  in 2011  and 64 million  in 2010  

the amungme and kamoro community development organization  lembaga pembangunan masyarakat amungme dan kamoro  or lpmak oversees disbursement of the program funds we contribute to the partnership fund lpmak is governed by a board of commissioners and a board of directors which are comprised of representatives from the local amungme and kamoro tribal communities government leaders church leaders and one representative of pt freeport indonesia on each board the amungme and kamoro people are original inhabitants of the land in our area of operations 

security matters    consistent with our cow in indonesia and the requirement to protect our employees and property we have taken appropriate steps to provide a safe and secure working environment as part of its security program pt freeport indonesia maintains its own internal security department which is unarmed and performs functions such as protecting company facilities monitoring shipments of supplies and products assisting in traffic control and aiding in emergency response operations the security department has received human rights training and each member is required to certify his or her compliance with our human rights policy 

pt freeport indonesia’s share of costs for its internal civilian security department totaled 52 million for 2012  37 million for 2011  and 28 million for 2010  

pt freeport indonesia and all businesses and residents of indonesia rely on the indonesian government for the maintenance of public order upholding the rule of law and the protection of personnel and property the grasberg minerals district has been designated by the indonesian government as one of indonesia’s vital national assets this designation results in the police and to a lesser extent the military playing a significant role in protecting the area of our operations the indonesian government is responsible for employing police and military personnel and directing their operations 

from the outset of pt freeport indonesia’s operations the indonesian government has looked to pt freeport indonesia to provide logistical and infrastructure support and assistance for these necessary services because of the limited resources of the indonesian government and the remote location of and lack of development in papua pt freeport indonesia’s financial support for the indonesian government security institutions assigned to the operations area represents a prudent response to its requirements to protect its workforce and property better 

ensuring that personnel are properly fed and lodged and have the logistical resources to patrol pt freeport indonesia’s roads and secure its operating area in addition the provision of such support is consistent with pt freeport indonesia’s obligations under the cow reflects our philosophy of responsible corporate citizenship and is in keeping with our commitment to pursue practices that will promote human rights 

pt freeport indonesia’s share of support costs for the governmentprovided security was 22 million in 2012  and 14 million for each of the years 2011  and 2010  this supplemental support consists of various infrastructure and other costs such as food housing fuel travel vehicle repairs allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs and community assistance programs conducted by the military and police 

refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion of security risks in indonesia 

africa  tfm has committed to assist the communities living within its concession in the katanga province of the drc initiatives include an integrated malaria control program construction and operational support for six elementary schools as well as renovation and construction of an additional four schools installation of over 70 clean water wells a public sanitation latrines and hand washing program reaching over 2000 households a mobile clinic for rural villages and economic development programs supporting microcredit and development of local entrepreneurs contractors and farmers we have also made significant investments in infrastructure in the region that will have lasting benefits to the country including upgrading a portion of a national road and the regional power generation and transmission systems 

tfm has also committed to contribute 03 percent of net sales revenue from production to a community development fund to assist the local communities with development of local infrastructure and related services this fund will be a platform to work jointly with the local government and community to further assist them to fulfill their local development plans meet basic community needs and promote good governance community development fund contributions totaled 4 million  in both 2012  and 2011  and 3 million  in 2010  

security matters  tfm maintains an unarmed internal security department the national government also has assigned mines police to the tfm concession area the mines police are a division of the congolese national police and are responsible for maintaining security in mining concessions throughout the drc tfm provides food housing monetary allowances and logistical support as well as direct payments to the government for the provision of the security assigned to the concession area the total cost to tfm for this support including inkind support totaled less than 1 million in each of the years 2012  2011  and 2010  

tfm also participates in monthly security coordination meetings with host country security personnel other mining companies and representatives from the united nations to discuss security issues and concerns 

ore reserves 

recoverable proven and probable reserves summarized below and detailed on the following pages have been calculated as of december 31 2012  in accordance with industry guide 7 as required by the securities exchange act of 1934 proven and probable reserves may not be comparable to similar information regarding mineral reserves disclosed in accordance with the guidance of other countries proven and probable reserves were determined by the use of mapping drilling sampling assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry as more fully discussed below the term “reserve” as used in the reserve data presented here means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination the term “proven reserves” means reserves for which 1 quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops trenches workings or drill holes 2 grade andor quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and 3 the sites for inspection sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established the term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced the degree of assurance although lower than that for proven reserves is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 

our reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies we conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk we revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies our estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves are prepared by and are the responsibility of our employees a majority of these estimates are reviewed and verified by independent experts in mining geology and reserve determination 

estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves at december 31 2012  were determined using longterm average prices of 200  per pound for copper 750  per ounce for gold and 10  per pound for molybdenum consistent with the longterm average prices used at yearend 2011  and 2010  for the threeyear period ended december 31 2012  lme spot copper prices averaged 367  per pound london pm gold prices averaged 1480  per ounce and the weekly average price of molybdenum quoted by metals week  averaged 1464  per pound 

the recoverable proven and probable reserves presented in the table below represent the estimated metal quantities from which we expect to be paid after application of estimated metallurgical recovery rates and smelter recovery rates where applicable recoverable reserves are the part of a mineral deposit that we estimate can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination

in defining our openpit reserves we apply a “variable cutoff grade” strategy the objective of this strategy is to maximize the net present value of our operations we use a breakeven cutoff grade to define the insitu reserves for our underground ore bodies the breakeven cutoff grade is defined for a metric ton of ore as that equivalent copper grade once produced and sold that generates sufficient revenue to cover all operating and administrative costs associated with our production 

our copper mines may contain other commercially recoverable metals such as gold molybdenum silver and cobalt we value all commercially recoverable metals in terms of a copper equivalent percentage to determine a single cutoff grade copper equivalent percentage is used to express the relative value of multimetal ores in terms of one metal the calculation expresses the relative value of the ore using estimates of contained metal quantities metals prices as used for reserve determination recovery rates treatment charges and royalties our molybdenum properties use a molybdenum cutoff grade 

the table below shows the minimum cutoff grade by process for each of our existing ore bodies as of december 31 2012  



drill hole spacing data is used by mining professionals such as geologists and geological engineers in determining the suitability of data coverage on a relative basis in a given deposit type and mining method scenario so as to achieve a given level of confidence in the resource estimate drill hole spacing is only one of several criteria necessary to establish resource classification drilling programs are typically designed to achieve an optimum sample spacing to support the level of confidence in results that apply to a particular stage of development of a mineral deposit 

the following table sets forth the average drill hole spacing based on average sample distance or drill pattern spacing for proven and probable ore reserves by process type 



production sequencing 

the following chart illustrates our current plans for sequencing and producing our proven and probable reserves at each of our ore bodies and the years in which we currently expect production from each ore body the chart also shows the term of pt freeport indonesia’s cow production volumes are typically lower in the first few years for each ore body as development activities are ongoing and as the mine ramps up to full production and production volumes may also be lower as the mine reaches the end of its life the ultimate timing of the start of production from our undeveloped mines is dependent upon a number of factors including the results of our exploration and development efforts and may vary from the dates shown below in addition we develop our mine plans based on maximizing the net present value from the ore bodies significant additional capital expenditures will be required at many of these mines in order to achieve the lifeofmine plans reflected below 

mill and leach stockpiles 

mill and leach stockpiles generally contain lower grade ores that have been extracted from the ore body and are available for copper recovery for mill stockpiles recovery is through milling concentrating smelting and refining or alternatively by concentrate leaching for leach stockpiles recovery is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities 

because it is generally impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count reasonable estimation methods are employed the quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grades of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles 

expected copper recovery rates for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing the recoverable copper in mill stockpiles once entered into the production process can be produced into copper concentrate almost immediately 

expected copper recovery rates for leach stockpiles are determined using smallscale laboratory tests small to largescale column testing which simulates the productionscale process historical trends and other factors including mineralogy of the ore and rock type ultimate recovery of copper contained in leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low percentage to more than 90 percent depending on several variables including type of copper recovery mineralogy and particle size of the rock for newly placed material on active stockpiles as much as 70 percent of the copper ultimately recoverable may be extracted during the first year and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years 

processes and recovery rates are monitored continuously and recovery rate estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes 

following are our stockpiles and the estimated recoverable copper contained within those stockpiles as of december 31 2012  

 

mineralized material 

we hold various properties containing mineralized material that we believe could be brought into production should market conditions warrant however permitting and significant capital expenditures would be required before operations could commence at these properties mineralized material is a mineralized body that has been delineated by appropriately spaced drilling andor underground sampling to support the reported tonnage and average metal grades such a deposit cannot qualify as recoverable proven and probable reserves until legal and economic feasibility are confirmed based upon a comprehensive evaluation of development costs unit costs grades recoveries and other material factors estimated mineralized materials as presented on the following page were assessed using prices of 220  per pound for copper 1000  per ounce for gold and 12  per pound for molybdenum

financial risks 

extended declines in the market prices of copper gold andor molybdenum could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows and if sustained could adversely affect our ability to repay debt fluctuations in the market prices of copper gold or molybdenum can cause significant volatility in our financial performance and adversely affect the trading prices of our debt and common stock 

our financial results vary with fluctuations in metal market prices including copper gold and molybdenum for further information about the market prices of these commodities refer to discussion below and in item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” an extended decline in the market prices of these commodities could adversely affect our financial results or our ability to repay our debt and meet our other fixed obligations and depress the trading prices of our common stock and of our publicly traded debt securities 

additionally if market prices for the metals we produce decline for a sustained period of time we may have to revise our operating plans including curtailing production reducing operating costs and capital expenditures and discontinuing certain exploration and development programs we may be unable to decrease our costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues and may incur losses 

substantially all of our copper concentrate and cathode sales contracts provide final copper pricing in a specified future month generally one to four months from the shipment date based primarily on quoted london metal exchange lme monthly average spot copper prices accordingly in times of rising copper prices our revenues benefit from adjustments to the final pricing of provisionally priced sales pursuant to contracts entered into in prior periods in times of falling copper prices the opposite occurs 

copper prices have fluctuated historically with lme spot copper prices ranging from a low of 276  to a high of 460 per pound during the three years ended december 31 2012  copper prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gold prices have also fluctuated historically with the london pm gold price ranging from a low of 1058  to a high of 1895  per ounce during the three years ended december 31 2012  gold prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

molybdenum prices also fluctuate with the metals week molybdenum dealer oxide weekly average price ranging from a low of 1090  to a high of 1860  per pound during the three years ended december 31 2012  molybdenum prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under us federal and state laws that require closure and reclamation plans for our mines we generally are required to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement those plans if we are unable to do so the us environmental protection agency epa and state agencies may also seek financial assurance for investigation and remediation actions under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or equivalent state regulations   the failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us 

we are required by us federal and state laws to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans if we are unable to do so these laws are complex and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction the laws govern the determination of the scope and cost of the closure and reclamation obligations and the amount and forms of financial assurance epa and state agencies may also seek financial assurance for investigation and remediation actions under cercla or equivalent state regulations 

in july 2009 epa published a priority notice of action identifying classes of facilities within the hardrock mining industry for which the agency will develop financial responsibility requirements consistent with the degree and duration of risk associated with the production transportation treatment storage or disposal of hazardous substances in epas semiannual regulatory agenda published on january 8 2013 epa indicated that it intends to propose regulations regarding hardrock mining financial responsibility in may 2014 it is uncertain how the new requirements if promulgated will affect the amount and form of our existing and future financial assurance obligations 

the amount of financial assurance we are required to provide will vary with changes in laws regulations and reclamation and closure requirements and cost estimates as of december 31 2012  our financial assurance obligations associated with closure and reclamation costs totaled 970 million  of which 601 million  was in the form of parent company guarantees and financial capability demonstrations our ability to continue to provide financial assurance in the form of parent guarantees and financial capability demonstrations depends on our ability to meet financial tests certain of the ratios in these tests are significantly more rigorous for companies that do not have an investment grade rating from a stateapproved ratings service we are currently rated investment grade by standard  poors rating services sp fitch ratings and moodys investors service moodys if we fail to maintain our investment grade rating we would be subject to these more rigorous tests in which case the regulatory agencies may require us to provide alternative forms of financial assurance such as letters of credit surety bonds or collateral depending on our financial condition and market conditions these other forms of financial assurance may be difficult or costly to provide issuance of letters of credit under our credit facilities would reduce our available liquidity failure to provide the required financial assurance could result in the closure of mines as of december 31 2012  we had limited financial assurance obligations associated with cerclarelated remediation obligations although epa and certain states are increasing the use of financial assurance requirements for such obligations   

for additional information and for discussion of mine closure laws impacting our international operations refer to the environmental risk factor mine closure regulations impose substantial costs on our operations 

movements in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively affect our operating results 

the functional currency for most of our operations is the us dollar all of our revenues and a significant portion of our costs are denominated in us dollars however some costs and certain asset and liability accounts are denominated in local currencies including the indonesian rupiah australian dollar chilean peso peruvian nuevo sol euro and south african rand generally our results are positively affected when the us dollar strengthens in relation to those foreign currencies and adversely affected when the us dollar weakens in relation to those foreign currencies refer to item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for a summary of the estimated impact of changes in foreign currency rates on our annual operating costs 

from time to time we may implement currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange however our hedging strategies may not be successful and any of our unhedged foreign exchange payments will continue to be subject to market fluctuations 

international risks 

our international operations are subject to political social and geographic risks of doing business in foreign countries 

we are a global mining company with substantial assets located outside of the us we conduct international mining operations in indonesia peru chile and the democratic republic of congo drc accordingly in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in foreign countries our business may be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties in each of these countries such risks include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our insurance does not cover most losses caused by the above described risks accordingly our exploration development and production activities outside of the us could be substantially affected by factors beyond our control some of which could materially and adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 

our international operations must comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption and antibribery laws of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate there has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of these laws although we have a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of violations of such laws any violation could result in significant criminal or civil sanctions 

we are involved in several significant tax proceedings and other tax matters with the indonesian and peruvian tax authorities refer to note 13  for further discussion of these matters 

because our grasberg minerals district is our most significant operating asset our business may continue to be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties and security risks in indonesia 

indonesia has faced political and social uncertainties including separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces in particular several separatist groups are opposing indonesian rule over the province of papua where our grasberg minerals district is located and have sought political independence for the province in response indonesia enacted regional autonomy laws which became effective january 1 2001 the manner in which those laws are being implemented and the degree of political and economic autonomy that they may bring to individual provinces including papua are uncertain and are ongoing issues in indonesian politics in papua there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the indonesian military social economic and political instability in papua could materially and adversely affect us if it results in damage to our property or interruption of our activities 

maintaining a good working relationship with the indonesian government is important to us because our mining operations there are among indonesias most significant business enterprises and are conducted pursuant to a contract of work cow with the indonesian government partially because of their significance to indonesias economy the environmentally sensitive area in which they are located and the number of people employed our operations are occasionally the subject of criticism in the indonesian press and in political debates and have been the target of protests and occasional violence 

between july 2009 and february 15 2013  there were 37  shooting incidents in and around the grasberg minerals district including along the road leading to our mining and milling operations which resulted in 15  fatalities and 57 

injuries the investigation of these matters is continuing we have taken precautionary measures including limiting the use of the roads to secured convoys the indonesian government has responded with additional security forces and expressed a commitment to protect the safety of the community and our operations prolonged limitations on access to the road could adversely affect operations at the mine the safety of our workforce is a critical concern and pt freeport indonesia is working cooperatively with the indonesian government to address security issues 

during 2011 pt freeport indonesia was adversely affected by labor disruptions including an eightday work stoppage in july 2011 and an approximate threemonth strike that concluded in december 2011 the strike involved civil unrest transportation blockades sabotage of important operating facilities and violence additionally during firstquarter 2012 pt freeport indonesia experienced work interruptions in connection with its efforts to resume normal operations and temporarily suspended operations 

large numbers of illegal miners have continued to operate along the river used to transport the tailings from the mill to the lowlands in pt freeport indonesias governmentapproved tailings management area the illegal miners have periodically clashed with police who have attempted to move them away from our facilities in 2006 the illegal miners temporarily blocked the road leading to the grasberg mine and mill in protest and pt freeport indonesia temporarily suspended mining and milling operations as a precautionary measure 

we cannot predict whether additional incidents will occur that could disrupt or suspend our indonesian operations if additional violence or other disruptive incidents occur it could adversely affect our business and profitability in ways that we cannot predict at this time 

we will not mine all of our ore reserves in indonesia before the initial term of our cow expires 

pt freeport indonesia is entitled to mine in indonesia under its cow with the indonesian government the initial term of the current cow expires in 2021 but can be extended for two 10year periods subject to indonesian government approval which pursuant to the cow cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably our proven and probable ore reserves in indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041 and our current mine plan has been developed and our operations are based on the assumption that we will receive the two 10year extensions as a result we will not mine all of these ore reserves during the initial term of the current cow and there can be no assurance that the indonesian government will approve the extensions prior to the end of 2021 we expect to mine 28 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable ore at december 31 2012  representing 34 percent of pt freeport indonesias share of recoverable copper reserves and 46 percent of its share of recoverable gold reserves 

we have had discussions with the indonesian government regarding the implications of the 2009 mining law and are working cooperatively to complete the governments contract of work evaluation process and to obtain an extension of the cow beyond 2021 as provided under the terms of the cow refer to part i items 1 and 2 business and properties  mines indonesia for further discussion the outcome of these discussions may result in revisions to certain terms of the cow 

our cows in indonesia are subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations and if a dispute arises we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel 

pt freeport indonesias cow and other cows in which we have an interest were entered into under indonesias 1967 foreign capital investment law which provides guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization our cows can be terminated by the indonesia government if we do not satisfy our contractual obligations which include the payment of royalties and taxes to the government and the satisfaction of certain mining environmental safety and health requirements 

certain forestry laws and designations as well as prevailing environmental laws and regulations may conflict with or overlap with the mining rights established under our cow although our cow grants to pt freeport indonesia the unencumbered right to operate in accordance with the cow certain government agencies could seek to impose additional restrictions on pt freeport indonesia that could affect exploration and operating requirements 

at times certain government officials and others in indonesia have questioned the validity of contracts entered into by the indonesian government prior to may 1998  ie  during the suharto regime which lasted over 30 years including pt freeport indonesias cow which was signed in december 1991 we cannot provide assurance that the validity of or our compliance with the cows will not be challenged for political or other reasons pt freeport indonesias cow and our other cows require that disputes with the indonesian government be submitted to international arbitration accordingly if a dispute arises under the cows we face the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel and if we prevail in such a dispute we will face the additional risk of having to enforce the judgment of a foreign court or arbitration panel against indonesia within its own territory 

the tenke fungurume minerals district is located in the katanga province of the drc and may be adversely affected by security risks and political economic and social instability in the drc 

during 2009 we completed construction activities and commenced copper and cobalt production at the tenke fungurume tenke mine located in the drc since gaining independence in 1960 the drc has undergone outbreaks of violence changes in national leadership and financial crises these factors heighten the risk of abrupt changes in the national policy toward foreign investors which in turn could result in unilateral modification of concessions or contracts increased taxation denial of permits or permit renewals or expropriation of assets as part of a review of all mining contracts by the ministry of mines the ministry in the drc in february 2008 we received notification that the ministry wished to renegotiate several material provisions of tenke fungurume mining sarls tfm mining concessions in october 2010 the drc government concluded its review of tfms existing mining contracts and confirmed that they are in good standing in connection with the review tfm made several commitments that were reflected in amendments to its mining contracts which were signed by the parties in december 2010 approved by a ministerial council in march 2011 and a presidential decree was issued in april 2011 in addition effective march 26 2012 the drc government issued a presidential decree approving 

modifications to tfms bylaws among other changes to the amended and restated mining convention armc fcxs effective ownership in tfm was reduced from 5775 percent to 56 percent 

political economic social and security risks in the drc are generally outside of our control and could adversely affect our business these risks include legal and regulatory uncertainties exposure to an environment of governmental corruption and bribery attempts to increase taxes or claims for fees and penalties by governmental officials including retroactive claims security risks resulting from political instability in the drc and risk of loss due to civil strife acts of war guerrilla activities insurrection and terrorism 

in addition to ongoing conflict in the eastern region of the drc there have been a limited number of reported acts of violence in the katanga province where the tenke fungurme minerals district is located the safety of our workforce at all of our operations is our highest priority and tfm works cooperatively with government officials to address security issues however no assurance can be given that conflict or random acts of violence will not occur near or impact tfms operations 

accordingly the tenke fungurume minerals district and its future development projects may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control any of which could adversely affect our operating results interrupt our operations or result in a loss of all or part of our investment in the drc 

terrorist attacks and violence near our operations and throughout the world and the potential for additional future terrorist acts and violence have created economic and political uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business 

refer to the international risk factor “because our grasberg minerals district is our most significant operating asset our business may continue to be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties in indonesia” for more information about a series of shooting incidents near our grasberg minerals district 

in july 2009 two suicide bombers set off explosions inside of the jw marriott and ritzcarlton hotels in jakarta indonesia that killed nine people and injured 53 others including two of our indonesiabased executives 

in october 2005 three suicide bombers killed 19 people and wounded over 100 in the indonesian province of bali which is 1500 miles west of our mining and milling operations in september 2004 11 people were killed and over 200 injured by a car bomb detonated in front of the australian embassy in jakarta in august 2003 12 people were killed and over 100 were injured by a car bomb detonated outside of the jw marriott hotel in jakarta indonesia in october 2002 a bombing killed 202 people in bali indonesian authorities arrested 35 people in connection with this bombing and 29 of those arrested have been tried and convicted the same international terrorist organizations are suspected in each of these incidents in november 2005 indonesian police raided a house in east java that resulted in the death of other accused terrorists linked to the bombings discussed above our mining and milling operations were not interrupted by these incidents but pt freeport indonesias corporate office in jakarta had to relocate for several months following the bombing in front of the australian embassy in addition to the bali jw marriott hotel and australian embassy bombings there have been antiamerican demonstrations in certain sections of indonesia reportedly led by radical islamic activists 

no assurance can be given that additional terrorist incidents and acts of violence will not occur if there were to be additional terrorist incidents or acts of violence particularly at or near our operations there could be no assurance that the occurrence of such events would not have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

operational risks 

our business is subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our business 

mines by their nature are subject to many operational risks some of which are outside of our control these operational risks which could adversely affect our business operating results and cash flows include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

managing the volume of waste rock leach material and tailings produced in our mining operations also presents significant environmental safety and engineering challenges and risks we maintain large leach pads and tailings impoundments containing viscous material which must be monitored for structural stability and leakages our tailings impoundments in arid areas must have effective programs to suppress fugitive dust emissions and we must effectively monitor and treat acid rock drainage in indonesia we use a river transport system for tailings management which presents other risks as discussed elsewhere in these risk factors the failure to adequately manage these risks could result in significant personal injury loss of life property damage and damage to the environment both in and around our areas of operations as well as damage to production facilities and delays in or curtailments of production 

our business may also be impacted by information technology disruptions cybersecurity incidents in particular are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data we have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past and may experience them in the future we believe that we have implemented appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technology disruptions however given the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of information technology disruptions we could potentially be subject to production downtimes operational delays the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information destruction or corruption of data security breaches other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations 

labor unrest and activism could disrupt our operations and may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

as further described in part i items 1 and 2 “business and properties  labor matters” we are party to labor agreements with various unions that represent employees at our operations labor agreements are negotiated on a periodic basis and the risk exists that labor agreements may not be renewed on reasonably satisfactory terms to us or at all we cannot predict what issues may be raised by the collective bargaining units representing our employees and if raised whether negotiations concerning those issues will be concluded successfully our production and sales volumes could be significantly reduced and our business financial condition and results of operations adversely affected by significant reductions in productivity or protracted work stoppages at one or more 

of our operations additionally if we enter into a new labor agreement with any union that significantly increases our labor costs relative to our competitors our ability to compete may be materially and adversely affected 

during 2011 pt freeport indonesia was adversely affected by labor disruptions including an eightday work stoppage in july 2011 and an approximate threemonth strike that concluded in december 2011 the strike involved civil unrest transportation blockades sabotage of important operating facilities and violence additionally during firstquarter 2012 pt freeport indonesia experienced work interruptions in connection with its efforts to resume normal operations and temporarily suspended operations 

in fourthquarter 2011 there was an approximate twomonth labor strike at cerro verde during the negotiation of a new labor agreement the strike did not have a significant impact on production and a new threeyear agreement with the union was reached in late december 2011 

as of december 31 2012  approximately 50 percent  of our labor force was covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 35 percent  of our labor force is covered by agreements that will expire within one year 

if we do not successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements with our union workers we may incur prolonged strikes and other work stoppages at our mining operations which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our mining production depends on the availability of sufficient water supplies 

our operations require significant quantities of water for mining ore processing and related support facilities our operations in north and south america are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant continuous production at our mines is dependent on our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies 

at our north america operations certain of our water supplies are supported by surface water rights which give us the right to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location in arizona we are a participant in two active general stream adjudications in which for over 30 years the arizona courts have been attempting to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for two of the states largest river systems which affect four of our operating mines morenci safford sierrita and miami the legal precedent set in these proceedings may also affect our bagdad mine groundwater has historically been treated differently from surface water under arizona law which has generally allowed land owners to pump at will subject to the doctrine of reasonable use however court decisions in one of the adjudications have concluded that groundwater pumping may affect surface water thereby bringing the pumping within the jurisdiction of the general stream adjudications the effort to define the boundaries between groundwater and surface water remains contested however and is currently a primary focus of one of those adjudications because groundwater accounts for approximately 40 percent of arizona’s water supplies the recharacterization of any significant portion of that water as surface water could jeopardize the ability of consumers farmers ranchers municipalities and industrial users like us to continue to access water supplies that have been relied on for decades because we are a significant user of groundwater in arizona we are an active participant in the adjudication proceedings 

in colorado our surface water and groundwater rights are subject to adjudication and we are involved in legal proceedings to resolve disputes regarding priority and administration of rights including priority of some of our rights for the climax molybdenum mine in new mexico our surface water and groundwater rights are fully licensed or have been fully adjudicated 

water for our cerro verde mining operation comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the rio chili watershed that collect water primarily from seasonal precipitation due to occasional drought conditions and the possibility that climate change will reduce precipitation levels temporary supply shortages are possible that could affect our current and planned cerro verde operations cerro verde has been conducting water studies to assess opportunities for additional supplies to support current operations and potential future expansion projects cerro verde has reached an agreement with the regional government of arequipa the national government servicio de agua potable y alcantarillado de arequipa sa sedapar and other local institutions to allow it to finance the engineering and construction of a wastewater treatment plant should cerro verde proceed with plans for a largescale concentrator expansion once cerro verde obtains a license for the treated water it would be used to supplement its existing water supplies to support the concentrator expansion 

water for our el abra mining operation comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascotán aquifer in 2010 el abra obtained regulatory approval subject to certain conditions for the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascotán aquifer for its sulfide processing plant which began operations in 2011 we believe that el abra has sufficient water rights to support current operations however a change to the sulfide ore project such as increased production or mill processing would require additional water beyond our sulfide groundwater pumping which is permitted through 2021 el abra is also conducting studies to assess the feasibility of constructing a desalination plant near the pacific ocean to treat seawater for possible increased sulfide ore production or mill processing 

water for our candelaria and ojos del salado mining operations is drawn from the copiapó river aquifer because of rapid depletion of this aquifer in recent years candelaria is expanding its sources of water supply during 2010 we completed construction of a pipeline to convey reclaimed water from a nearby water treatment facility to our candelaria mine in addition we have substantially completed the construction of a desalination plant and pipeline that will supply candelaria’s longer term water needs 

although each of our operations currently has access to sufficient water supplies to support current operational demands some supplies are subject to unresolved claims by others and additional supplies that may be needed to support expanded operations are expensive in short supply and can be difficult to access because of logistical and legal obstacles moreover we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings on our water rights claims and uses the loss of a water right loss of continued use of a currently available water supply or inability to expand our water resources could materially and adversely affect our mining operations by significantly increasing the cost of water forcing us to curtail operations preventing us from expanding operations or forcing premature closures thereby increasing andor accelerating costs or foregoing profitable operations 

increased production costs could reduce our profitability and cash flow 

our copper mining operations require significant energy principally diesel electricity coal and natural gas for the year 2012  energy represented approximately 21 percent  of our consolidated copper production costs an inability to procure sufficient energy at reasonable prices could adversely affect our profits cash flow and growth opportunities 

our consolidated copper production costs are also affected by the prices of commodities we consume or use in our operations such as sulphuric acid grinding media steel reagents liners tires explosives and diluents the prices of such commodities are influenced by supply and demand trends affecting the mining industry in general and other factors outside our control and such prices are at times subject to volatile movements increases in the cost of these commodities could make our operations less profitable increases in the costs of commodities that we consume or use may also significantly affect the capital costs of new projects 

also refer to the environmental risk factor “regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change issues may increase our costs and adversely affect our operations and markets” for discussion of the potential for increased energy costs 

in addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry our indonesia operations involve additional risks because they are located on unusually difficult terrain in a very remote area 

the grasberg minerals district is located in steep mountainous terrain in a remote area of indonesia because of these conditions we have had to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities in addition the area receives considerable rainfall which has led to periodic floods and mudslides the mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time our insurance may not sufficiently cover an unexpected natural or operating disaster 

in april 2011 two pt freeport indonesia employees died in an accident when a portion of the deep ore zone doz mine experienced an uncontrolled muck flow the area was temporarily shut down during the investigation of the accident 

in september 2008 a small scale failure encompassing approximately 75000 metric tons of material occurred at our grasberg open pit there were no injuries or property damage the event caused a delay in our access to the 

highgrade section of the open pit and as a result a portion of the metal expected to be mined in the second half of 2008 was deferred to future periods 

in march 2006 a mudtopsoil slide involving approximately 75000 metric tons of material occurred from a mountain ridge above service facilities supporting pt freeport indonesias mining facilities three contract workers were fatally injured in the event the material damaged a mess hall and an adjacent area as a result of investigations by pt freeport indonesia and the indonesian department of energy and mineral resources we conducted geotechnical studies to identify and address any potential hazards to workers and facilities from slides the existing early warning system for potential slides based upon rainfall and other factors has also been expanded 

in october 2003 a slippage of material occurred in a section of the grasberg open pit resulting in eight fatalities in december 2003 a debris flow involving a relatively small amount of loose material occurred in the same section of the open pit resulting in only minor property damage the events caused us to alter our shortterm mine sequencing plans normal production activities resumed in secondquarter 2004 

no assurance can be given that similar events will not occur in the future 

in addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry our africa mining operation involves additional risks because it is located in a remote area of the drc 

the tenke fungurume minerals district is located in a remote area of the drc and is subject to additional challenges including 

 

 

 

 

 

additionally due to limited rail access we currently truck a significant portion of the production from the tenke mines approximately 1900 miles to ports in south africa the tenke fungurume minerals district and its future development may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control which could adversely affect their contribution to our operating results and increase the cost of future development 

the volume and grade of ore reserves that we recover and our rate of production may be more or less than anticipated 

our ore reserve amounts are determined in accordance with industry guide 7 as required by the securities exchange age of 1934 and are estimates of the mineral deposits that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination the determination of reserves involves numerous uncertainties with respect to the ultimate geology of the ore bodies including quantities grades and recovery rates and estimates may change as new data becomes available estimating the quantity and grade of reserves requires us to determine the size shape and depth or our ore bodies by analyzing geological data such as samplings of drill holes tunnels and other underground workings in addition to the geology of our mines assumptions are required to determine the economic feasibility of mining these reserves including estimates of future commodity prices and demand the mining methods we use and the related costs incurred to develop and mine our reserves a sustained decrease in commodity prices may result in a reduction in economically recoverable ore reserves these factors may result in variations in the volumes of mineral reserves that we report from period to period 

there are also uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of ore reserves and copper recovered from mill and leach stockpiles the quantity of copper delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated 

copper grade contained in the material delivered to the mill and leach stockpiles processes and recovery rates are monitored regularly and recovery rate estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes accordingly the volume and grade of ore reserves recovered rates of production and copper recovered from stockpiles may be less than anticipated 

we must continually replace reserves depleted by production our exploration activities may not result in additional discoveries 

our ability to replenish our ore reserves is important to our longterm viability produced ore reserves must be replaced by further delineation of existing ore bodies or by locating new deposits in order to maintain production levels over the long term exploration is highly speculative in nature our exploration projects involve many risks require substantial expenditures and may not result in the discovery of sufficient additional mineral deposits that can be mined profitably once a site with mineralization is discovered it may take several years from the initial phases of drilling until production is possible during which time the economic feasibility of production may change substantial expenditures are required to establish recoverable proven and probable reserves and to construct mining and processing facilities as a result there is no assurance that current or future exploration programs will be successful there is a risk that depletion of reserves will not be offset by discoveries or acquisitions 

development projects are inherently risky and may require more capital than anticipated which could adversely affect our business 

there are many risks and uncertainties inherent in all development projects the economic feasibility of development projects is based on many factors including the accuracy of estimated reserves metallurgical recoveries capital and operating costs and estimated future prices of the relevant minerals the capital expenditures and time required to develop new mines or other projects are considerable and changes in costs or construction schedules can adversely affect project economics moreover underground mining is generally more expensive than surface mining as a result of higher capital costs including costs for modern mining equipment and construction of extensive ventilation systems therefore it is possible that actual costs and economic returns may differ materially from our estimates refer to item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further discussion of our current development projects 

new development projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future cash flow these development projects also require the successful completion of feasibility studies acquisition of governmental permits acquisition of land power and water and ensuring that appropriate community infrastructure is developed by third parties to support such projects it is possible that we could fail to obtain the government approvals necessary for the operation of a project in which case the project may not proceed either on its original timing or at all it is not unusual for new mining operations to experience unexpected problems during the startup phase resulting in delays in producing revenue and increases in capital expenditures 

the development of underground mines is subject to additional risks including the following 

 

 

 

 

some of these risks could result in delays to production startup and a loss or reduction in minable tons there can be no assurance that the occurrence of such events or conditions would not have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

environmental risks 

our operations are subject to complex and evolving environmental laws and regulation compliance with environmental regulatory requirements involves significant costs and may constrain our expansion opportunities 

our mining development exploration and production activities both in the us and internationally are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing occupational health mine safety generation transportation and disposal of hazardous toxic substances waste disposal air emissions and water discharges remediation of the environment protection of endangered and protected species and other related matters compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs which we expect will continue to increase over time because of increased regulatory oversight adoption of increasingly stringent environmental standards as well as other factors 

for example under the clean air act epa recently lowered the national ambient air quality standards naaqs for sulfur dioxide the area around our smelter in miami arizona has sulfur dioxide levels in excess of the new standard and the smelter is the primary contributor to those levels as a result we will be required to limit the smelter’s operations or install expensive pollution control equipment that will significantly reduce those emissions additionally any expansion of the smelter will be constrained by or be significantly more expensive because of these new standards 

in addition epa has recently proposed rules that if effective would reclassify some mineral processing materials as “hazardous waste” under the federal resource conservation and recovery act which would reverse longstanding epa regulatory determinations and subject the industry to significant new and costly waste management requirements 

we also believe there has generally been more aggressive application of the endangered species act resulting in increases in the number of protected species and expansive designations of their critical habitat which may make obtaining federal permits and securing additional water resources more timeconsuming unpredictable and expensive 

other regulation under consideration by environmental regulatory agencies include provisions that would impose additional restrictions on waterway discharges and regulate environmental impacts of radioactive materials associated with mining operations and expand regulation of solid wastes among other things 

adoption of these or similar new environmental regulations or more stringent application of existing regulations may materially increase our costs and constrain our us expansion opportunities 

in addition to compliance with environmental regulation at our operating sites we incur significant costs for remediating environmental conditions on properties that have not been operated in many years 

freeportmcmoran corporation fmc and many of its affiliates and predecessor companies have been involved in exploration mining milling smelting and manufacturing in the us for more than a century activities that occurred in the late 19th century and the 20th century prior to the advent of modern environmental laws were not subject to environmental regulation and were conducted before american industrial companies understood the longterm effects of their operations on the surrounding environment with the passage of cercla in 1980 companies like fmc became legally responsible for environmental remediation on properties previously owned or operated by them irrespective of when the damage to the environment occurred or who caused it that liability is often shared on a joint and several basis with all other owners and operators meaning that each owner or operator of the property is fully responsible for the cleanup although in many cases some or all of the other historical owners or operators no longer exist do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found as a result because of our acquisition of fmc in 2007 many of the subsidiary companies we now own are responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the us and we expect to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those remediation issues we are also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources at december 31 2012  we had more than 100  active remediation projects including damaged natural resource claims in the us in 28  states 

at december 31 2012  we had 12 billion  recorded in our consolidated balance sheet for environmental obligations attributed to cercla or analogous state programs and for estimated future costs associated with environmental matters at closed facilities or closed portions of certain operating facilities our environmental obligation estimates are primarily based upon 

 

 

 

significant adjustments to these estimates are likely to occur in the future as additional information becomes available the actual environmental costs ultimately may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs and any such changes could be material 

in addition remediation standards imposed by epa and state environmental agencies have generally become more stringent over time for example in some cases epa has applied increasingly costly requirements regarding remediation of contaminated water bottom sediments continued application of these types of standards could have an adverse impact on our ultimate cleanup costs at the newtown creek site in new york city additionally imposition of more stringent remediation standards poses a risk that additional remediation work could be required at sites that we have already remediated to the satisfaction of the responsible governmental agencies and may increase the risk of toxic tort litigation 

refer to note 13  for further discussion of our environmental obligations 

during 2012  we incurred environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs including our joint venture partners shares to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect our operations of 612 million  compared with 387 million  in 2011  and 372 million  in 2010  for 2013  we expect to incur approximately 600 million  of aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs the timing and amounts of estimated payments could change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements changes in scope and costs of reclamation activities the settlement of environmental matters and as actual spending occurs 

an adverse ruling in one or more pending legal proceedings involving environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on us 

as described in note 13 we are a defendant in numerous and in some cases significant litigation matters involving alleged environmental contamination alleged environmental toxic torts and complex interpretations of environmental regulations an adverse ruling in one or more of those matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

our indonesia mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges and future changes in environmental laws or unanticipated environmental impacts from those operations could require us to incur increased costs 

mining operations on the scale of our indonesia operations involve significant environmental risks and challenges our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of crushed and ground rock material called tailings that results from the process by which we physically separate the copper gold and silverbearing materials from the ore that we mine our tailings management plan which has been approved by the indonesian government uses the river system near our mine to transport the tailings to an engineered area in the lowlands where the tailings and natural sediments are managed in a deposition area lateral levees have been constructed to help contain the footprint of the tailings and to limit their impact in the lowlands 

another major environmental challenge is managing overburden which is the rock that must be moved aside in the mining process to reach the ore in the presence of air water and naturally occurring bacteria some overburden can generate acid rock drainage or acidic water containing dissolved metals that if not properly managed can adversely affect the environment 

from time to time certain indonesian government officials have raised questions with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans including a suggestion that we implement a pipeline system rather than our river transport system for tailings management and disposition because our indonesia mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area a pipeline system would be costly difficult to construct and maintain and more prone to catastrophic failure and could therefore involve significant potentially adverse environmental issues based on our own studies and others conducted by third parties we do not believe that a pipeline system is necessary or practical 

in connection with obtaining our environmental approvals from the indonesian government we committed to perform a onetime environmental risk assessment on the impacts of our tailings management plan we completed this extensive environmental risk assessment with more than 90 scientific studies conducted over four years and submitted it to the indonesian government in december 2002 we developed the risk assessment study using internationally recognized methods with input from an independent review panel which included representatives from the indonesian government academia and nongovernmental organizations the risks identified during this process were in line with our impact projections of the tailings management program contained in our environmental approval documents 

since 2005 pt freeport indonesia has participated in the indonesian governments proper program for pollution control evaluation and rating program the last proper audit where the indonesian ministry of environment issued pt freeport indonesia a rating was in 2010 for which a blue rating was issued acknowledging pt freeport indonesias environmental management practices as being in compliance with the laws and regulations in indonesia in 2011 a proper audit of pt freeport indonesia was performed however the indonesian ministry of environment did not issue a rating for pt freeport indonesia a proper audit of pt freeport indonesia was not performed in 2012 because of security conditions that existed 

mine closure regulations impose substantial costs on our operations   

our us operations are subject to various federal and state permitting requirements that include mine closure and minedland reclamation obligations these requirements are complex and vary depending upon the jurisdiction the laws govern the determination of the scope and cost of the closure and reclamation obligations and the amount and forms of financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to meet the obligations of those plans if we are unable to do so in general our us mines are required to review estimated closure and reclamation costs on either a periodic basis or at the time of significant permit modifications and post increasing amounts of financial assurance as required it is uncertain how potential epa requirements for financial assurance will affect the timing of periodic closure cost reviews or the scope of closure activities 

in july 2011 the chilean senate passed legislation regulating mine closure which became effective november 2012 and established new requirements for closure plans our chilean operations will be required to update closure plans and provide financial assurance for these obligations revised closure plans for our chilean mine sites are due in november 2014 

cerro verde is subject to regulation under the mine closure law administered by the peruvian ministry of energy and mines under the closure regulations mines must submit a closure plan that includes the reclamation methods closure cost estimates methods of control and verification closure and postclosure plans and financial assurance the updated closure plan for the cerro verde mine expansion must be submitted to the peruvian regulatory authorities in december 2013 

in december 2009 pt freeport indonesia submitted its revised mine closure plan to the department of energy and minerals resources for review and has addressed comments received during the course of this review process in december 2010 the president of indonesia issued a regulation regarding mine reclamation and closure which requires a company to provide a mine closure guarantee in the form of a time deposit placed in a stateowned bank in indonesia in accordance with its cow pt freeport indonesia is working with the department of energy and 

mineral resources to review these requirements including discussions of other options for the mine closure guarantee 

we cannot predict at this time the cost of these closure plans or the levels or forms of financial assurance that may be required which amounts could be substantial 

at december 31 2012  we had asset retirement obligations aros of 11 billion  recorded in our consolidated balance sheet aro cost estimates may increase or decrease significantly in the future as a result of changes in closure regulations changes in engineering designs and technology permit modifications or updates changes in mine plans inflation or other factors and as actual reclamation spending occurs refer to note 13 for further discussion 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change issues may increase our costs and adversely affect our operations and markets 

many scientists believe that emissions from the combustion of carbonbased fuels contribute to greenhouse effects and therefore contribute to climate change in 2012 our worldwide total greenhouse gas emissions measured as carbon dioxide equivalent emissions were approximately 10 million metric tons divided between direct 59 percent and indirect 41 percent emissions most of our direct emissions are from fuel combustion in haul trucks followed by the combustion of fuels to provide energy for roasting smelting and other processes indirect emissions are generally the emissions of outside providers from whom we purchase electricity for use in our operations our direct emissions are in indonesia 54 percent north america 28 percent south america 11 percent and europe and africa 7 percent our indirect emissions are in north america 73 percent south america 24 percent and europe 3 percent 

a number of governments have introduced or are contemplating regulatory initiatives designed to control and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in june 2010 the epa issued final regulations under the clean air act for the control of greenhouse gases from new large stationary sources and major modifications to existing large stationary sources this and other federal greenhouse gas regulations have been challenged in judicial proceedings certain of our operations including the miami smelter could be materially affected by these regulations if plant expansions exceed applicable thresholds in addition anticipated future epa regulations covering large fossil fuel fired power plants may materially increase energy costs at our operations the us may also become a party to international agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions which could lead to new regulations affecting our us operations the december 1997 kyoto protocol established greenhouse gas emission targets for developed countries that ratified the protocol in 2012 parties to the kyoto protocol agreed to a second commitment period beyond the original december 2012 expiration date although the us has not ratified the kyoto protocol the us continues to participate in global climate summits that may lead to an agreement in the future 

since 2006 we have participated in the carbon disclosure project which is a voluntary initiative that promotes standardized reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and reduction efforts in 2009 we formed a multidepartmental greenhouse gas task force to pursue ways to improve the energy efficiency of our operations and reduce greenhouse gas emissions including evaluating potential reductions in emissions from our haul trucks however because of longer and steeper mining hauls as our open pits expand and deepen and increases in use of electricity as we increase production capacity we expect increases in our total greenhouse gas emissions 

from a medium and longterm perspective we are likely to experience increased costs relating to our greenhouse gas emissions as a result of regulatory initiatives in the us and other countries in which we operate in addition the cost of electricity that we purchase from others may increase if our suppliers incur increased costs from the regulation of their greenhouse gas emissions we cannot predict the magnitude of any increased costs at this time given the wide scope of potential regulatory changes in the many countries in which we operate 

the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would vary by operation based on particular geographic circumstances these may include changes in rainfall patterns water shortages changing sea levels changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperatures these effects may adversely impact the cost production and financial performance of our operations 

other risks 

if market prices for our commodities decline the carrying values of inventories and longlived assets may be impaired which could require charges to operating income that could be material 

declines in the market price of copper among other factors could cause us to record lower of cost or market lcm inventory adjustments and could also result in a writedown of the carrying value of longlived assets which would potentially have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and stockholders equity but would have no effect on cash flows 

during fourthquarter 2008 we concluded that the thencurrent economic environment and significant declines in copper and molybdenum prices represented significant adverse changes in our business requiring us to evaluate our longlived assets and goodwill for impairment as a result we recorded significant impairment and lcm inventory charges refer to item 6 selected financial data for a summary of these charges 

unanticipated litigation or negative developments in pending litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are a party to the litigation described in note 13 and in item 3 “legal proceedings” and a number of other litigation matters including asbestos exposure cases disputes over the allocation of environmental remediation obligations at superfund and other sites disputes over water rights and disputes with regulatory authorities the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant monetary damages penalties or injunctive relief against us limitations on our property rights or regulatory interpretations that increase our operating costs if any of these disputes results in a substantial monetary judgment against us or an adverse legal interpretation is settled on unfavorable terms or otherwise affects our operations it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we depend on our senior management team and other key employees and the loss of any of these employees could adversely affect our business 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract retain and motivate senior management and other key employees achieving this objective may be difficult because of many factors including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions competitors hiring practices cost reduction activities and the effectiveness of our compensation programs competition for qualified personnel can be very intense we must continue to recruit retain and motivate senior management and other key employees to maintain our current business and support our future projects a loss of such personnel could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and our operating results could be adversely affected 

our holding company structure may impact your ability to receive dividends  

we are a holding company with no material assets other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries as a result our ability to repay our indebtedness and pay dividends is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend loan debt repayment or otherwise our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to make funds available to us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends dividends from subsidiaries that are not wholly owned are shared with other equity owners cash at our international operations is also subject to foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation into the us 

in addition our subsidiaries may not be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries assets upon their liquidation reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries creditors including any trade creditors 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult these provisions 

 

 

 

 

 

these provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by the board 

in addition because we are incorporated in delaware we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with or acquisition of us 

these provisions may deter an acquisition of us that might otherwise be attractive to stockholders 

risks associated with the proposed acquisitions of plains exploration  production company pxp and mcmoran exploration co mmr 

our proposed acquisitions of pxp and mmr may present certain risks to our business and operations 

on december 5 2012 we announced definitive merger agreements to acquire pxp and mmr the proposed acquisitions present numerous risks including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition we have incurred substantial costs in connection with the proposed acquisitions a significant amount of which are required to be paid whether or not the transactions are completed one or more of these factors could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

refer to note 1  for further discussion of the proposed acquisitions of pxp and mmr 

pending litigation against us pxp and mmr could result in injunctions preventing completion of either or both of the proposed acquisitions and the payment of damages in the event one or both of the transactions is completed 

in connection with the proposed acquisitions stockholders of each of fcx pxp and mmr have filed numerous derivative lawsuits against us and class action lawsuits against us pxp and mmr among others among other remedies the plaintiffs in these lawsuits seek to enjoin the proposed acquisitions we may be subject to additional stockholder lawsuits during the pendency of the proposed acquisitions these lawsuits could prevent or delay completion of one or both of the proposed acquisitions and result in substantial costs to us including any costs associated with the indemnification of directors the defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved may adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

refer to note 13  for further discussion of shareholder litigation that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

consummating the pxp merger but failing to complete the mmr merger could have consequences under the clayton antitrust act the clayton act and negatively affect the combined companys future business and financial results 

if the pxp merger is completed but the mmr merger is not completed then the boards of directors and executive management of fcx and mmr may need to be reconstituted in order to comply with the clayton act subject to certain de minimis exceptions section 8 of the clayton act prohibits individuals from serving as directors or officers of two competing corporations when each corporation has capital surplus and undivided profits in excess of 278 million currently fcx and mmr share overlapping board and management members an overlap that is expected to continue even after the pxp merger is consummated unless the mmr merger is also consummated in the event that the pxp merger closes without the mmr merger also closing the us department of justice or federal trade commission could investigate whether the combined company and mmr are competitors for purposes of the clayton act and could seek to eliminate the interlock by securing resignation of the interlocked individuals or by pursuing injunctive relief private plaintiffs could also bring suits against the combined company seeking an injunction against the interlock the potential distraction from operations loss of key executive talent and cost of litigation could adversely affect the combined companys business financial condition or result of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in numerous legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business or are associated with environmental issues arising from legacy operations conducted over the years by freeportmcmoran corporation fmc and its affiliates we are also involved periodically in inquiries investigations and other proceedings initiated by or involving government agencies some of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief management does not believe based on currently available information that the outcome of any legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition although individual outcomes could be material to our operating results for a particular period depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period below is a discussion of our material water rights legal proceedings refer to note 13 for discussion of our other material legal proceedings 

water rights 

our operations in the western united states us require significant quantities of water for mining ore processing and related support facilities continuous operation of our mines is dependent on our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies in the arid western us water rights are often contested and disputes over water rights are generally timeconsuming expensive and not necessarily dispositive unless they resolve both actual and potential claims the loss of a water right loss of continued use of a currently available water supply or inability to expand our water resources could materially and adversely affect our mining operations by significantly increasing the cost of water forcing us to curtail operations preventing us from expanding operations or forcing premature closures thereby increasing andor accelerating costs and foregoing profitable operations 

at our north america operations certain of our water supplies are supported by surface water rights which give us the right to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location in arizona we are a participant in two active general stream adjudications in which for over 30 years the arizona courts have been attempting to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for two of the states largest river systems which affect four of our operating mines morenci safford sierrita and miami the legal precedent set in these proceedings may also affect our bagdad mine groundwater has historically been treated differently from surface water under arizona law which has generally allowed land owners to pump at will subject to the doctrine of reasonable use however court decisions in one of the adjudications have concluded that groundwater pumping may affect surface water thereby bringing the pumping within the jurisdiction of the general stream adjudications the effort to define the boundaries between groundwater and surface water remains contested however and is currently the principal focus of one of those adjudications because groundwater accounts for approximately 40 percent of arizonas water supplies the recharacterization of any significant portion of that water as surface water could jeopardize the ability of consumers farmers ranchers municipalities and industrial users like us to continue to access water supplies that have been relied on for decades because we are a significant user of groundwater in arizona we are an active participant in the adjudication proceedings 

in re the general adjudication of all rights to use water in the little colorado water system and sources  apache county superior court no 6417 filed on or about february 17 1978 the principal parties in addition to us include the state of arizona the salt river project the arizona public service company the navajo nation the hopi indian tribe the san juan southern paiute tribe and the us on behalf of those tribes on its own behalf and on behalf of the white mountain apache tribe 

in re the general adjudication of all rights to use water in the gila river system and sources  

maricopa county superior court cause nos w1 salt w2 verde w3 upper gila and w4 san pedro this case was originally initiated in 1974 with the filing of a petition with the arizona state land department and was consolidated and transferred to the maricopa county superior court in 1981 the principal parties in addition to us include the state of arizona the gila valley irrigation district the franklin irrigation district the san carlos irrigation and drainage district the salt river project the san carlos apache tribe the gila river indian community gric and the us on behalf of those tribes on its own behalf and on behalf of the white mountain apache tribe the fort mcdowell mohaveapache indian community the salt river pimamaricopa indian community and the payson community of yavapai apache indians 

the maricopa county superior court issued a decision in 2005 in the gila river adjudication that directed the arizona department of water resources adwr to prepare detailed recommendations regarding the delineation of the “subflow” zone of the san pedro river basin a tributary of the gila river according to the court the subflow zone is the subsurface area adjacent to the river where the court may find that groundwater is connected to the surface water such that groundwater pumping may reduce surface flows although we have minimal interests in the san pedro river basin a decision that recharacterizes groundwater in that basin as surface water may set a precedent for other river systems in arizona that could have material implications for many commercial industrial municipal and agricultural users of groundwater including our arizona operations 

adwr produced its recommendations in june 2009 and those recommendations were objected to by numerous parties on both sides of the issue adwr responded to those objections in january 2011 following a threeday hearing held in late january 2012 at which various parties provided testimony and oral argument regarding the strengths and weaknesses of adwrs technical approach to characterizing underground flows as groundwater or surface water the court directed adwr to submit a further report detailing the additional work it deemed necessary to properly delineate the san pedro river basin subflow zone on october 12 2012 the court issued an order instructing adwr to conduct additional technical work and issue revised subflow zone maps for the san pedro river basin on october 17 2012 the arizona supreme court announced the appointment of a replacement for the judge who had presided over the case for more than 10 years as a result of his appointment to the federal bankruptcy court the new presiding judge is the fourth judge to preside over the case since its inception almost 40 years ago on january 10 2013 the new presiding judge heard oral arguments regarding the additional work to be performed by adwr in order to develop revised subflow zone maps for the san pedro river basin and issued an order instructing adwr to complete additional technical work and submit a new report by april 1 2014 given the legal and technical complexity of this adjudication its long history and its longterm legal economic and political implications it is difficult to predict the timing or the outcome of this issue or of the overall adjudication if we are unable to satisfactorily resolve the issues being addressed in this adjudication our ability to pump groundwater could be diminished or curtailed and our operations at morenci safford sierrita miami and bagdad could be adversely affected 

prior to january 1 1983 various indian tribes filed suits in the us district court in arizona claiming superior rights to water being used by many other water users including us and claiming damages for prior use in derogation of their allegedly superior rights these federal proceedings have been stayed pending the arizona superior court adjudications 

in 1998 we and several other parties entered into a water rights settlement agreement with gric one of the largest claimants in the gila river adjudication that was later included in a comprehensive water rights settlement under the arizona water settlements act of 2004 finalization of the gric settlement is subject to contingencies and the comprehensive settlement has been challenged by other parties if we are unable to resolve the contingencies in the gric settlement and defeat the thirdparty challenges our water rights in the gila river watershed could be diminished and our operations at morenci safford sierrita and miami could be adversely affected 

united states v gila valley irrigation district  united states district court district of arizona was initiated in 1925 by the us to settle conflicting claims to water rights in portions of the gila river watershed a decree settling the claims of various parties was entered in 1935 after we were dismissed from the case without prejudice in 1988 gric intervened challenging uses of water in the gila river watershed which may affect our ability to divert water from eagle creek chase creek or the san francisco river for operation of our morenci mine pursuant to decreed rights and an agreement between us and the gila valley irrigation district our morenci operations also purchased farm lands with water rights in 1997 1998 and 2008 that could be affected by the outcome of this proceeding impairment of our water claims in the gila river watershed could adversely affect the operations of our morenci and safford mines 




 item 4 mine safety disclosures 

the safety and health of all employees is our highest priority management believes that safety and health considerations are integral to and compatible with all other functions in the organization and that proper safety and health management will enhance production and reduce costs our approach towards the health and safety of our workforce is to continuously improve performance through implementing robust management systems and providing adequate training safety incentive and occupational health programs

general 

we are a leading international mining company with headquarters in phoenix arizona and we were incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware on november 10 1987 we are one of the world’s largest copper gold and molybdenum mining companies in terms of reserves and production our portfolio of assets includes the grasberg minerals district in indonesia significant mining operations in north and south america and the tenke fungurume minerals district in the democratic republic of congo drc the grasberg minerals district contains the largest single recoverable copper reserve and the largest single gold reserve of any mine in the world based on the latest available reserve data provided by thirdparty industry consultants 

we have significant reserves resources and future development opportunities within our portfolio of assets at december 31 2011  consolidated recoverable proven and probable reserves totaled 1197 billion  pounds of copper 339 million  ounces of gold 342 billion  pounds of molybdenum 3303 million  ounces of silver and 086 billion  pounds of cobalt approximately 34 percent  of our copper reserves are in north america 33 percent  are in south america 26 percent  are in indonesia and 7 percent  are in africa approximately 95 percent  of our gold reserves are in indonesia with our remaining gold reserves primarily in south america approximately 79 percent  of our molybdenum reserves are in north america with our remaining molybdenum reserves in south america refer to “ore reserves” for further discussion 

we currently operate seven copper mines in north america – morenci bagdad safford sierrita and miami in arizona and tyrone and chino in new mexico certain of our north america copper mines primarily sierrita bagdad and morenci also produce molybdenum concentrates 

we operate four copper mines in south america – cerro verde in peru and el abra candelaria and ojos del salado in chile in addition to copper the cerro verde mine also produces molybdenum concentrates and the candelaria and ojos del salado mines produce gold and silver 

in indonesia pt freeport indonesia operates the mines in the grasberg minerals district in addition to copper the grasberg minerals district also produces significant quantities of gold and silver 

in africa tenke fungurume mining sarl tfm operates the mine in the tenke fungurume minerals district the tenke mine in addition to copper tenke produces cobalt hydroxide 

during 2011  34 percent  of our consolidated copper production was from north america 35 percent  from south america 23 percent  from grasberg and 8 percent  from tenke the grasberg minerals district also accounted for 92 percent  of our consolidated gold production for 2011  refer to production data for further information 

we produce molybdenum at our henderson molybdenum mine in colorado during 2011  46 percent  of our consolidated molybdenum production was from the henderson molybdenum mine 42 percent  was produced at certain of our north america copper mines and 12 percent  was produced at our cerro verde copper mine refer to production data for further information

copper gold and molybdenum 

a brief discussion of our primary metals appears below for further discussion of the markets and prices of these metals refer to mda 

copper 

copper is an internationally traded commodity and its prices are determined by the major metals exchanges – the london metal exchange lme new york mercantile exchange comex and shanghai futures exchange shfe prices on these exchanges generally reflect the worldwide balance of copper supply and demand and can be volatile and cyclical during 2011  lme spot copper prices ranged from 308  per pound to a record high of 460  per pound averaged 400  per pound and closed at 343  per pound on december 30 2011 

in general demand for copper reflects the rate of underlying world economic growth particularly in industrial production and construction according to brook hunt a widely followed independent metals market consultant copper’s enduse markets and their estimated shares of total consumption are 



gold

copper products 

we are one of the world’s leading producers of copper concentrate cathode and continuous cast copper rod during 2011  51 percent  of our mined copper was sold in concentrate 26 percent  as cathodes and 23 percent  as rod principally from our north america operations 

our copper ores are generally processed either by smelting and refining or by solution extraction and electrowinning sxew before being subject to the smelting and refining process ore is crushed and treated to produce a copper concentrate with copper content of approximately 20 to 30 percent copper concentrate is then smelted  ie  subjected to extreme heat to produce copper anodes which weigh between 800 and 900 pounds each and have an average copper content of 995 percent the anodes are further treated by electrolytic refining to produce copper cathodes which weigh between 100 and 350 pounds each and have an average copper content of 9999 percent our copper cathodes are used as the raw material input for copper rod brass mill products and for other uses for ore subject to the sxew process copper is extracted from the ore by dissolving it with a weak sulphuric acid solution the copper content of the solution is increased in two additional solutionextraction stages and then the copperbearing solution undergoes an electrowinning process to produce cathode that is 9999 percent copper 

copper concentrate  we produce copper concentrate at eight of our mines of which pt freeport indonesia is our largest producer in north america copper concentrate is produced at our morenci bagdad sierrita and chino mines and is generally shipped to our miami smelter in arizona in south america we produce copper concentrate at our cerro verde candelaria and ojos del salado mines 

copper cathode  we produce copper cathode at two electrolytic refineries located in el paso texas and huelva spain and at 10 of our mines in north america sxew cathode is produced from our morenci bagdad safford sierrita miami tyrone and chino mines in south america from our cerro verde and el abra mines and from our tenke mine in africa   pt smelting also produces copper cathode

north america  the majority of the copper produced at our north america copper mines and refined in our el paso texas refinery is consumed at our rod plants the remainder of our north america copper production is sold in the form of copper cathode or copper concentrate to third parties generally copper rod and cathode are sold to wire and cable fabricators and brass mills under united states us dollardenominated annual contracts cathode and rod contract prices are generally based on the prevailing comex monthly average spot price for the month of shipment and include a premium 

south america    production from our south america mines is sold as copper concentrate or copper cathode to third parties under us dollardenominated annual and multiyear contracts our south america mines generally sell approximately 60 to 70 percent of their copper production in concentrate and the rest as cathode during 2011  16 percent of our south america mines copper concentrate was shipped to atlantic copper sl atlantic copper  our wholly owned copper smelting and refining unit in spain 

substantially all of south america’s copper concentrate and cathode sales contracts provide final copper pricing in a specified future month generally one to four months from the shipment date based primarily on quoted lme monthly average spot copper prices revenues from south america’s concentrate sales are recorded net of treatment and refining charges  ie  fees paid to smelters and refiners that are generally negotiated annually including any applicable price participation charges that are based on the market price of copper in addition because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrates is unrecoverable from the smelting process revenues from south america’s concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances for unrecoverable metals these allowances are a negotiated term of our contracts and vary by customer 

indonesia    pt freeport indonesia sells its production in the form of copper concentrate which contains significant quantities of gold and silver under us dollardenominated longterm contracts pt freeport indonesia also sells a small amount of copper concentrates in the spot market 

during 2011  54 percent of pt freeport indonesia’s concentrate was sold to affiliated smelters atlantic copper and pt smelting a summary of pt freeport indonesia’s aggregate percentage concentrate sales to pt smelting atlantic copper and to third parties for the last three years follows 



substantially all of pt freeport indonesias concentrate sales contracts provide final copper pricing in a specified future month generally one to four months from the shipment date based primarily on quoted lme monthly average spot copper prices revenues from pt freeport indonesias concentrate sales are recorded net of royalties and treatment and refining charges pt freeport indonesias concentrate sales are also net of allowances for unrecoverable metals 

africa  tfm sells its production in the form of copper cathode under us dollardenominated contracts substantially all of tfms cathode sales provide final copper pricing in the month after the shipment date based on quoted lme monthly average spot prices revenues from tfms cathode sales are recorded net of royalties and also include adjustments for pointofsale transportation costs that are negotiated in customer contracts 

europe    atlantic copper sells copper cathode directly to rod and brass mills primarily located in europe atlantic copper has occasionally sold copper cathode to merchants copper cathode is generally sold under annual contracts and priced based on the lme monthly average spot price for the month of arrival at the buyer’s facilities 

our copper mining operations provide atlantic copper with approximately 50 to 60 percent of its concentrate requirements at market prices following is a summary of atlantic coppers concentrate purchases from our copper mining operations and third parties for the last three years

indonesia 

ownership  pt freeport indonesia is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the republic of indonesia and incorporated in delaware we directly own 8128 percent of pt freeport indonesia and 936 percent indirectly through our wholly owned subsidiary pt indocopper investama the government of indonesia owns the remaining 936 percent 

we have established certain unincorporated joint ventures with rio tinto plc rio tinto under the joint venture arrangements rio tinto has a 40 percent interest in pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work cow and the option to participate in 40 percent of any other future exploration projects in papua indonesia refer to note 2 for further discussion 

contract of work  pt freeport indonesia conducts its current exploration and mining operations in indonesia through a cow with the government of indonesia the cow governs our rights and obligations relating to taxes exchange controls royalties repatriation and other matters and was concluded pursuant to the 1967 foreign capital investment law which expresses indonesia’s foreign investment policy and provides basic guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization a framework for economic incentives and basic rules regarding other rights and obligations of foreign investors specifically the cow provides that the government of indonesia will not nationalize or expropriate pt freeport indonesia’s mining operations any disputes regarding the provisions of the cow are subject to international arbitration we have experienced no disputes requiring arbitration during the more than 40 years we have operated in indonesia 

pt freeport indonesia’s original cow was entered into in 1967 and was replaced by a new cow in 1991 the initial term of the current cow expires in 2021 but can be extended for two 10year periods subject to indonesian government approval which pursuant to the cow cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably the cow allows us to conduct exploration mining and production activities in the 24700acre block a area which is where all of pt freeport indonesia’s proven and probable mineral reserves and current mining operations are located under the cow pt freeport indonesia also conducts exploration activities in the block b area we expect the block b area to be reduced to approximately 413000 acres once the department of energy and mineral resources demr formally accepts pt freeport indonesias relinquishment of approximately 89000 acres as further discussed in note 14  pt freeport indonesia pays copper royalties under its cow and has agreed to pay additional royalties to the government of indonesia that are not required under its cow the additional royalties provide further support to the local governments and to the people of the indonesian province of papua pt freeport indonesia’s share of the combined royalties totaled 137 million  in 2011  156 million  in 2010  and 147 million  in 2009  

pt irja eastern minerals eastern minerals of which we own 100 percent conducts exploration in papua through a joint venture agreement under a separate cow we expect eastern minerals exploration area to be reduced to approximately 283000 acres once the demr formally accepts eastern minerals relinquishment of approximately 

164000 acres 

under a joint venture agreement through pt nabire bakti mining ptnbm we conduct exploration activities under a separate cow in an area in three parcels contiguous to pt freeport indonesia’s block b and one of eastern minerals’ blocks we expect ptnbms exploration area to be reduced to approximately 301000 acres once the demr formally accepts ptnbms relinquishment of approximately 192000 acres 

in 2009 indonesia enacted a new mining law which will operate under a licensing system as opposed to the contract of work system that applies to pt freeport indonesia eastern minerals and ptnbm in 2011 and 2010 the government of indonesia promulgated regulations under the 2009 mining law and certain provisions that address existing contracts of work the laws and regulations provide that contracts of work will continue to be honored until their expiration however the regulations attempt to apply certain provisions of the new law to existing contracts of work and may seek to apply the licensing system to any extension periods of contracts of work even though our cow provides for two 10year extension periods subject to indonesian government approval which pursuant to the cow cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably in february 2012 a new regulation was adopted that would require mining companies in indonesia to process all minerals domestically and possibly ban export of concentrates and other unrefined minerals pt freeport indonesias existing cow includes specific provisions that define pt freeport indonesias rights to export product and obligate it to develop domestic smelting facilities if commercially feasible or to contract with other domestic smelters on a market basis in connection with the obligations under its cow in 1995 pt freeport indonesia constructed the only copper smelter and refinery in indonesia which is owned and operated by pt smelting 

in january 2012 the president of indonesia issued a decree calling for the creation of a team to evaluate contracts of work for adjustment to the 2009 mining law and accordingly to take steps to assess and negotiate size of work areas government revenues and domestic processing of minerals refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion we intend to continue to work cooperatively with the government of indonesia to complete this review and to seek extension of the cow beyond 2021 as provided under the terms of the cow the cow can only be modified by mutual agreement between pt freeport indonesia and the government of indonesia 

grasberg minerals district  pt freeport indonesia operates in the remote highlands of the sudirman mountain range in the province of papua indonesia which is on the western half of the island of new guinea we and our predecessors have been the only operator of exploration and mining activities in block a since 1967 the grasberg minerals district currently has three mines in operation the grasberg open pit the deep ore zone doz mine and the big gossan mine we also have significant development projects in the grasberg minerals district which are discussed in more detail in “development projects and exploration” and in mda 

pt freeport indonesia’s production including our joint venture partner’s share totaled 882 million  pounds of copper and 14 million  ounces of gold in 2011  13 billion  pounds of copper and 20 million  ounces of gold in 2010  and 16 billion  pounds of copper and 30 million  ounces of gold in 2009  

our principal source of power for all our indonesian operations is a coalfired power plant that we built in 1998 diesel generators supply peaking and backup electrical power generating capacity a combination of naturally occurring mountain streams and water derived from our underground operations provides water for our operations our indonesian operations are in an active seismic zone and experience average annual rainfall of approximately 200 inches 

grasberg open pit 

we began openpit mining of the grasberg ore body in 1990 openpit operations are expected to continue through mid2016 at which time underground mining operations are scheduled to begin at our grasberg block cave mine which is currently in development   production in the openpit is currently at the 3220 to 3940 meter elevation level and totaled 42 million metric tons of ore in 2011  which provided approximately 70 percent of pt freeport indonesias 2011  mill feed 

the current equipment fleet consists of over 500 units the larger mining equipment directly associated with production includes an available fleet of 163 haul trucks with payloads ranging from approximately 215 metric tons to 330 metric tons and 18 shovels with bucket sizes ranging from 30 cubic meters to 42 cubic meters which moved an average of 486000 metric tons of material per day during 2011 and 701000 metric tons per day in 2010 the decrease in 2011 primarily reflects the impact of labor disruptions and the temporary suspension of milling operations in fourthquarter 2011 because of damage to the concentrate and fuel pipelines refer to mda for 

further discussion 

grasberg crushing and conveying systems are integral to the mine and provide the capacity to transport up to 225000 metric tons per day of grasberg ore to the mill and 135000 metric tons per day of overburden to the overburden stockpiles the remaining overburden is moved by haul trucks 

doz mine 

the doz ore body lies vertically below the now depleted intermediate ore zone we began production from the doz ore body in 1989 using open stope mining methods but suspended production in 1991 in favor of production from the grasberg deposit production resumed in september 2000 using the blockcave method production is at the 3110meter elevation level and totaled 19 million metric tons of ore in 2011  production at the doz mine is expected to continue through 2019 beginning in 2015 we plan to ramp up production at our deep mill level zone dmlz block cave mine which lies below the doz mine and is currently under development 

the doz mine fleet consists of over 195 pieces of mobile heavy equipment which is capable of moving an average of 80000 metric tons of material per day the primary mining equipment directly associated with production and development includes an available fleet of 52 lhd units and 25 haul trucks our production lhd units typically carry approximately 11 metric tons of ore using ore passes and chutes the lhd units transfer ore into 55metric ton capacity haul trucks the trucks dump into two gyratory crushers and the ore is then conveyed to the surface stockpiles 

during 2011  we completed over 5000 meters of development drifting in support of the blockcave mining method for the doz mine the success of the development of the doz mine one of the world’s largest underground mines provides confidence in the future development of pt freeport indonesia’s largescale undeveloped underground ore bodies 

big gossan mine 

the big gossan mine lies underground and adjacent to the current mill site it is a tabular near vertical ore body with approximate dimensions of 1200 meters along strike and 800 meters down dip with varying thicknesses from 20 meters to 120 meters the mine utilizes a blasthole stoping method with delayed paste backfill stopes of varying sizes are mined and the ore dropped down passes to a truck haulage level trucks are chute loaded and transport the ore to a jaw crusher the crushed ore is then hoisted vertically via a two skip production shaft to a level where it is loaded onto a conveyor belt the belt carries the ore to one of the main underground conveyors where the ore is transferred and carried to the surface mill stockpile for processing 

production from the big gossan mine began in fourthquarter 2010 and is designed to ramp up to 7000 metric tons of ore per day by mid2013 which will result in average annual aggregate incremental production of 125 million pounds of copper and 65000 ounces of gold with pt freeport indonesia receiving 60 percent of these amounts 

description of ore bodies   our indonesia ore bodies are located within and around two main igneous intrusions the grasberg monzodiorite and the ertsberg diorite the host rocks of these ore bodies include both carbonate and clastic rocks that form the ridge crests and upper flanks of the sudirman range and the igneous rocks of monzonitic to dioritic composition that intrude them the igneoushosted ore bodies the grasberg open pit and block cave and portions of the doz block cave occur as vein stockworks and disseminations of copper sulfides dominated by chalcopyrite and to a much lesser extent bornite the sedimentaryrock hosted ore bodies portions of the doz and all of the big gossan occur as “magnetiterich calciummagnesian skarn” replacements whose location and orientation are strongly influenced by major faults and by the chemistry of the carbonate rocks along the margins of the intrusions 

the copper mineralization in these skarn deposits is dominated by chalcopyrite but higher bornite concentrations are common moreover gold occurs in significant concentrations in all of the district’s ore bodies though rarely visible to the naked eye these gold concentrations usually occur as inclusions within the copper sulfide minerals though in some deposits these concentrations can also be strongly associated with pyrite 

the following diagram indicates the relative elevations in meters of our reported ore bodies 

the following map which encompasses an area of approximately 42 square kilometers approximately 16 square miles indicates the relative positions and sizes of our reported ore bodies and their locations

tfm is organized under the laws of the drc and we currently own an effective 5775 percent interest the remaining ownership interests are held by lundin mining corporation lundin currently an effective 2475 percent interest and la générale des carrières et des mines gécamines which is wholly owned by the government of the drc currently a 175 percent nondilutable interest 

tfm is entitled to mine in the drc under an amended and restated mining convention armc with the government of the drc the original mining convention was entered into in 1996 and was replaced with the armc in 2005 as further discussed in note 14  in october 2010 the government of the drc concluded its review of tfm’s existing mining contracts and confirmed that they are in good standing in connection with the review tfm made several commitments that have been reflected in amendments to its mining contracts which were signed by the parties in december 2010 in march 2011 the amendments were approved by a ministerial council and a presidential decree signed by the president and prime minister of the drc was issued in april 2011 after receiving the required government approval of the modifications to tfms bylaws that reflect agreement with the government of the drc our effective ownership interest in the project will be reduced to 560 percent lundin’s effective ownership interest will be reduced to 240 percent  and gécamines ownership interest will increase to 200 percent  nondilutable prospectively 

tfm pays a royalty of 2 percent of net revenues under the armc which totaled 24 million  in 2011  20 million  in 2010  and 7 million  in 2009  

the tenke fungurume deposits are located in the katanga province of the drc approximately 110 miles northwest of lubumbashi and are accessible by unpaved roads and by rail the deposits are sedimenthosted copper and cobalt deposits with oxide mixed oxidesulfide and sulfide mineralization the dominant oxide minerals are malachite pseudomalachite and heterogenite important sulfide minerals consist of bornite carrollite chalcocite and chalcopyrite 

initial copper production commenced at the tenke mine in late march 2009 targeted copper production rates were achieved in september 2009 and the cobalt and sulphuric acid plants were commissioned in thirdquarter 2009 copper and cobalt are recovered through an agitationleach plant the milling facilities at the tenke mine which were designed to process ore at a rate of 8000 metric tons of ore per day have been performing above capacity with mill throughput averaging 11100  metric tons of ore per day in 2011  mining rates have been increased to enable additional copper production from the initial project capacity of 250 million pounds of copper per year to ramp up to approximately 290 million pounds of copper per year the current equipment fleet includes one 10cubic meter mass excavator two 12cubic meter frontend loaders eleven 7cubic meter frontend loaders six 91metric ton haul trucks 28 45metric ton haul trucks surface miners production drills sampling machines and crawler dozers 

production from the tenke mine totaled 281 million  pounds of copper and 25 million  pounds of cobalt in 2011  265 million pounds of copper and 20 million pounds of cobalt in 2010  and 154 million pounds of copper in 2009  

we are undertaking a second phase of the project which would include optimizing the current plant and increasing capacity refer to “development projects and exploration” for further discussion of the tenke mill expansion project we continue to engage in drilling activities exploration analyses and metallurgical testing to evaluate the potential of the highly prospective tenke fungurume minerals district these analyses are being incorporated into future 

plans to evaluate opportunities for expansion future expansions are subject to a number of factors including economic and market conditions and the business and investment climate in the drc 

the tenke fungurume minerals district is located in a tropical region however temperatures are moderated by its higher altitudes weather in this region is characterized by a dry season and a wet season each lasting about six months with average rainfall of 47 inches per year the highest bench elevation is expected to be 1518 meters above sea level and the ultimate pit bottom is expected to be 1110 meters above sea level the tenke fungurume deposits are covered by six exploitation permits totaling 394455 acres 

tfm has entered into longterm power supply and infrastructure funding agreements with la société nationale d’electricité the stateowned electric utility company serving the region the results of a recent water exploration program as well as the regional geological and hydrogeological conditions indicate that adequate water is available for the project and for hydroelectric generation during the expected life of the operation 

for comparative purposes production and sales data shown below for the year ended december 31 2007 combines our historical data with fmcs preacquisition data as the preacquisition operating data represents the results of operations under fmc management such combined data is not necessarily indicative of what past results would have been under fcx management or of future operating results

development projects and exploration 

  

we have increased production at several of our copper mines and have several projects and potential opportunities to expand production volumes extend mine lives and develop largescale underground ore bodies our nearterm major development projects which will require substantial additional capital investment are presented below refer to mda for further discussion of these projects our other development projects and exploration activities 

morenci  we are advancing a feasibility study at morenci to process additional sulfide ore identified through exploratory drilling this project would increase milling rates from the current level of 50000 metric tons of ore per day to 115000 metric tons of ore per day and targets incremental annual copper production of approximately 225 million pounds within a threeyear timeframe completion of the feasibility study is expected in the first half of 2012 

twin buttes  in december 2009 we purchased the twin buttes copper mine which ceased operations in 1994 and is adjacent to our sierrita mine the purchase provides significant synergies in the sierrita minerals district including the potential for expanded mining activities and access to material that can be used for sierrita tailings and stockpile reclamation purposes we are conducting drilling on the property and metallurgical studies to support a feasibility study expected to commence in 2012 

cerro verde  plans for a largescale concentrator at cerro verde continue to be advanced the project will expand the concentrator facilities from the current level of 120000 metric tons per day to 360000 metric tons of ore per day targeting incremental annual production of approximately 600 million pounds of copper and 15 million pounds of molybdenum beginning in 2016 an environmental impact assessment was filed in fourthquarter 2011 

el abra  we are engaged in prefeasibility studies for a potential largescale milling operation at el abra to process additional sulfide material and to achieve higher recoveries exploration results at el abra indicate the potential for a significant additional sulfide resource 

grasberg  we have several projects in progress in the grasberg minerals district primarily related to the development of the largescale highgrade underground ore bodies located beneath and nearby the grasberg open pit in aggregate these ore bodies are expected to ramp up to approximately 240000 metric tons of ore per day following the currently anticipated transition from the grasberg open pit in 2016 

tenke  we are undertaking a second phase of the project in the tenke minerals district which includes optimizing the current plant and increasing capacity as part of the second phase we plan to expand the mill rate to 14000 metric tons of ore per day and to construct related processing facilities that would target the addition of approximately 150 million pounds of copper per year the project which includes mill upgrades additional mining equipment and a new tankhouse and sulphuric acid plant expansion is targeted for completion in 2013 

in addition to the nearterm development projects in progress in the grasberg minerals district we also have an additional longterm underground mine development project in the grasberg minerals district for the kucing liar ore body which lies on the southern flank of and underneath the southern portion of the grasberg open pit at the 2605meter elevation level we expect to mine the kucing liar ore body using the blockcave method aggregate capital cost estimates for development of the kucing liar ore body are projected to approximate 2 billion which are expected to be made between 2019 and 2031 additionally our current mine development plans include approximately 3 billion of capital expenditures at our processing facilities to optimize the handling of underground ore types once the grasberg openpit operations cease we expect substantially all of these expenditures to be made between 2016 and 2030 

considering the longterm nature and large size of our development projects actual costs and timing could differ materially from our estimates we continue to review our mine development and processing plans to maximize the value of our reserves 

smelting facilities 

atlantic copper sl  our wholly owned atlantic copper smelter and refinery is located on land concessions from the huelva spain port authorities which expire in 2027

our copper mining operations require significant energy principally diesel electricity coal and natural gas most of which is obtained from third parties under longterm contracts energy represented approximately 21 percent  of our 2011  consolidated copper production costs and included purchases of approximately 225 million gallons of diesel fuel 6475 gigawatt hours of electricity at our north america south america and africa copper mining operations we generate all of our power at our indonesia mining operation 650 thousand metric tons of coal for our coal power plant in indonesia and 1 million mmbtu million british thermal units of natural gas at certain of our north america mines for 2012 we estimate energy costs will approximate 23 percent  of our consolidated copper production costs 

sulphuric acid is used in the sxew process and is produced as a byproduct of the smelting process at our smelters and from our sulphur burners at the safford and tenke mines sulphuric acid needs in excess of the sulphuric acid produced by our operations are purchased from third parties as required 

our mining operations also require significant quantities of water for mining ore processing and related support facilities although we believe our mining operations have sufficient water rights the loss of water rights for any of our mines in whole or in part or shortages of water to which we have rights could require us to curtail or shut down mining operations for a further discussion of risks and legal proceedings associated with the availability of water refer to item 1a “risk factors” and item 3 “legal proceedings” 

competition 

the top 10 producers of copper comprise approximately 50 percent of total worldwide mined copper production we currently rank second among those producers at approximately nine percent of total worldwide estimated mined copper production our competitive position is based on the quality and grade of our ore bodies and our ability to manage costs compared with other producers we have a diverse portfolio of mining operations with varying ore grades and cost structures our costs are driven by the location grade and nature of our ore bodies and the level of input costs including energy labor and equipment the metals markets are cyclical and our ability to maintain our competitive position over the long term is based on our ability to acquire and develop quality deposits hire and retain a skilled workforce and to manage our costs 

labor matters 

at december 31 2011  we employed approximately 31800 people approximately 12300 in indonesia 11000 in north america 4800 in south america 2800 in africa and 900 in europe and other locations additionally we have contractors that have personnel at many of our operations including approximately 10500 at our grasberg   minerals district 11500 at our south america mining operations 3900 at our tenke fungurume minerals district 1500 in north america and 400 at atlantic copper 

employees represented by unions are listed below with the approximate number of employees represented and the expiration date of the applicable union agreements refer to item 1a risk factors for further information on labor agreements 



a negotiations are in progress while employees continue to work under the provisions of the expired contract 

environmental and reclamation matters 

the cost of complying with environmental laws is a fundamental and substantial cost of our business for information about environmental regulation litigation and related costs refer to item 1a “risk factors” and notes 1 and 13  

community and human rights 

we have adopted policies that govern our working relationships with the communities where we operate and are designed to guide our practices and programs in a manner that respects basic human rights and the culture of the local people impacted by our operations we continue to make significant expenditures on community development education training and cultural programs which include 

 

in december 2000 we endorsed the joint us state departmentbritish foreign office voluntary principles on human rights and security voluntary principles several major natural resources companies and international human rights organizations participated in developing the voluntary principles and have endorsed them we participated in developing these principles and they are incorporated into our human rights policy 

we believe that our social and economic development programs are responsive to the issues raised by the local communities near our areas of operation and should help us maintain good relations with the surrounding communities and avoid disruptions of mining operations nevertheless social and political instability in the areas of our operations may adversely impact our mining operations refer to item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

south america  cerro verde has provided a variety of community support projects over the years during 2006 as a result of discussions with local mayors in the arequipa region cerro verde agreed to contribute to the design and construction of domestic water and sewage treatment plants for the benefit of the region these facilities are being designed in a modular fashion so that initial installations can be readily expanded in the future 

additionally during 2006 the peruvian government announced that all mining companies operating in peru would be required to make annual contributions to local development funds for a fiveyear period covering the years 2006 through 2010 when copper prices exceeded certain levels that were adjusted annually the contribution which expired in 2010 was equal to 375 percent of aftertax profits and totaled 41 million in 2010 and 28 million in 2009 refer to note 14 for further discussion 

indonesia  in 1996 pt freeport indonesia established the freeport partnership fund for community development the partnership fund through which pt freeport indonesia has made available funding and technical assistance to support community development initiatives in the areas of health education and economic development of the area pt freeport indonesia has committed through 2016 to provide one percent of its annual revenue for the development of the local people in its area of operation through the partnership fund our share of contributions to the partnership fund totaled 50 million  in 2011  64 million  in 2010  and 59 million  in 2009  

the amungme and kamoro community development organization  lembaga pembangunan masyarakat amungme dan kamoro  or lpmak oversees disbursement of the program funds we contribute to the partnership fund lpmak is governed by a board of commissioners and a board of directors which are comprised of representatives from the local amungme and kamoro tribal communities government leaders church leaders and one representative of pt freeport indonesia on each board the amungme and kamoro people are original inhabitants of the land in our area of operations 

security matters    consistent with our cow in indonesia and the requirement to protect our employees and property we have taken appropriate steps to provide a safe and secure working environment as part of its security program pt freeport indonesia maintains its own internal security department which is unarmed and performs functions such as protecting company facilities monitoring the shipment of company supplies and products assisting in traffic control and aiding in emergency response operations the security department has received human rights training and each member is required to certify his or her compliance with our human rights policy 

pt freeport indonesia’s share of costs for its internal civilian security department totaled 37 million for 2011  28 

million for 2010  and 18 million for 2009  

pt freeport indonesia and all businesses and residents of indonesia rely on the indonesian government for the maintenance of public order upholding the rule of law and the protection of personnel and property the grasberg minerals district has been designated by the indonesian government as one of indonesia’s vital national assets this designation results in the police and to a lesser extent the military playing a significant role in protecting the area of our operations the indonesian government is responsible for employing police and military personnel and directing their operations 

from the outset of pt freeport indonesia’s operations the indonesian government has looked to pt freeport indonesia to provide logistical and infrastructure support and assistance for these necessary services because of the limited resources of the indonesian government and the remote location of and lack of development in papua pt freeport indonesia’s financial support for the indonesian government security institutions assigned to the operations area represents a prudent response to its requirements to protect its workforce and property better 

ensuring that personnel are properly fed and lodged and have the logistical resources to patrol pt freeport indonesia’s roads and secure its operating area in addition the provision of such support is consistent with pt freeport indonesia’s obligations under the cow reflects our philosophy of responsible corporate citizenship and is in keeping with our commitment to pursue practices that will promote human rights 

pt freeport indonesia’s share of support costs for the governmentprovided security was 14 million for each of the years 2011  and 2010  and 10 million for 2009  this supplemental support consists of various infrastructure and other costs such as food housing fuel travel vehicle repairs allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs and community assistance programs conducted by the military and police 

refer to item 1a risk factors for further discussion of security risks in indonesia 

africa  tfm has committed to assist the communities living within its concession in the katanga province of the drc initiatives include an integrated malaria control program construction and operational support for six elementary schools as well as renovation and construction of an additional four schools installation of over 70 clean water wells a public sanitation latrines and hand washing program reaching over 2000 households a mobile clinic for rural villages and economic development programs supporting microcredit and development of local entrepreneurs contractors and farmers we have also made significant investments in infrastructure in the region that will have lasting benefits to the country including upgrading a portion of a national road and the regional power generation and transmission systems 

tfm has also committed to contribute 03 percent of net sales revenue from production to a community development fund to assist the local communities with development of local infrastructure and related services this fund will be a platform to work jointly with the local government and community to further assist them to fulfill their local development plans meet basic community needs and promote good governance community development fund contributions totaled 4 million  in 2011  3 million  in 2010  and 1 million in 2009  

security matters  tfm maintains an unarmed internal security department the national government also has assigned mines police to the tfm concession area the mines police are a division of the congolese national police and are responsible for maintaining security in mining concessions throughout the drc tfm provides food housing monetary allowances and logistical support as well as direct payments to the government for the provision of the security assigned to the concession area the total cost to tfm for this support including inkind support totaled less than 1 million in each of the years 2011  2010  and 2009  

tfm also participates in monthly security coordination meetings with host country security personnel other mining companies and representatives from the united nations to discuss security issues and concerns 

ore reserves 

recoverable proven and probable reserves summarized below and detailed on the following pages have been calculated as of december 31 2011  in accordance with industry guide 7 as required by the securities exchange act of 1934 proven and probable reserves may not be comparable to similar information regarding mineral reserves disclosed in accordance with the guidance of other countries proven and probable reserves were determined by the use of mapping drilling sampling assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry as more fully discussed below the term “reserve” as used in the reserve data presented here means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination the term “proven reserves” means reserves for which 1 quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops trenches workings or drill holes 2 grade andor quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and 3 the sites for inspection sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established the term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced the degree of assurance although lower than that for proven reserves is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 

our reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies we conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk we revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies our estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves are prepared by and are the responsibility of our employees a majority of these estimates are reviewed and verified by independent experts in mining geology and reserve determination 

estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves at december 31 2011  were determined using longterm average prices of 200  per pound for copper 750  per ounce for gold 10  per pound for molybdenum 15  per ounce for silver and 10  per pound for cobalt for the threeyear period ended december 31 2011  lme spot copper prices averaged 325  per pound london pm gold prices averaged 1245  per ounce and the weekly average price of molybdenum quoted by metals week  averaged 1406  per pound the recoverable proven and probable reserves presented in the table below represent the estimated metal quantities from which we expect to be paid after application of estimated metallurgical recovery rates and smelter recovery rates where applicable recoverable reserves are the part of a mineral deposit that we estimate can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination 



 

  



 

the reserve table above and the tables on the following pages utilize the abbreviations described below

in defining our openpit reserves we apply a “variable cutoff grade” strategy the objective of this strategy is to maximize the net present value of our operations we use a breakeven cutoff grade to define the insitu reserves for our underground ore bodies the breakeven cutoff grade is defined for a metric ton of ore as that equivalent copper grade once produced and sold that generates sufficient revenue to cover all operating and administrative costs associated with our production 

our copper mines may contain other commercially recoverable metals such as gold molybdenum silver and cobalt we value all commercially recoverable metals in terms of a copper equivalent percentage to determine a single cutoff grade copper equivalent percentage is used to express the relative value of multimetal ores in terms of one metal the calculation expresses the relative value of the ore using estimates of contained metal quantities metals prices as used for reserve determination recovery rates treatment charges and royalties our molybdenum properties use a molybdenum cutoff grade 

the table below shows the minimum cutoff grade by process for each of our existing ore bodies as of december 31 2011  



drill hole spacing data is used by mining professionals such as geologists and geological engineers in determining the suitability of data coverage on a relative basis in a given deposit type and mining method scenario so as to achieve a given level of confidence in the resource estimate drill hole spacing is only one of several criteria necessary to establish resource classification drilling programs are typically designed to achieve an optimum sample spacing to support the level of confidence in results that apply to a particular stage of development of a mineral deposit 

the following table sets forth the average drill hole spacing based on average sample distance or drill pattern spacing for proven and probable ore reserves by process type 



production sequencing 

the following chart illustrates our current plans for sequencing and producing our proven and probable reserves at each of our ore bodies and the years in which we currently expect production from each ore body the chart also shows the term of pt freeport indonesia’s cow production volumes are typically lower in the first few years for each ore body as development activities are ongoing and as the mine ramps up to full production and production volumes may also be lower as the mine reaches the end of its life the ultimate timing of the start of production from our undeveloped mines is dependent upon a number of factors including the results of our exploration and development efforts and may vary from the dates shown below in addition we develop our mine plans based on maximizing the net present value from the ore bodies significant additional capital expenditures will be required at many of these mines in order to achieve the lifeofmine plans reflected below 

mill and leach stockpiles 

mill and leach stockpiles generally contain lower grade ores that have been extracted from the ore body and are available for copper recovery for mill stockpiles recovery is through milling concentrating smelting and refining or alternatively by concentrate leaching for leach stockpiles recovery is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities 

because it is generally impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count reasonable estimation methods are employed the quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grades of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles 

expected copper recovery rates for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing the recoverable copper in mill stockpiles once entered into the production process can be produced into copper concentrate almost immediately 

expected copper recovery rates for leach stockpiles are determined using smallscale laboratory tests small to largescale column testing which simulates the productionscale process historical trends and other factors including mineralogy of the ore and rock type ultimate recovery of copper contained in leach stockpiles can vary 

significantly from a low percentage to more than 90 percent depending on several variables including type of copper recovery mineralogy and particle size of the rock for newly placed material on active stockpiles as much as 70 percent of the copper ultimately recoverable may be extracted during the first year and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years 

processes and recovery rates are monitored continuously and recovery rate estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes following are our stockpiles and the estimated recoverable copper contained within those stockpiles as of december 31 2011  

 

mineralized material 

we hold various properties containing mineralized material that we believe could be brought into production should market conditions warrant however permitting and significant capital expenditures would be required before operations could commence at these properties mineralized material is a mineralized body that has been delineated by appropriately spaced drilling andor underground sampling to support the reported tonnage and average metal grades such a deposit cannot qualify as recoverable proven and probable reserves until legal and economic feasibility are confirmed based upon a comprehensive evaluation of development costs unit costs grades recoveries and other material factors estimated mineralized materials as presented on the following page were assessed using prices of 220  per pound for copper 1000  per ounce for gold and 12  per pound for molybdenum

this report contains “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of united states us federal securities laws forwardlooking statements are all statements other than statements of historical facts such as statements regarding projected ore grades and milling rates projected production and sales volumes projected unit net cash costs projected operating cash flows projected capital expenditures exploration efforts and results the impact of deferred intercompany profits on earnings liquidity other financial commitments and tax rates the impact of copper gold molybdenum and cobalt price changes availability of power water labor and equipment reclamation and closure costs and plans environmental liabilities and expenditures litigation contingencies and results dividend payments potential prepayments of debt reserve estimates and anticipated political economic and social conditions in our areas of operations we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements readers are cautioned that forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated projected or assumed in the forwardlooking statements important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements include the following 

financial risks 

extended declines in the market prices of copper gold andor molybdenum could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows and if sustained could adversely affect our ability to repay debt fluctuations in the market prices of copper gold or molybdenum can cause significant volatility in our financial performance and adversely affect the trading prices of our debt and equity securities 

our financial results vary as a result of fluctuations in metal market prices including copper gold and molybdenum for further information about the market prices of these commodities refer to discussion below and in item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” an extended decline in the market prices of these commodities could adversely affect our financial results affect our ability to repay our debt and meet our other fixed obligations and depress the trading prices of our common stock and of our publicly traded debt securities 

additionally if market prices for the metals we produce decline for a sustained period of time we may have to revise our operating plans including curtailing production reducing operating costs and capital expenditures and discontinuing certain exploration and development programs we may be unable to decrease our costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues and may incur losses 

substantially all of our copper concentrate and cathode sales contracts provide final copper pricing in a specified future month generally one to four months from the shipment date based primarily on quoted london metal exchange lme monthly average spot copper prices accordingly in times of rising copper prices our revenues benefit from adjustments to the final pricing of provisionally priced sales pursuant to contracts entered into in prior periods in times of falling copper prices the opposite occurs 

copper prices have fluctuated historically with lme spot copper prices ranging from 138  to 460 per pound during the three years ended december 31 2011  copper prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gold prices have also fluctuated historically with the london pm gold price ranging from 810 to 1895  per ounce during the three years ended december 31 2011 gold prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

molybdenum prices also fluctuate with the metals week molybdenum dealer oxide weekly average price ranging from 783 to 1860 per pound during the three years ended december 31 2011 molybdenum prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under us federal and state laws that require closure and reclamation plans for our mines we generally are required to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement those plans if we are unable to do so the us environmental protection agency epa and state agencies may seek financial assurance for investigation and remediation actions under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or equivalent state regulations   the failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse affect on us 

we are required by us federal and state laws to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans if we are unable to do so these laws are complex and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction the laws govern the determination of the scope and cost of the closure and reclamation obligations and the amount and forms of financial assurance 

epa and state agencies may seek financial assurance for investigation and remediation actions under cercla or equivalent state regulations in july 2009 epa published a priority notice of action identifying classes of facilities within the hardrock mining industry for which the agency will develop financial responsibility requirements concerning the degree and duration of risk associated with the production transportation treatment storage or disposal of hazardous substances in epas semiannual regulatory agenda published on february 13 2012 epa indicated that it intends to propose regulations regarding hardrock mining financial responsibility in april 2013 it is uncertain how the new requirements if promulgated will affect the amount and form of our existing and future financial assurance obligations 

the amount of financial assurance we are required to provide will vary with changes in laws regulations and reclamation and closure requirements and cost estimates as of december 31 2011  our financial assurance obligations associated with closure and reclamation costs in new mexico arizona and colorado totaled 899 million  of which 565 million  was in the form of parent company guarantees and financial capability demonstrations our ability to continue to provide financial assurance in the form of parent guarantees and financial capability demonstrations depends on our ability to meet financial tests certain of the ratios in these tests are significantly more rigorous for companies that do not have an investment grade rating from a stateapproved ratings service we are currently rated investment grade by standard  poors rating services sp fitch ratings and moodys investors service moodys if we fail to maintain our investment grade rating we would be subject to these more rigorous tests in which case the regulatory agencies may require us to provide alternative forms of financial assurance such as letters of credit surety bonds or collateral depending on our financial condition and market conditions these other forms of financial assurance may be difficult or costly to provide issuance of letters of credit under our credit facilities would reduce our available liquidity failure to provide the required financial assurance could result in the closure of mines as of december 31 2011  we had limited financial assurance obligations associated with cerclarelated remediation obligations although epa and certain states are currently considering increasing the use of financial assurance requirements for such obligations   for additional information see the environmental risk factor “mine closure regulations impose substantial costs on our operations” 

in july 2011 the chilean senate passed legislation regulating mine closure which establishes new requirements for closure plans and becomes effective in november 2012 our chilean operations will be required to update closure plans and provide financial assurance for these obligations we cannot predict at this time the costs of these closure plans or the levels or forms of financial assurance that may be required 

in december 2010 the president of indonesia issued a regulation regarding mine reclamation and closure which requires a company to provide a mine closure guarantee in the form of a time deposit placed in a stateowned bank in indonesia in accordance with its contract of work cow pt freeport indonesia is working with the department of energy and mineral resources to review these requirements including discussions of other options for the mine closure guarantee in december 2009 pt freeport indonesia submitted its revised mine closure plan to the department of energy and minerals resources for review and has addressed comments received during the course of this review process 

movements in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively affect our operating results 

the functional currency for most of our operations is the us dollar all of our revenues and a significant portion of our costs are denominated in us dollars however some costs and certain asset and liability accounts are denominated in local currencies including the indonesian rupiah australian dollar chilean peso peruvian nuevo sol euro and south african rand generally our results are positively affected when the us dollar strengthens in relation to those foreign currencies and adversely affected when the us dollar weakens in relation to those foreign currencies refer to item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for a summary of the estimated impact of changes in foreign currency rates on our annual operating costs 

from time to time we may implement currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange however our hedging strategies may not be successful and any of our unhedged foreign exchange payments will continue to be subject to market fluctuations 

international risks 

our international operations are subject to political social and geographic risks of doing business in foreign countries 

we are a global mining company with substantial assets located outside of the us we conduct international mining operations in indonesia peru chile and the democratic republic of congo drc accordingly in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in foreign countries our business may be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties in each of these countries such risks include 

   

 

 

 

 

 

our insurance does not cover most losses caused by the above described risks accordingly our exploration development and production activities outside of the us could be substantially affected by factors beyond our control some of which could materially and adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 

in october 2010 pt freeport indonesia received an assessment from the indonesian tax authorities for additional taxes of 106 million and interest of 52 million related to various audit exceptions for 2005 in november 2011 pt freeport indonesia received an assessment from the indonesian tax authorities for additional taxes of 22 million and interest of 10 million related to various audit exceptions for 2006 pt freeport indonesia has paid 109 million for these disputed tax assessments and filed objections to these assessments because it believes it has properly paid all taxes pt freeport indonesia is working with the indonesian tax authorities to resolve these matters and expects to receive additional assessments from the indonesian tax authorities for their audit of its 2007 tax return 

in december 2009 pt freeport indonesia was notified by the large taxpayers office of the government of indonesia of its view that pt freeport indonesia is obligated to pay value added taxes on certain goods imported after the year 2000 the amount of such taxes and related penalties under this view would be significant pt freeport indonesia believes that pursuant to the terms of its cow it is only required to pay value added taxes on these types of goods imported after december 30 2009 pt freeport indonesia has not received a formal assessment and is working with the applicable government authorities to resolve this matter 

sunat the peruvian national tax authority has assessed mining royalties on materials processed by the cerro verde concentrator which commenced operations in late 2006 these assessments cover the period october 2006 to december 2007 and the years 2008 and 2009 sunat has issued rulings denying cerro verdes protest of the assessments cerro verde has appealed these decisions and currently has three cases pending before the peruvian tax tribunal cerro verde is challenging these royalties because it believes its stability agreement provides an exemption for all minerals extracted from its mining concession irrespective of the method used for processing those minerals although we believe our interpretation of the stability agreement is correct if cerro verde is ultimately found responsible for these assessments it will also be liable for interest which accrues at rates that range from approximately 7 to 18 percent based on the year accrued and the currency in which the amounts would be payable at december 31 2011  the aggregate amount of the assessments including interest and penalties totaled 190 million sunat may continue to assess mining royalties annually until this matter is resolved by the peruvian tax tribunal 

because our grasberg minerals district is our most significant operating asset our business may continue to be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties and security risks in indonesia 

indonesia has faced political and social uncertainties including separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces in particular several separatist groups are opposing indonesian rule over the province of papua where our grasberg minerals district is located and have sought political independence for the province in response indonesia enacted regional autonomy laws which became effective january 1 2001 the manner in which those laws are being implemented and the degree of political and economic autonomy that they may bring to individual provinces including papua are uncertain and are ongoing issues in indonesian politics in papua there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the indonesian military social economic and political instability in papua could materially and adversely affect us if it results in damage to our property or interruption of our activities 

maintaining a good working relationship with the indonesian government is important to us because our mining operations there are among indonesias most significant business enterprises and are conducted pursuant to a cow with the indonesian government partially because of their significance to indonesias economy the 

environmentally sensitive area in which they are located and the number of people employed our operations are occasionally the subject of criticism in the indonesian press and in political debates and have been the target of protests and occasional violence 

between july 2009 and february 2012 there were 32 shooting incidents in and around the grasberg minerals district including along the road leading to our mining and milling operations which resulted in 15 fatalities and 56 injuries victims included pt freeport indonesia employees contractors members of law enforcement and civilians the identity of the perpetrators is unknown as is the motivation for the shootings the investigation of these matters is continuing we have taken precautionary measures including using secured convoys on the road the indonesian government has responded with additional security forces and expressed a commitment to protect the safety of the community and our operations prolonged limitations on access to the road could adversely affect operations at the mine the safety of our workforce is a critical concern and pt freeport indonesia is working cooperatively with the government of indonesia to address security issues 

during 2011 pt freeport indonesia was adversely affected by labor disruptions including an eightday work stoppage in july 2011 and an approximate threemonth strike that concluded in december 2011 the strike involved civil unrest transportation blockades sabotage of important operating facilities and violence although a new labor agreement was reached in middecember 2011 we are experiencing work interruptions in connection with our efforts to resume normal operations at pt freeport indonesia pt freeport indonesia is complying with the terms of the new labor agreement with its union certain of the returning workers have engaged in acts of violence and intimidation against workers and supervisory personnel who did not participate in the strike on february 23 2012 the union indicated that it will engage in a work stoppage and we temporarily suspended operations to protect our employees and assets following the incidents of intimidation and threats within the workforce we are working with union officials and government authorities to resolve the ongoing issues refer to item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further discussion 

large numbers of illegal miners have continued to operate along the river used to transport the tailings from the mill to the lowlands in pt freeport indonesias governmentapproved tailings management area the illegal miners have periodically clashed with police who have attempted to move them away from our facilities in 2006 the illegal miners temporarily blocked the road leading to the grasberg mine and mill in protest and pt freeport indonesia temporarily suspended mining and milling operations as a precautionary measure 

we cannot predict whether additional incidents will occur that could disrupt or suspend our indonesian operations if additional violence or other disruptive incidents occur it could adversely affect our business and profitability in ways that we cannot predict at this time 

we do not expect to mine all of our ore reserves in indonesia before the initial term of our cow expires 

pt freeport indonesia is entitled to mine in indonesia under its cow with the government of indonesia the initial term of the current cow expires in 2021 but can be extended for two 10year periods subject to indonesian government approval which pursuant to the cow cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably our proven and probable ore reserves in indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041 and our current mine plan has been developed and our operations are based on the assumption that we will receive the two 10year extensions as a result we will not mine all of these ore reserves during the initial term of the current cow and there can be no assurance that the indonesian government will approve the extensions prior to the end of 2021 we expect to mine 31 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable ore at december 31 2011 representing 37 percent of pt freeport indonesias share of recoverable copper reserves and 49 percent of its share of recoverable gold reserves 

in 2009 indonesia enacted a new mining law which will operate under a licensing system as opposed to the contract of work system that applies to pt freeport indonesia in 2011 and 2010 the government of indonesia promulgated regulations under the 2009 mining law and certain provisions address existing contracts of work the laws and regulations provide that contracts of work will continue to be honored until their expiration however the regulations attempt to apply certain provisions of the new law to existing contracts and may seek to apply the licensing system to any extension periods of contracts of work even though our cow provides for two 10year extension periods subject to indonesian government approval which pursuant to the cow cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably in february 2012 a new regulation was adopted that would require mining companies in indonesia to process all minerals domestically and possibly ban export of concentrates and other unrefined minerals there are specific provisions included in pt freeport indonesias existing cow that define its rights to 

export product and the obligation to develop domestic smelting capacity if commercially feasible or to contract with other domestic smelters on a market basis in connection with the obligations under its cow in 1995 pt freeport indonesia constructed the only copper smelter and refinery in indonesia which is owned and operated by pt smelting 

our cows in indonesia are subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations and if a dispute arises we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel 

pt freeport indonesias cow and other cows in which we have an interest were entered into under indonesias 1967 foreign capital investment law which provides guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization our cows can be terminated by the government of indonesia if we do not satisfy our contractual obligations which include the payment of royalties and taxes to the government and the satisfaction of certain mining environmental safety and health requirements 

certain forestry laws and designations as well as prevailing environmental laws and regulations may conflict with or overlap with the mining rights established under our cow although our cow grants to pt freeport indonesia the unencumbered right to operate in accordance with the cow certain government agencies could seek to impose additional restrictions on pt freeport indonesia that could affect exploration and operating requirements 

at times certain government officials and others in indonesia have questioned the validity of contracts entered into by the government of indonesia prior to may 1998  ie  during the suharto regime which lasted over 30 years including pt freeport indonesias cow which was signed in december 1991 we cannot provide assurance that the validity of or our compliance with the cows will not be challenged for political or other reasons pt freeport indonesias cow and our other cows require that disputes with the indonesian government be submitted to international arbitration accordingly if a dispute arises under the cows we face the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel and if we prevail in such a dispute we will face the additional risk of having to enforce the judgment of a foreign court or arbitration panel against indonesia within its own territory 

indonesian government officials have periodically undertaken reviews regarding our compliance with indonesian environmental laws and regulations and the terms of the cows in january 2012 the president of indonesia issued a decree calling for the creation of a team to evaluate contracts of work for adjustment to the 2009 mining law and accordingly to take steps to assess and negotiate size of work areas government revenues and domestic processing of minerals the team includes 14 cabinetlevel members representing 13 formal government institutions led by the coordinating minister of economy and the minister of energy and mineral resources with the director general of mineral and coal as the secretary the teams assignment runs through december 2013 and the group is expected to provide progress reports to the president every six months we intend to continue to work cooperatively with the government of indonesia to complete this review and to seek extension of the cow beyond 2021 as provided under the terms of the cow the cow can only be modified by mutual agreement between pt freeport indonesia and the government of indonesia 

any suspension of required activities under our cows requires the consent of the indonesian government 

our cows permit us to suspend certain contractually required activities including exploration for a period of one year by making a written request to the indonesian government these requests are subject to the approval of the indonesian government and are renewable annually if we do not request a suspension or are denied a suspension then we are required to continue our activities under the cow or potentially be declared in default moreover if a suspension continues for more than one year for reasons other than force majeure and the indonesian government has not approved such continuation then the government would be entitled to declare a default under the cow 

we previously suspended our field exploration activities outside of the block a area of pt freeport indonesias cow because of safety and security issues and regulatory uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest areas and an indonesian forestry law enacted in 1999 prohibiting openpit mining in forest preservation areas in 2001 we requested and received from the government of indonesia formal temporary suspensions of our obligations under the cows in all areas outside of block a recent indonesian legislation permits openpit mining in the block b area of pt freeport indonesias cow subject to certain requirements following an assessment of these requirements and a review of security issues in 2007 we resumed exploration activities in certain prospective cow areas outside of block a 

the tenke fungurume minerals district is located in the katanga province of the drc and may be adversely affected by political economic and social instability in the drc 

during 2009 we completed construction activities and commenced copper production at the tenke fungurume mine the tenke mine located in the drc since gaining independence in 1960 the drc has undergone outbreaks of violence changes in national leadership and financial crisis these factors heighten the risk of abrupt changes in the national policy toward foreign investors which in turn could result in unilateral modification of concessions or contracts increased taxation denial of permits or permit renewals or expropriation of assets as part of a review of all mining contracts by the ministry of mines the ministry in the drc in february 2008 we received notification that the ministry wished to renegotiate several material provisions of tenke fungurume mining sarls tfm mining concessions in october 2010 the government of the drc concluded its review of tfms existing mining contracts and confirmed that they are in good standing in connection with the review tfm made several commitments that have been reflected in amendments to its mining contracts which were signed by the parties in december 2010 refer to note 14 for further discussion in march 2011 the amendments were approved by a ministerial council and a presidential decree signed by the president and prime minister of the drc was issued in april 2011 after receiving the required government approval of the modification to tfms bylaws that reflect the agreement with the government of the drc our effective ownership interest in the project will be reduced to 560 percent prospectively compared to our current ownership interest of 5775 percent 

in november 2011 the drc held a general presidential election on december 16 2011 incumbent president joseph kabila was declared the winner of that election by the drc supreme court there has been widespread international and local criticism of the election and episodes of protests some of which were accompanied by acts of violence 

in july 2009 tfm was advised that the minister of justice in the drc authorized an inquiry regarding the alleged misappropriation of public funds in connection with securing labor and immigration authorizations and the payment of associated fees for the tenke fungurume project several government officials and three tfm employees were arrested in october 2009 the three tfm employees were tried and acquitted one government official the head of immigration in the katanga province was sentenced to five years imprisonment on charges of embezzlement the office of the attorney general of the drc filed a notice of appeal of the judgment and the matter is pending at the appellate court 

in july 2009 tfm entered into a settlement agreement with drc tax authorities in connection with an administrative audit regarding the payment of fees for work permits and visas for its foreign workers and subcontractors including shortterm workers pursuant to the agreement which covers the period from january 2007 to the date of the settlement tfm paid approximately 16 million in fees and penalties the procedures associated with obtaining labor and immigration authorizations for shortterm workers on a timely basis are not clearly established in the drc and tfm continues to work proactively and cooperatively with the government authorities to establish approved procedures for doing so consistent with its mining convention and local law in connection with this matter we notified the us government enforcement authorities about our internal investigation of the immigration work permit and visa matter and the associated criminal case we have received and responded to requests from us government authorities related to the matter and to other requests for information about our compliance program 

political economic and social risks that are generally outside of our control and could adversely affect our business include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accordingly the tenke fungurume minerals district and its future development projects may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control any of which could adversely affect our operating results interrupt our operations or result in a loss of all or part of our investment in the drc 

terrorist attacks and violence near our operations and throughout the world and the potential for additional future terrorist acts and violence have created economic and political uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business 

in july 2009 two suicide bombers set off explosions inside of the jw marriott and ritzcarlton hotels in jakarta indonesia that killed nine people and injured 53 others two of our indonesianbased executives were injured in the incident 

in july 2009 a small group of individuals created a disturbance on the road leading to our mining and milling operations at our grasberg minerals district and vandalized vehicles and small buildings there were no injuries for more information about a series of shooting incidents near our grasberg minerals district refer to the risk factor “because our grasberg minerals district is our most significant operating asset our business may continue to be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties in indonesia” 

in august 2002 three people were killed and 11 others were wounded in an ambush by a group of unidentified assailants on the road near tembagapura the mining town where the majority of pt freeport indonesias personnel reside the assailants shot at several vehicles transporting international contract teachers from our school in tembagapura their family members and other contractors to pt freeport indonesia the us federal bureau of investigation fbi investigated the incident which resulted in the us indictment of an alleged operational commander of the free papua movementnational freedom force in january 2006 indonesian police accompanied by fbi agents arrested the alleged operational commander and 11 other papuans in november 2006 verdicts and sentencing were announced for seven of those accused in the august 2002 shooting including a life sentence for the confessed leader of the attack 

in october 2002 a bombing killed 202 people in the indonesian province of bali which is 1500 miles west of our mining and milling operations indonesian authorities arrested 35 people in connection with this bombing and 29 of those arrested have been tried and convicted in august 2003 12 people were killed and over 100 were injured by a car bomb detonated outside of the jw marriott hotel in jakarta indonesia in september 2004 11 people were killed and over 200 injured by a car bomb detonated in front of the australian embassy in jakarta in october 2005 three suicide bombers killed 19 people and wounded over 100 in bali the same international terrorist organizations are suspected in each of these incidents in november 2005 indonesian police raided a house in east java that resulted in the death of other accused terrorists linked to the bombings discussed above our mining and milling operations were not interrupted by these incidents but pt freeport indonesias corporate office in jakarta had to relocate for several months following the bombing in front of the australian embassy in addition to the bali jw marriott hotel and australian embassy bombings there have been antiamerican demonstrations in certain sections of indonesia reportedly led by radical islamic activists 

no assurance can be given that additional terrorist incidents and acts of violence will not occur if there were to be additional terrorist incidents or acts of violence particularly at or near our operations there could be no assurance that the occurrence of such events would not have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

operational risks 

our business is subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our business 

mines by their nature are subject to many operational risks some of which are outside of our control these operational risks which could adversely affect our business operating results and cash flows include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the failure to adequately manage these risks could result in significant personal injury loss of life property damage and damage to the environment both in and around our areas of operations as well as damage to production facilities and delays in or curtailments of production 

labor unrest and activism could disrupt our operations and may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

as further described in items 1 and 2 “business and properties” we are party to labor agreements with various unions that represent employees at our operations labor agreements are negotiated on a periodic basis and the risk exists that labor agreements may not be renewed on reasonably satisfactory terms to us or at all we cannot predict what issues may be raised by the collective bargaining units representing our employees and if raised whether negotiations concerning those issues will be concluded successfully our production and sales volumes could be significantly reduced and our business financial condition and results of operations adversely affected by significant reductions in productivity or protracted work stoppages at one or more of our operations additionally if we enter into a new labor agreement with any union that significantly increases our labor costs relative to our competitors our ability to compete may be materially and adversely affected 

during 2011 pt freeport indonesia was adversely affected by labor disruptions including an eightday work stoppage in july 2011 and an approximate threemonth strike that concluded in december 2011 the strike involved civil unrest transportation blockades sabotage of important operating facilities and violence in middecember 2011 the financial terms of a new twoyear labor agreement for pt freeport indonesia were reached and the parties agreed that future wage negotiations would be based on living costs and the competitiveness of wages within indonesia although a new labor agreement has been reached we are experiencing work interruptions in connection with our efforts to resume normal operations at pt freeport indonesia pt freeport indonesia is complying with the terms of the new labor agreement with its union certain of the returning workers have engaged in acts of violence and intimidation against workers and supervisory personnel who did not participate in the strike on february 23 2012 the union indicated that it will engage in a work stoppage and we temporarily 

suspended operations to protect our employees and assets following the incidents of intimidation and threats within the workforce we are working with union officials and government authorities to resolve the ongoing issues refer to item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further discussion 

in fourthquarter 2011 there was an approximate twomonth labor strike at cerro verde during the negotiation of a new labor agreement the strike did not have a significant impact on production and a new threeyear agreement with the union was reached in late december 2011 

if we do not successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements with our union workers we may incur prolonged strikes and other work stoppages at our mining operations which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our mining production depends on the availability of sufficient water supplies 

our operations require significant quantities of water for mining ore processing and related support facilities our operations in north and south america are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant continuous production at our mines depends on our ability to maintain our water rights and claims 

at our north america operations our water rights give us only the right to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location in arizona we are a participant in two active general stream adjudications in which for over 30 years the state of arizona has been attempting to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for two of the states largest river systems that affect four of our operating mines morenci safford sierrita and miami the legal precedent set in these proceedings may also affect our bagdad mine groundwater has historically been treated separately from surface water under arizona law which has generally allowed land owners to pump at will subject to the doctrine of reasonable use however court decisions in recent years have concluded that if groundwater pumping produces or affects surface water then such pumping requires surface water rights and is subject to the general stream adjudications the effort to define the boundaries between groundwater and surface water is currently the focus of one of those adjudications 

in colorado our surface water and groundwater rights are subject to adjudication and we are involved in legal proceedings to resolve disputes regarding priority of administration of rights including priority of some of our rights for the climax molybdenum mine in new mexico our surface water and groundwater rights are fully licensed or have been fully adjudicated 

water for our cerro verde mining operation comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the rio chili watershed that collect water primarily from seasonal precipitation due to occasional drought conditions and the possibility that climate change will reduce precipitation levels temporary supply shortages are possible that could affect our current and planned cerro verde operations cerro verde has been conducting water studies to assess opportunities for additional supplies to support current operations and potential future expansion projects in 2011 cerro verde reached an agreement with the regional government of arequipa the national government servicio de agua potable y alcantarillado de arequipa sa sedapar and other local institutions to allow cerro verde to finance the engineering and construction of a wastewater treatment plant should it proceed with plans for a largescale concentrator expansion once cerro verde obtains a license for the treated water it would be used to supplement its existing water supplies to support the potential concentrator expansion 

water for our el abra mining operation comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascotán aquifer in 2010 el abra obtained regulatory approval subject to certain conditions for the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascotán aquifer for its sulfide processing plant which began operations in 2011 we believe that el abra has sufficient water rights to support current operations however a change to the sulfide ore project such as increased production or mill processing would require additional water beyond our sulfide groundwater pumping which is permitted through 2021 el abra is also conducting studies to assess the feasibility of constructing a desalination plant near the pacific ocean to treat seawater for possible increased sulfide ore production or mill processing 

water for our candelaria and ojos del salado mining operations is drawn from the copiapó river aquifer because of rapid depletion of this aquifer in recent years candelaria is expanding its sources of water supply during 2010 we completed construction of a pipeline to convey reclaimed water from a nearby water treatment facility to our 

candelaria mine we have also completed engineering and began construction for a desalination plant near the pacific ocean that will supply candelarias longer term water needs the plant is expected to be completed in early 2013 

although we believe each operation has sufficient water rights and claims to cover current operational demands we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings on our water rights claims and uses the loss of some or all water rights for any of our mines or physical shortages of water to which we have rights could require us to curtail or close mining operations and could prevent us from pursuing expansion opportunities 

increased production costs could reduce our profitability and cash flow 

our copper mining operations require significant energy principally diesel electricity coal and natural gas for the year 2011  energy represented approximately 21 percent  of our consolidated copper production costs an inability to procure sufficient energy at reasonable prices could adversely affect our profits cash flow and growth opportunities 

our consolidated copper production costs are also affected by the prices of commodities we consume or use in our operations such as sulphuric acid grinding media steel reagents liners tires explosives and diluents the prices of such commodities are influenced by supply and demand trends affecting the mining industry in general and other factors outside our control and such prices are at times subject to volatile movements increases in the cost of these commodities could make our operations less profitable increases in the costs of commodities that we consume or use may also significantly affect the capital costs of new projects 

in addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry our indonesia operations involve additional risks because they are located on unusually difficult terrain in a very remote area 

the grasberg minerals district is located in steep mountainous terrain in a remote area of indonesia because of these conditions we have had to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities in addition the area receives considerable rainfall which has led to periodic floods and mudslides the mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time our insurance may not sufficiently cover an unexpected natural or operating disaster 

in october 2003 a slippage of material occurred in a section of the grasberg open pit resulting in eight fatalities in december 2003 a debris flow involving a relatively small amount of loose material occurred in the same section of the open pit resulting in only minor property damage the events caused us to alter our shortterm mine sequencing plans normal production activities resumed in secondquarter 2004 

in march 2006 a mudtopsoil slide involving approximately 75000 metric tons of material occurred from a mountain ridge above service facilities supporting pt freeport indonesias mining facilities three contract workers were fatally injured in the event the material damaged a mess hall and an adjacent area as a result of investigations by pt freeport indonesia and the indonesian department of energy and mineral resources we conducted geotechnical studies to identify and address any potential hazards to workers and facilities from slides the existing early warning system for potential slides based upon rainfall and other factors has also been expanded 

in september 2008 a small scale failure encompassing approximately 75000 metric tons of material occurred at our grasberg open pit there were no injuries or property damage the event caused a delay in our access to the highgrade section of the open pit and as a result a portion of the metal expected to be mined in the second half of 2008 was deferred to future periods 

in april 2011 two pt freeport indonesia employees died in an accident when a portion of the deep ore zone doz mine experienced an uncontrolled muck flow the area was temporarily shut down during the investigation of the accident 

no assurance can be given that similar events will not occur in the future 

in addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry our africa mining operation involves additional risks because it is located in a remote area of the drc 

the tenke fungurume minerals district is located in a remote area of the drc and is subject to additional challenges including 

 

 

 

 

 

additionally due to limited rail access we currently truck a significant portion of the production from the tenke mine approximately 1900 miles to ports in south africa the tenke fungurume minerals district and its future development may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control which could adversely affect their contribution to our operating results and increase the cost of future development 

the volume and grade of ore reserves that we recover and our rate of production may be more or less than anticipated 

our ore reserve amounts are determined in accordance with industry guide 7 as required by the securities exchange age of 1934 and are estimates of the mineral deposits that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination the determination of reserves involves numerous uncertainties with respect to the ultimate geology of the ore bodies including quantities grades and recovery rates and estimates may change as new data becomes available estimating the quantity and grade of reserves requires us to determine the size shape and depth or our ore bodies by analyzing geological data such as samplings of drill holes tunnels and other underground workings in addition to the geology of our mines assumptions are required to determine the economic feasibility of mining these reserves including estimates of future commodity prices and demand the mining methods we use and the related costs incurred to develop and mine our reserves a sustained decrease in commodity prices may result in a reduction in economically recoverable ore reserves these factors may result in variations in the volumes of mineral reserves that we report from period to period 

there are also uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of ore reserves and copper recovered from mill and leach stockpiles the quantity of copper delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grade contained in the material delivered to the mill and leach stockpiles processes and recovery rates are monitored regularly and recovery rate estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes accordingly the volume and grade of ore reserves recovered rates of production and copper recovered from stockpiles may be less than anticipated 

we must continually replace reserves depleted by production our exploration activities may not result in additional discoveries 

our ability to replenish our ore reserves is important to our longterm viability produced ore reserves must be replaced by further delineation of existing ore bodies or by locating new deposits in order to maintain production levels over the long term exploration is highly speculative in nature our exploration projects involve many risks require substantial expenditures and may not result in the discovery of sufficient additional mineral deposits that can be mined profitably once a site with mineralization is discovered it may take several years from the initial phases of drilling until production is possible during which time the economic feasibility of production may change substantial expenditures are required to establish recoverable proven and probable reserves and to construct mining and processing facilities as a result there is no assurance that current or future exploration programs will be successful there is a risk that depletion of reserves will not be offset by discoveries or acquisitions 

development projects are inherently risky and may require more capital than anticipated which could adversely affect our business 

there are many risks and uncertainties inherent in all development projects the economic feasibility of development projects is based on many factors including the accuracy of estimated reserves metallurgical recoveries capital and operating costs and estimated future prices of the relevant minerals the capital expenditures and time required to develop new mines or other projects are considerable and changes in costs or construction schedules can adversely affect project economics moreover underground mining is generally more expensive than surface mining as a result of higher capital costs including costs for modern mining equipment and construction of extensive ventilation systems therefore it is possible that actual costs and economic returns may differ materially from our estimates refer to item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further discussion of our current development projects 

new development projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future cash flow these development projects also require the successful completion of feasibility studies acquisition of governmental permits acquisition of land power and water and ensuring that appropriate community infrastructure is developed by third parties to support such projects it is possible that we could fail to obtain the government approvals necessary for the operation of a project in which case the project may not proceed either on its original timing or at all it is not unusual for new mining operations to experience unexpected problems during the startup phase resulting in delays in producing revenue and increases in capital expenditures 

the development of underground mines is subject to additional risks including the following 

 

 

 

 

some of these risks could result in delays to production startup and a loss or reduction in minable tons there can be no assurance that the occurrence of such events or conditions would not have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

environmental risks 

our domestic and international operations are subject to complex and evolving environmental laws and regulations and compliance with environmental and regulatory requirements involves significant costs 

our mining operations and exploration activities both in the us and elsewhere are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing exploration development production occupational health mine safety toxic substances waste disposal protection and remediation of the environment protection of endangered and protected species and other related matters compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs which we expect will continue to increase over time because of increased regulatory oversight adoption of increasingly stringent environmental standards and increased demand for remediation services leading to shortages of equipment supplies and labor as well as other factors recent examples of these trends include epas june 2010 promulgation of a new sulphur dioxide ambient air standard and epas efforts to curtail the exemption of mining operations from waste management regulation under the federal resource conservation and recovery act these and other such actions could have a significant impact on our operational compliance and closure costs 

in addition to compliance with environmental regulation at our operating sites we incur significant costs for remediating environmental conditions on properties that have not been operated in many years 

freeportmcmoran corporation fmc formerly phelps dodge corporation and many of its affiliates and predecessor companies have been involved in mining milling and manufacturing in the us for more than a century activities that occurred in the late 19th century and the 20th century prior to the advent of modern environmental laws were not subject to environmental regulation and were conducted before american industrial 

companies understood the longterm effects of their operations on the surrounding environment with the passage of cercla in 1980 companies like fmc became legally responsible for environmental remediation on properties previously owned or operated by them irrespective of when the damage to the environment occurred or who caused it that liability is often shared on a joint and several basis with all other owners and operators meaning that each owner or operator of the property is fully responsible for the cleanup although in many cases some or all of the other historical owners or operators no longer exist do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found as a result because of our acquisition of fmc in 2007 many of the subsidiary companies we now own are responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the us and we expect to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address these remediation issues we are also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources at december 31 2011  we had more than 100  active remediation projects in the us in 27  states 

at december 31 2011  we had 15 billion  recorded in our consolidated balance sheet for environmental obligations attributed to cercla or analogous state programs and for estimated future costs associated with environmental matters at closed facilities or closed portions of certain operating facilities our environmental obligation estimates are primarily based upon 

 

 

 

significant adjustments to these estimates are likely to occur in the future as additional information becomes available the actual environmental costs ultimately may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs and any such changes could be material 

refer to note 13 for further discussion of our environmental obligations 

during 2011  we incurred environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs including our joint venture partners shares to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect our operations of 387 million  compared with 372 million  in 2010  and 289 million  in 2009  for 2012  we expect to incur approximately 636 million  of aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs the timing and amounts of estimated payments could change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements changes in scope and costs of reclamation activities and as actual spending occurs 

an adverse ruling in one or more pending legal proceedings involving environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on us 

as described in note 13 we are a defendant in numerous and in some cases significant litigation matters involving alleged environmental contamination alleged environmental toxic torts and complex interpretations of environmental regulations an adverse ruling in one or more of those matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

our indonesia mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges and future changes in environmental laws or unanticipated environmental impacts from those operations could require us to incur increased costs 

mining operations on the scale of our indonesia operations involve significant environmental risks and challenges our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of crushed and ground rock material called tailings that results from the process by which we physically separate the copper gold and silverbearing materials from the ore that we mine our tailings management plan which has been approved by the indonesian government uses the river system near our mine to transport the tailings to an engineered area in the lowlands where the tailings and natural sediments are managed in a deposition area lateral levees have been constructed to help contain the 

footprint of the tailings and to limit their impact in the lowlands 

another major environmental challenge is managing overburden which is the rock that must be moved aside in the mining process to reach the ore in the presence of air water and naturally occurring bacteria some overburden can generate acid rock drainage or acidic water containing dissolved metals which if not properly managed can adversely affect the environment 

from time to time certain indonesian government officials have raised questions with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans including a suggestion that we implement a pipeline system rather than our river transport system for tailings management and disposition because our indonesia mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area a pipeline system would be costly difficult to construct and maintain and more prone to catastrophic failure and could therefore involve significant potentially adverse environmental issues based on our own studies and others conducted by third parties we do not believe that a pipeline system is necessary or practical 

in connection with obtaining our environmental approvals from the indonesian government we committed to perform a onetime environmental risk assessment on the impacts of our tailings management plan we completed this extensive environmental risk assessment with more than 90 scientific studies conducted over four years and submitted it to the indonesian government in december 2002 we developed the risk assessment study using internationally recognized methods with input from an independent review panel which included representatives from the indonesian government academia and nongovernmental organizations the risks identified during this process were in line with our impact projections of the tailings management program contained in our environmental approval documents 

since 2005 pt freeport indonesia has participated in the government of indonesias proper program for pollution control evaluation and rating program in november 2011 the indonesian ministry of environment announced the latest results of its proper environmental management audit but did not provide a rating for pt freeport indonesia because of the strike and security conditions that existed during 2011 in 2010 the indonesia ministry of environment issued a blue rating acknowledging pt freeport indonesias environmental management practices as being in compliance with the laws and regulations in indonesia 

mine closure regulations impose substantial costs on our operations   

our us operations are subject to various federal and state permitting requirements that include mine closure and minedland reclamation obligations these requirements are complex and vary depending upon the jurisdiction the laws govern the determination of the scope and cost of the closure and reclamation obligations and the amount and forms of financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to meet the obligations of those plans if we are unable to do so in general our us mines are required to review estimated closure and reclamation costs on either a periodic basis or at the time of significant permit modifications and post increasing amounts of financial assurance as required it is uncertain how potential epa requirements for financial assurance will affect the timing of periodic closure cost reviews or the scope of closure activities 

  

our international mines are also subject to various mine closure and minedland reclamation laws in july 2011 the chilean senate passed legislation relating to mine closure which establishes new requirements for closure plans and becomes effective in november 2012 as a result our chilean operations will be required to update closure plans and provide financial assurance for these obligations we cannot predict at this time the costs of these closure plans or the levels or forms of financial assurance that may be required 

  

at december 31 2011  we had asset retirement obligations aros of 921 million  recorded in our consolidated balance sheet aro cost estimates may increase or decrease significantly in the future as a result of changes in closure or financial assurance regulations changes in engineering designs and technology permit modifications or updates changes in mine plans inflation or other factors and as actual reclamation spending occurs refer to note 13 for further discussion 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change issues may increase our costs and adversely affect our operations and markets 

many scientists believe that emissions from the combustion of carbonbased fuels contribute to greenhouse effects and therefore potentially contribute to climate change in 2011 our worldwide total greenhouse gas emissions measured as carbon dioxide equivalent emissions were approximately 10 million metric tons divided between direct 54 percent and indirect 46 percent emissions most of our direct emissions are from fuel combustion in haul trucks followed by the combustion of fuels to provide energy for roasting smelting and other processes indirect emissions are generally the emissions of outside providers from whom we purchase electricity for use in our operations approximately 56 percent of our direct emissions are in indonesia 28 percent in north america and 10 percent in south america approximately 58 percent of our indirect emissions are in north america and 40 percent in south america 

a number of governments have introduced or are contemplating regulatory initiatives designed to control and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the us several of these regulatory changes are being challenged at both the federal and state levels in september 2009 the epa issued final regulations requiring monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions in specified circumstances those regulations became effective in 2010 our miami smelter and el paso refinery have reported their emissions under this program in june 2010 the epa issued final regulations under the clean air act for the control of greenhouse gases from new large stationary sources and major modifications to existing large stationary sources certain of our operations including the miami smelter could be materially affected by these regulations as these regulations and anticipated epa regulations covering large fossil fuel fired power plants may materially increase energy costs at our operations several states have initiated action on their own or as part of regional organizations such as the western climate initiative to limit greenhouse gas emissions the us may also become a party to international agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions which could lead to new regulations affecting our us operations the december 1997 kyoto protocol established greenhouse gas emission targets for developed countries that ratified the protocol although the us has not ratified the kyoto protocol which expires in december 2012 the us continues to participate in global climate summits that may lead to an agreement in the future 

since 2006 we have participated in the carbon disclosure project which is a voluntary initiative that promotes standardized reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and reduction efforts in 2009 we formed a multidepartmental greenhouse gas task force to pursue ways to improve the energy efficiency of our operations and reduce greenhouse gas emissions including evaluating potential reductions in emissions from our haul trucks however because of longer and steeper mining hauls as our open pits expand and deepen and increases in use of electricity as we increase production capacity we expect increases in our total greenhouse gas emissions 

from a medium and longterm perspective we are likely to experience increased costs relating to our greenhouse gas emissions as a result of regulatory initiatives in the us and other countries in which we operate in addition the cost of electricity that we purchase from others may increase if our suppliers incur increased costs from the regulation of their greenhouse gas emissions we cannot predict the magnitude of any increased costs at this time given the wide scope of potential regulatory changes in the many countries in which we operate 

the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would vary by operation based on particular geographic circumstances these may include changes in rainfall patterns water shortages changing sea levels changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperatures these effects may adversely impact the cost production and financial performance of our operations 

our operating inactive and historical us mining sites and facilities may be subject to future regulation of radioactive materials that are commonly associated with or result from our mining operations 

federal and state agencies have considered proposing new regulations to characterize regulate and remediate potential workplace exposures and environmental impacts of radioactive materials commonly associated with mining operations for example the epa could promulgate rules to regulate technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive materials tenorm and their impacts at mining operations in addition several states are promulgating groundwater quality compliance and remediation standards for radioactive materials including uranium radioactive materials can be associated with copper mineral deposits including both our current and discontinued operations accordingly our copper operations may generate concentrate or release radioactive materials that may subject our operations to new and increased regulation the impact of such future regulation on our operating closure reclamation and remediation costs is uncertain 

other risks 

if market prices for our commodities decline the carrying values of inventories and longlived assets may be impaired which could require charges to operating income that could be material 

declines in the market price of copper among other factors could cause us to record lower of cost or market lcm inventory adjustments and could also result in a writedown of the carrying value of longlived assets which would potentially have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and stockholders equity but would have no effect on cash flows 

during fourthquarter 2008 we concluded that the thencurrent economic environment and significant declines in copper and molybdenum prices represented significant adverse changes in our business requiring us to evaluate our longlived assets and goodwill for impairment as a result we recorded significant impairment and lcm inventory charges refer to item 6 selected financial data for a summary of these charges 

unanticipated litigation or negative developments in pending litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are a party to the litigation described in note 13 and in item 3 “legal proceedings” and a number of other litigation matters including asbestos exposure cases disputes over the allocation of environmental remediation obligations at superfund and other sites disputes over water rights and disputes with regulatory authorities the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant monetary damages penalties or injunctive relief against us limitations on our property rights or regulatory interpretations that increase our operating costs if any of these disputes results in a substantial monetary judgment against us or an adverse legal interpretation is settled on unfavorable terms or otherwise affects our operations it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we depend on our senior management team and other key employees and the loss of any of these employees could adversely affect our business 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract retain and motivate senior management and other key employees achieving this objective may be difficult because of many factors including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions competitors hiring practices cost reduction activities and the effectiveness of our compensation programs competition for qualified personnel can be very intense we must continue to recruit retain and motivate senior management and other key employees to maintain our current business and support our future projects a loss of such personnel could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and our operating results could be adversely affected 

our holding company structure may impact your ability to receive dividends  

we are a holding company with no material assets other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries as a result our ability to repay our indebtedness and pay dividends is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend loan debt repayment or otherwise our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to make funds available to us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends dividends from subsidiaries that are not wholly owned are shared with other equity owners in addition cash at our international operations is subject to foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation into the us 

in addition our subsidiaries may not be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries assets upon their liquidation reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries creditors including any trade creditors 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult these provisions 

 

 

 

 

 

these provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our board of directors 

in addition because we are incorporated in delaware we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with or acquisition of us 

these provisions may deter an acquisition of us that might otherwise be attractive to stockholders

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in numerous legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business or are associated with environmental issues arising from legacy operations conducted over the years by freeportmcmoran corporation fmc  formerly phelps dodge corporation and its affiliates we are also involved periodically in other reviews investigations and proceedings by government agencies some of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief management does not believe based on currently available information that the outcome of any legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition although individual outcomes could be material to our operating results for a particular period depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period below is a discussion of our water rights legal proceedings refer to note 13 for discussion of our other legal proceedings 

water rights 

our operations in the western united states us require water for mining ore processing and related support facilities continuous operation of our mines is dependent on our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies in the arid western us water rights are often contested and disputes over water rights are generally timeconsuming expensive and not necessarily dispositive unless they resolve actual and potential claims the loss of a water right or continued use of a currently available water supply in whole or in part could have a material adverse effect on our mining operations 

each western state has its own set of complex laws governing the withdrawal and use of groundwater and surface water which are the sources of water supply for our operations in arizona a landowner has the right to pump 

groundwater beneath his property and put it to reasonable and beneficial use surface water in arizona is subject to the doctrine of prior appropriation first in time first in right and permits a holder of water rights to use surface water for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location in arizona potential claims are difficult to resolve because it is difficult to identify and join all potentially interested parties in a single legal proceeding global efforts to settle contested water rights in an entire watershed which are referred to as “adjudications” are complex multiparty judicial proceedings that can take decades to complete but are designed to resolve all actual and potential claims two water rights adjudications have been initiated in arizona in order to quantify and prioritize all surface water claims in two of the states river systems that could impact four of our operating mines morenci safford sierrita and miami any precedents set in these legal proceedings may also affect our bagdad mine these adjudications have been under way for many years and we cannot predict when they will be concluded or how the many conflicting claims will be resolved 

in re the general adjudication of all rights to use water in the little colorado water system and sources  apache county superior court no 6417 filed on or about february 17 1978 the principal parties in addition to us include the state of arizona the salt river project the arizona public service company the navajo nation the hopi indian tribe the san juan southern paiute tribe and the us on behalf of those tribes on its own behalf and on behalf of the white mountain apache tribe 

in re the general adjudication of all rights to use water in the gila river system and sources  

maricopa county superior court cause nos w1 salt w2 verde w3 upper gila and w4 san pedro this case was originally initiated in 1974 with the filing of a petition with the arizona state land department and was consolidated and transferred to the maricopa county superior court in 1981 the principal parties in addition to us include the state of arizona the gila valley irrigation district the franklin irrigation district the san carlos irrigation and drainage district the salt river project the san carlos apache tribe the gila river indian community gric and the us on behalf of those tribes on its own behalf and on behalf of the white mountain apache tribe the fort mcdowell mohaveapache indian community the salt river pimamaricopa indian community and the payson community of yavapai apache indians 

the last significant decision of the maricopa county superior court in the gila river adjudication was issued in 2005 and directed the arizona department of water resources adwr to prepare detailed recommendations regarding the delineation of the “subflow” zone of the san pedro river basin a tributary of the gila river which is the subsurface area adjacent to the river where the court may find that it is connected to the surface water such that pumping may reduce surface flows although we have minimal interests in the san pedro river basin a decision that recharacterizes groundwater in that basin as surface water will set a precedent for other river systems in arizona that could have material implications for many commercial industrial municipal and agricultural users of groundwater including our arizona operations 

adwrs recommendations were objected to by numerous parties on both sides of the issue and a threeday hearing was held in late january 2012 at which various parties provided testimony and oral argument regarding the strengths and weaknesses of adwrs technical approach to characterizing underground flows as groundwater or surface water given the legal and technical complexity of this adjudication its long history and its longterm legal and political implications it is difficult to predict the timing or the outcome of this issue or of the overall adjudication 

prior to january 1 1983 various indian tribes filed suits in the us district court in arizona claiming superior rights to water being used by many other water users including us and claiming damages for prior use in derogation of their allegedly superior rights these federal proceedings have been stayed pending the arizona superior court adjudications 

in 1998 we and several other parties entered into a water rights settlement agreement with gric one of the largest claimants in the adjudication that was later included in a comprehensive water rights settlement under the arizona water settlements act of 2004 the gric settlement is subject to contingencies and the comprehensive settlement has been challenged by other parties if we are unable to resolve the contingencies in the gric settlement and defeat the thirdparty challenges our water rights in the gila river watershed could be diminished and our operations at morenci safford sierrita and miami could be adversely affected 

united states v gila valley irrigation district  united states district court district of arizona was initiated in 1925 by the us to settle conflicting claims to water rights in portions of the gila river watershed a decree settling the claims of various parties was entered in 1935 after we were dismissed from the case without prejudice in 1988 the gric intervened challenging uses of water in the gila river watershed which may affect our ability to divert 

water from eagle creek chase creek or the san francisco river for operation of our morenci mine pursuant to decreed rights and an agreement between us and the gila valley irrigation district our morenci operations also purchased farm lands with water rights in 1997 1998 and 2008 that could be affected by the outcome of this proceeding impairment of our water claims in the gila river watershed could adversely affect the operations of our morenci and safford mines

general 

we are a leading international mining company with headquarters in phoenix arizona we are one of the world’s largest copper gold and molybdenum mining companies in terms of reserves and production prior to the march 2007 acquisition of phelps dodge our principal asset was the grasberg minerals district in indonesia which contains the largest single recoverable copper reserve and the largest single gold reserve of any mine in the world based on the latest available reserve data provided by thirdparty industry consultants following the acquisition of phelps dodge our portfolio of assets also includes significant mining operations in north and south america and the tenke fungurume minerals district in the democratic republic of congo drc 

we have significant reserves resources and future development opportunities within our portfolio of assets at december 31 2010 consolidated recoverable proven and probable reserves totaled 1205 billion pounds of copper 355 million ounces of gold 339 billion pounds of molybdenum 3250 million ounces of silver and 075 billion pounds of cobalt approximately 35 percent of our copper reserves are in north america 31 percent are in south america 27 percent are in indonesia and 7 percent are in africa approximately 95 percent of our gold reserves are in indonesia with our remaining gold reserves primarily in south america approximately 81 percent of our molybdenum reserves are in north america with our remaining molybdenum reserves in south america refer to “ore reserves” for further discussion 

we currently operate seven copper mines in north america – morenci bagdad safford sierrita and miami in arizona and tyrone and chino in new mexico molybdenum concentrate is also produced by bagdad and sierrita 

we operate four copper mines in south america – cerro verde in peru and el abra candelaria and ojos del salado in chile in addition to copper the cerro verde mine also produces molybdenum concentrate and the candelaria and ojos del salado mines produce gold and silver 

in indonesia pt freeport indonesia operates the mines in the grasberg minerals district in addition to copper the grasberg minerals district also produces gold and silver pt freeport indonesia also owns 25 percent of pt smelting a smelting and refining company in gresik indonesia 

in africa tenke fungurume sarl tfm operates the tenke fungurume tenke mine in addition to copper the tenke mine produces cobalt hydroxide 

during 2010 60 percent of our consolidated copper production was from our grasberg morenci and cerro verde mines the grasberg minerals district also accounted for 95 percent of our consolidated gold production for 2010 

we produce molybdenum at our henderson molybdenum mine in colorado during 2010 56 percent of our consolidated molybdenum production was from the henderson molybdenum mine 34 percent was produced at our bagdad and sierrita copper mines and 10 percent was produced at our cerro verde copper mine 

for information about our operating segments and financial data by geographic area refer to note 18 the locations of our operating mines are shown on the map below 

  

the diagram below shows our ownership interest in our operating mines at december 31 2010 

 

  

copper gold and molybdenum 

our mines primarily produce copper gold and molybdenum a brief discussion of these metals appears below for further discussion of the markets and prices of these metals refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

copper 

copper is an internationally traded commodity and its prices are determined by the major metals exchanges – new york mercantile exchange comex the london metals exchange lme and the shanghai futures exchange shfe prices on these exchanges generally reflect the worldwide balance of copper supply and demand and can be volatile and cyclical during 2010 lme spot copper prices averaged 342 per pound and ranged from 276 per pound to 442 per pound 

in general demand for copper reflects the rate of underlying world economic growth particularly in industrial production and construction according to brook hunt a widely followed independent metals market consultant copper’s enduse markets and their estimated shares of total consumption are 

 

gold 

gold is used for jewelry coinage and bullion as well as various industrial and electronic applications gold can be readily sold on numerous markets throughout the world benchmark prices are generally based on london bullion market association quotations during 2010 london gold prices averaged 1225 per ounce and ranged from 1058 per ounce to 1421 per ounce 

molybdenum 

molybdenum is a key alloying element in steel and the raw material for several chemicalgrade products used in catalysts lubrication smoke suppression corrosion inhibition and pigmentation molybdenum as a highpurity metal is also used in electronics such as flatpanel displays and in super alloys used in aerospace molybdenum’s enduse markets and their estimated shares of total consumption are 

 

reference prices for molybdenum are available in several publications including metals week  ryan’s notes and metal bulletin  during 2010 the weekly average price of molybdenum quoted by metals week averaged 1571 per pound and ranged from 1175 per pound to 1860 per pound 

products and sales 

fcx’s mining revenues for 2010 included sales of copper 78 percent gold 12 percent and molybdenum 6 percent pt freeport indonesia’s sales to pt smelting represented 12 percent of our consolidated revenues for 2010 13 percent in 2009 and 8 percent in 2008 no other customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated revenues in any of the past three years 

copper products 

we are one of the world’s leading producers of copper concentrate cathode and continuous cast copper rod during 2010 52 percent of our mined copper was sold in concentrate 26 percent as cathodes and 22 percent as rod principally from our north america operations 

  

  

our copper ores are generally processed either by smelting and refining or by solution extraction and electrowinning sxew before being subject to the smelting and refining process ore is crushed and treated to produce a copper concentrate with copper content of approximately 20 to 30 percent copper concentrate is then smelted subjected to extreme heat to produce copper anodes which weigh between 800 and 900 pounds each and have an average copper content of 995 percent the anodes are further treated by electrolytic refining to produce copper cathodes which weigh between 100 and 350 pounds each and have a copper content of 9999 percent our copper cathodes are used as the raw material input for copper rod brass mill products and for other uses 

for ore subject to the sxew process copper is extracted from the ore by dissolving it with a weak sulphuric acid solution the copper content of the solution is increased in two additional solutionextraction stages and then the copperbearing solution undergoes an electrowinning process to produce cathode that is 9999 percent copper 

copper concentrate  we produce copper concentrate at seven of our mines of which pt freeport indonesia is our largest producer in north america copper concentrate is produced at our morenci bagdad and sierrita mines and is generally shipped to our miami smelter in arizona in south america we produce copper concentrate at our cerro verde candelaria and ojos del salado mines 

copper cathode  we produce copper cathode at two electrolytic refineries located in el paso texas and huelva spain and at ten of our mines in north america sxew cathode is produced from our morenci bagdad safford sierrita miami tyrone and chino mines in south america from our cerro verde and el abra mines and from our tenke mine in africa  pt smelting also produces copper cathode 

continuous cast copper rod  we manufacture continuous cast copper rod at our facilities in el paso texas norwich connecticut and miami arizona primarily using copper cathode produced at our north america mines 

other copper products  we produce specialty copper products at our bayway operations in elizabeth new jersey these products include specialty copper alloys in the forms of rod bar and strip we manufacture electrode wire for use in welding steel cans at our norwich connecticut and el paso texas facilities we also produce copper sulfate pentahydrate for use in agricultural and industrial applications at our facility in sierrita arizona all of these facilities primarily use copper cathode produced at our north america mines to manufacture their end products 

copper sales 

north america  the majority of the copper produced at our north america copper mines and refined in our el paso texas refinery is consumed at our rod plants the remainder of our north america copper production is sold in the form of copper cathode or copper concentrate to third parties generally copper rod and cathode are sold to wire and cable fabricators and brass mills under united states us dollardenominated annual contracts cathode and rod contract prices are generally based on the prevailing comex monthly average spot price for the month of shipment and include a premium 

south america    production from our south america mines is sold as copper concentrate or copper cathode to third parties under us dollardenominated annual and multiyear contracts our south america mines sell approximately 60 percent of their copper production in concentrate and the rest as cathode during 2010 16 percent of our south america mines concentrate was sold at market rates to atlantic copper our wholly owned copper smelting and refining unit in spain 

substantially all of south america’s copper concentrate and cathode sales provide final copper pricing in a specified future period generally one to four months from the shipment date based on quoted lme monthly average spot prices revenues from south america’s concentrate sales are recorded net of treatment and refining charges which represent fees paid to smelters and refiners that are generally negotiated annually in addition because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrates is unrecoverable from the smelting process revenues from south america’s concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances for unrecoverable metals these allowances are a negotiated term of our contracts and vary by customer 

indonesia    pt freeport indonesia sells its production in the form of copper concentrate which contains significant quantities of gold and silver under us dollardenominated longterm contracts pt freeport indonesia also sells a small amount of copper concentrates in the spot market 

 

  

pt freeport indonesia and our south america mines provide atlantic copper with approximately 50 to 60 percent of its current concentrate requirements at market prices pt freeport indonesia also has a contract to provide pt smelting with the supply of 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements necessary to produce 205000 metric tons of copper annually on a priority basis refer to “smelting facilities” for further discussion 

during 2010 57 percent of pt freeport indonesia’s concentrate was sold to pt smelting and atlantic copper we anticipate that pt freeport indonesia will sell approximately 60 percent of its concentrate to pt smelting and atlantic copper in 2011 a summary of pt freeport indonesia’s aggregate percentage concentrate sales to pt smelting atlantic copper and to other third parties for the last three years follows 

 

substantially all of pt freeport indonesia’s concentrate sales provide final copper pricing in a specified future period generally one to four months from the shipment date based on quoted lme monthly average spot prices revenues from pt freeport indonesia’s concentrate sales are recorded net of royalties and treatment and refining charges including price participation charges if applicable based on the market prices of metals pt freeport indonesia’s concentrate sales are also net of allowances for unrecoverable metals 

africa  production from our tenke mine is sold as copper cathode under us dollardenominated contracts substantially all of tenke’s cathode sales provide final copper pricing in the month after the shipment date based on quoted lme monthly average spot prices revenues from tenke’s cathode sales are recorded net of royalties and also include adjustments for pointofsale transportation cost that are negotiated in customer contracts 

europe    atlantic copper sells copper cathode directly to rod and brass mills primarily located in europe atlantic copper has occasionally sold copper cathode to merchants copper cathode is generally sold under annual contracts and priced based on the lme average spot price for the month of arrival at the buyer’s facilities 

gold products and sales 

we also produce gold primarily at the grasberg minerals district which accounted for 95 percent of our consolidated gold production in 2010 gold is primarily sold as a component of our copper concentrate or in slimes which are a byproduct of the smelting and refining process gold generally is priced at the average london bullion market association price for a specified month near the month of shipment revenues from gold sold as a component of our copper concentrate are recorded net of treatment and refining charges revenues from gold sold in slimes are recorded net of refining charges 

molybdenum products and sales 

we are the world’s largest producer of molybdenum and molybdenumbased chemicals in addition to production from our henderson molybdenum mine we produce molybdenum concentrate primarily at our bagdad and sierrita copper mines in north america and at our cerro verde copper mine in south america during 2010 56 percent of our consolidated molybdenum production was from the henderson molybdenum mine 34 percent was from the north america copper mines and 10 percent was produced in south america 

the majority of our molybdenum concentrates are processed in our own conversion facilities technicalgrade oxide is produced from molybdenum concentrates in sierrita arizona fort madison iowa and rotterdam the netherlands ferromolybdenum is produced from technicalgrade oxide in stowmarket united kingdom through a metallothermic reduction process highquality molybdenum concentrates are converted into molybdenum chemicals at fort madison and rotterdam molybdenum generally is priced based on the average metals week price for the month prior to the month of shipment approximately 90 percent of our expected 2011 molybdenum sales are expected to be priced at prevailing market prices 

cobalt silver and other products and sales 

we produce cobalt hydroxide at the tenke mine cobalt hydroxide is priced at a discount to the average monthly low price published by metal bulletin for a specified month near the month of shipment we produce silver as a component of our copper concentrate or in slimes silver generally is priced at the average london bullion market association price for a specified month near the month of shipment sales of cobalt hydroxide silver and other 

  

  

  

metals such as rhenium and magnetite do not represent a significant component of our total revenues 

for an allocation of our consolidated revenues by geographic area refer to note 18 

mines 

following are maps and descriptions of our mining operations in north america including both copper and molybdenum operations south america indonesia and africa 

north america 

in the us most of the land occupied by our copper and molybdenum mines concentrators sxew facilities smelter refinery rod mills molybdenum roasters and processing facilities is generally owned by us or is located on unpatented mining claims owned by us certain portions of our bagdad sierrita miami tyrone chino cobre and henderson operations are located on governmentowned land and are operated under a mine plan of operations or other use permit various federal and state permits or leases on government land are held for purposes incidental to mine operations 

 

morenci 

 

we own an 85 percent undivided interest in morenci with the remaining 15 percent owned by affiliates of sumitomo corporation each partner takes in kind its share of morenci’s production

in 2008 indonesia enacted a new mining law which will operate under a licensing system as opposed to the cow system that applies to pt freeport indonesia eastern minerals and ptnbm in 2010 the government of indonesia promulgated regulations under the 2008 mining law and certain provisions address existing cows the regulations provide that cows will continue to be honored until their expiration however the regulations attempt to apply certain provisions of the new law to existing cows and to convert any existing cows to licenses for any extension periods provided by the applicable cow even though our cows provide for two 10year extension periods under the existing terms of our cows 

grasberg minerals district pt freeport indonesia operates in the remote highlands of the sudirman mountain range in the province of papua indonesia which is on the western half of the island of new guinea we and our predecessors have conducted exploration and mining operations in block a since 1967 and have been the only operator of these operations the grasberg minerals district currently has three mines in operation the grasberg open pit the deep ore zone doz underground block cave and the big gossan open stoping mine we also have significant development projects in the grasberg minerals district which are discussed in more detail in “development projects and exploration” and in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations” 

pt freeport indonesia’s production including our joint venture partner’s share totaled 13 billion pounds of copper and 20 million ounces of gold in 2010 16 billion pounds of copper and 30 million ounces of gold in 2009 and 11 billion pounds of copper and 12 million ounces of gold in 2008 

our principal source of power for all our indonesian operations is a coalfired power plant that we built in conjunction with our fourth concentrator mill expansion diesel generators supply peaking and backup electrical power generating capacity a combination of naturally occurring mountain streams and water derived from our underground operations provides water for our operations our indonesian operations are in an active seismic zone and experience average annual rainfall of approximately 200 inches 

grasberg open pit 

we began openpit mining of the grasberg ore body in 1990 openpit operations are expected to continue through mid 2016 at which time underground mining operations are scheduled to begin at our grasberg block cave mine which is currently in development   production in the openpit is currently at the 3265 to 3940 meter elevation level and totaled 53 million metric tons of ore in 2010 and 57 million metric tons of ore in 2009 which provided 63 percent of our 2010 mill feed and 70 percent of our 2009 mill feed remaining mill feed comes from our doz and big gossan mines 

the current equipment fleet consists of over 500 units the larger mining equipment directly associated with production includes an available fleet of 163 haul trucks with payloads ranging from approximately 215 metric tons to 330 metric tons and 18 shovels with bucket sizes ranging from 30 cubic meters to 42 cubic meters which during 2010 moved an average of 701000 metric tons per day 

grasberg crushing and conveying systems are integral to the mine and provide the capacity to transport up to 225000 metric tons per day of grasberg ore to the mill and 135000 metric tons per day of overburden to the overburden stockpiles the remaining ore and overburden is moved by haul trucks 

 

  

deep ore zone doz 

the doz ore body lies vertically below the now depleted intermediate ore zone we began production from the doz ore body in 1989 using open stope mining methods but suspended production in 1991 in favor of production from the grasberg deposit production resumed in september 2000 using the blockcave method production is at the 3110meter elevation level and totaled 29 million metric tons of ore in 2010 and 26 million metric tons in 2009 production at the doz mine is expected to continue through 2019 beginning in 2015 we plan to ramp up production at our deep mill level zone dmlz block cave mine which is currently under development 

during 2010 we completed over 10000 meters of development drifting in support of the blockcave mining method for the doz mine the expansion of the doz operation to 80000 metric tons of ore per day is complete the success of the development of the doz mine one of the world’s largest underground mines provides confidence in the future development of pt freeport indonesia’s largescale undeveloped underground ore bodies 

the doz mine fleet consists of over 195 pieces of mobile heavy equipment which in 2010 moved an average of 80000 metric tons of ore per day the primary mining equipment directly associated with production and development includes an available fleet of 52 lhd units and 25 haul trucks our production lhd units typically carry approximately 11 metric tons of ore using ore passes and chutes the lhd units transfer ore into 55ton capacity haul trucks the trucks dump into two gyratory crushers and the ore is then conveyed to the surface stockpiles 

big gossan 

the big gossan mine lies underground and adjacent to the current mill site and is a skarn hosted copper gold and silver deposit it is a tabular near vertical ore body with approximate dimensions of 1200 meters along strike and 800 meters down dip with varying thicknesses from 20 meters to 120 meters the mine utilizes a blasthole stoping method with delayed paste backfill stopes of varying sizes are mined and the ore dropped down passes to a truck haulage level trucks are chute loaded and transport the ore to a jaw crusher the crushed ore is then hoisted vertically via a two skip production shaft to a level where it is loaded onto a conveyor belt the belt carries the ore to one of the main underground conveyors where the ore is transferred and carried to the surface mill stockpile for processing 

production began in fourthquarter 2010 and is designed to ramp up to 7000 metric tons per day by late 2012 which will result in average annual aggregate incremental production of 125 million pounds of copper and 65 thousand ounces of gold with pt freeport indonesia receiving 60 percent of these amounts 

description of ore bodies  our indonesia ore bodies are located within and around two main igneous intrusions the grasberg monzodiorite and the ertsberg diorite the host rocks of these ore bodies include both carbonate and clastic rocks that form the ridge crests and upper flanks of the sudirman range and the igneous rocks of monzonitic to dioritic composition that intrude them the igneoushosted ore bodies the grasberg open pit and block cave and portions of the doz block cave occur as vein stockworks and disseminations of copper sulfides dominated by chalcopyrite and to a much lesser extent bornite the sedimentaryrock hosted ore bodies portions of the doz and all of the big gossan occur as “magnetiterich calciummagnesian skarn” replacements whose location and orientation are strongly influenced by major faults and by the chemistry of the carbonate rocks along the margins of the intrusions 

the copper mineralization in these skarn deposits is dominated by chalcopyrite but higher bornite concentrations are common moreover gold occurs in significant concentrations in all of the district’s ore bodies though rarely visible to the naked eye these gold concentrations usually occur as inclusions within the copper sulfide minerals though in some deposits these concentrations can also be strongly associated with pyrite 

  

the following diagram indicates the relative elevations in meters of our reported ore bodies 

the following map which encompasses an area of approximately 42 square kilometers approximately 16 square miles indicates the relative positions and sizes of our reported ore bodies and their locations

we currently own an effective 5775 percent interest in the tenke fungurume minerals district the remaining ownership interests are held by lundin mining corporation lundin currently an effective 2475 percent interest and la générale des carrières et des mines gécamines which is wholly owned by the government of the drc currently 175 percent nondilutable interest 

we are entitled to mine in the drc under the amended and restated mining convention armc between tfm and the government of the drc the original mining convention was entered into in 1996 and was replaced with the armc in 2005 as further discussed in note 14 in october 2010 the government of the drc announced the conclusion of the review of tfm’s contracts and confirmed that the existing mining contracts are in good standing and acknowledged the rights and benefits granted under those contracts in connection with the review tfm made several commitments that have been reflected in amendments to its mining contracts refer to note 14 for further discussion in december 2010 the addenda to tfm’s armc and amended and restated shareholders’ agreement were signed by the parties and are pending a presidential decree tfm’s existing mining contracts will be in effect until the presidential decree is obtained after giving effect to the amendments and obtaining approval of the modification to tfm’s bylaws our effective ownership interest in the project will be 560 percent 

tfm pays a royalty of 2 percent of net revenues under the armc which totaled 20 million in 2010 and 7 million in 2009 

the tenke fungurume deposits are located in the katanga province of the drc approximately 110 miles northwest of lubumbashi the deposits are accessible by unpaved roads and by rail the tenke fungurume deposits are sedimenthosted copper and cobalt deposits with oxide mixed oxidesulfide and sulfide mineralization the dominant oxide minerals are malachite pseudomalachite and heterogenite important sulfide minerals consist of bornite carrollite chalcocite and chalcopyrite 

initial copper production commenced at the tenke fungurume mine in late march 2009 targeted copper production rates were achieved in september 2009 and the cobalt and sulphuric acid plants were commissioned in thirdquarter 2009 copper and cobalt are recovered through an agitationleach plant the milling facilities at tenke which were designed to produce at a capacity rate of 8000 metric tons of ore per day have been performing above capacity with mill throughput averaging 10300 metric tons of ore per day in 2010 the current equipment fleet includes one twelvecubic meter frontend loader ten 5cubic meter frontend loaders four 91metric ton haul trucks twentynine 45metric ton haul trucks surface miners production drills sampling machines and crawler dozers 

we are planning a second phase of the project which would include optimizing the current plant and increasing capacity as part of the second phase a range of nearterm expansion options are being considered which have the potential of adding 100 million to 200 million pounds of copper per year over the next two to three years future expansions are subject to a number of factors including economic and market conditions and the business and investment climate in the drc 

 

  

tenke’s production totaled 265 million pounds of copper and 20 million pounds of cobalt in 2010 and 154 million pounds of copper in 2009 

tenke fungurume is located in a tropical region however temperatures are moderated by its higher altitudes weather in this region is characterized by a dry season and a wet season each lasting about six months with average rainfall of 47 inches per year the highest bench elevation is expected to be 1490 meters above sea level and the ultimate pit bottom is expected to be 1270 meters above sea level the tenke fungurume deposits are located within four concessions totaling 394455 acres 

tenke fungurume has entered into longterm power supply and infrastructure funding agreements with la société nationale d’electricité the stateowned electric utility company serving the region the results of a recent water exploration program as well as the regional geological and hydrogeological conditions indicate that adequate water is available for the project and for hydroelectric generation during the expected life of the operation

development projects and exploration 

 

we are increasing nearterm production at several of our copper mines and also have several projects and potential opportunities to expand production volumes extend mine lives and develop largescale underground ore bodies major development projects currently include the development of the massive underground ore bodies in the grasberg minerals district the el abra sulfide reserves and the development of the climax molybdenum mine studies are under way to evaluate a largescale concentrator expansion at cerro verde a major mill project at el abra various mill projects to process sulfide ore in north america and staged expansion options at tenke for further discussion of these and our other development projects and exploration activities refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

in addition to the development projects in progress in the grasberg minerals district we also have an additional longterm underground mine development project in the grasberg minerals district for the kucing liar ore body which lies on the southern flank of and underneath the southern portion of the grasberg open pit at the 2605meter elevation level we expect to mine the kucing liar ore body using the blockcave method aggregate capital cost estimates for development of the kucing liar ore body are expected to approximate 2 billion 

over the next five years we estimate aggregate capital spending for underground mine development in the grasberg minerals district to average approximately 600 million per year these costs will be shared with rio tinto in accordance with our joint venture agreement considering the longterm nature and large size of these projects actual costs could differ materially from these estimates 

in addition to the mine development costs above our current mine development plans include approximately 3 billion of capital expenditures at our processing facilities to optimize the handling of underground ore types once grasberg openpit operations cease substantially all of these expenditures will be made between 2016 and 2030 we continue to review our mine development and processing plans to maximize the value of our reserves 

smelting facilities 

atlantic copper sa our wholly owned atlantic copper smelter and refinery is located on land concessions from the huelva spain port authorities which expire in 2027 

the design capacity of the smelter is 290000 metric tons of copper per year and the refinery currently has a capacity of 265000 metric tons of copper per year during 2010 atlantic copper treated 980700 metric tons of concentrate and scrap and produced 255000 metric tons of copper anodes and 253100 metric tons of copper cathodes during 2009 atlantic copper treated 1000700 metric tons of concentrate and scrap and produced 269000 metric tons of copper anodes and 256600 metric tons of copper cathodes 

atlantic copper has a 21day maintenance turnaround scheduled in april 2011 atlantic copper’s last shutdown was in 2007 when it completed a scheduled 23day maintenance turnaround major maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately every 12 years for atlantic copper with significantly shorter term maintenance turnarounds occurring in the interim 

during 2010 atlantic copper purchased 28 percent of its concentrate requirements from pt freeport indonesia and 25 percent from our south america mines at market prices 

we made no capital contributions to atlantic copper from 2005 through 2010 we loan funds to atlantic copper from time to time and at december 31 2010 these loans totaled 411 million our net investment in atlantic copper was approximately 22 million at december 31 2010 

pt smelting  pt freeport indonesia’s 1991 cow required us to construct or cause to be constructed a smelter in indonesia if we and the indonesian government determined that such a project would be economically viable in 1995 following the completion of a feasibility study we entered into agreements relating to the formation of pt smelting an indonesian company and the construction of the copper smelter and refinery in gresik indonesia pt freeport indonesia mitsubishi materials corporation mitsubishi materials mitsubishi corporation unimetals ltd mitsubishi and nippon mining  metals co ltd nippon own 25 percent 605 percent 95 percent and 5 percent respectively of the outstanding pt smelting common stock pt smelting owns and operates the smelter and refinery in gresik indonesia 

  

  

pt freeport indonesia’s contract with pt smelting provides for the supply of 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements necessary for pt smelting to produce 205000 metric tons of copper annually on a priority basis pt freeport indonesia also sells copper concentrate to pt smelting at market rates which are not subject to a minimum or maximum rate for quantities in excess of 205000 metric tons of copper annually refer to note 2 for further discussion of our investment in pt smelting 

during 2006 pt smelting completed an expansion of its production capacity to 275000 metric tons of copper per year during 2010 pt smelting treated 1034800 metric tons of concentrate and produced 262700 metric tons of copper anodes and 277500 metric tons of copper cathodes during 2009 pt smelting treated 1073900 metric tons of concentrate and produced 310200 metric tons of copper anodes and 286000 metric tons of copper cathodes 

in 2008 pt smelting completed a scheduled 25day maintenance turnaround major maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately every four years for pt smelting with significantly shorter term maintenance turnarounds in the interim 

miami smelter  we own and operate a smelter at our miami arizona mining operation the smelter has been in production for over 80 years and has been upgraded during that period to implement new technologies to improve production and to comply with air quality requirements additionally there are new air regulations that may require the miami smelter to implement new technologies to meet these requirements refer to item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

the miami smelter processes concentrate primarily from our arizona copper mines concentrate processed through the smelter totaled approximately 625000 metric tons in 2010 and 619000 metric tons in 2009 in addition because sulphuric acid is a byproduct of smelting concentrates the miami smelter is also the most significant source of sulphuric acid for our north america leaching operations 

the miami smelter has a 30day maintenance shutdown scheduled in june 2011 major maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately every 14 months for the miami smelter with significantly shorter term maintenance turnarounds in the interim

in addition our wholly owned subsidiary fm services company fm services provides certain executive technical administrative accounting financial tax and other services to us and to mmr on a costreimbursement basis refer to part iii item 13 “certain relationships and related transactions and director independence” for additional information 

sources and availability of raw materials 

our copper mining operations require significant energy principally electricity diesel coal and natural gas most of our energy is obtained from third parties under longterm contracts for additional information refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

sulphuric acid is used in the sxew process and is produced as a byproduct of the smelting process at our smelters and from our sulphur burner at the tenke mine in addition we are completing construction of a sulphur burner at our safford mine which will provide a more costeffective source of sulphuric acid used in our north america sxew operations sulphuric acid needs in excess of the sulphuric acid produced by our operations are purchased from third parties as required 

our mining operations also require significant quantities of water for mining ore processing and related support facilities although we believe our mining operations have sufficient water rights the loss of water rights for any of our mines in whole or in part or shortages of water to which we have rights could require us to curtail or shut down mining operations for a further discussion of risks and legal proceedings associated with the availability of water refer to item 1a “risk factors” and item 3 “legal proceedings” 

competition 

the top 10 producers of copper comprise approximately 50 percent of total worldwide mined copper production we currently rank second among those producers at approximately 9 percent of total worldwide estimated mined copper production our competitive position is based on the quality and grade of our ore bodies and our ability to manage costs compared with other producers we have a diverse portfolio of mining operations with varying ore grades and cost structures our costs are driven by the location grade and nature of our ore bodies and the level of input costs including energy labor and equipment the metals markets are cyclical and our ability to maintain our competitive position over the long term is based on our ability to acquire and develop quality deposits hire and retain a skilled workforce and to manage our costs 

labor matters

environmental and reclamation matters 

the cost of complying with environmental laws is a fundamental and substantial cost of our business for information about environmental regulation litigation and related costs refer to item 1a “risk factors” item 3 “legal proceedings” and notes 1 and 13 

community and human rights 

we have adopted policies that govern our working relationships with the communities where we operate that are designed to guide our practices and programs in a manner that respects basic human rights and the culture of the local people impacted by our operations we continue to make significant expenditures on community development education training and cultural programs which include 

·   comprehensive job training programs 

·   basic education programs 

·   public health programs including malaria control 

·   agricultural assistance programs 

·   small and medium enterprise development programs 

·   cultural preservation programs 

·   water and sewage treatment projects 

·   clean water access 

·   charitable donations 

in december 2000 we endorsed the joint us state departmentbritish foreign office voluntary principles on human rights and security voluntary principles several major natural resources companies and international human rights organizations participated in developing the voluntary principles and have endorsed them we participated in developing these principles and they are incorporated into our human rights policy 

  

  

we believe that our social and economic development programs are responsive to the issues raised by the local communities near our areas of operation and should help us maintain good relations with the surrounding communities and avoid disruptions of mining operations nevertheless social and political instability in the areas of our operations may adversely impact our mining operations refer to item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

south america  cerro verde has provided a variety of community support projects over the years during 2006 as a result of discussions with local mayors in the arequipa region cerro verde agreed to contribute to the design and construction of domestic water and sewage treatment plants for the benefit of the region these facilities are being designed in a modular fashion so that initial installations can be readily expanded in the future refer to note 14 for further discussion 

also during 2006 the peruvian government announced that all mining companies operating in peru would be required to make annual contributions to local development funds for a 5year period covering the years 2006 through 2010 when copper prices exceed certain levels that are adjusted annually the contribution was equal to 375 percent of aftertax profits of which 275 percent was contributed to a local mining fund and 100 percent to a regional mining fund cerro verde’s contributions totaled 41 million in 2010 and 28 million in both 2009 and 2008 it is uncertain whether the contribution will be extended abandoned or replaced by a tax or different mechanism 

indonesia  in 1996 pt freeport indonesia established the freeport partnership fund for community development the partnership fund through which pt freeport indonesia has made available funding and technical assistance to support the economic health education and social development of the area pt freeport indonesia has committed through 2011 to provide one percent of its annual revenue for the development of the local people in its area of operation through the partnership fund our share of contributions to the partnership fund totaled 64 million in 2010 59 million in 2009 and 34 million in 2008 

the amungme and kamoro community development organization  lembaga pembangunan masyarakat amungme dan kamoro or lpmak oversees disbursement of the program funds we contribute to the partnership fund lpmak is governed by a board of commissioners and a board of directors which are comprised of representatives from the local amungme and kamoro tribal communities government leaders church leaders and one representative of pt freeport indonesia on each board the amungme and kamoro people are original inhabitants of the land in our area of operations 

security matters    consistent with our cow in indonesia and the requirement to protect our employees and property we have taken appropriate steps to provide a safe and secure working environment as part of its security program pt freeport indonesia maintains its own internal security department which is unarmed and performs functions such as protecting company facilities monitoring the shipment of company supplies and products assisting in traffic control and aiding in emergency response operations the security department has received human rights training and each member is required to certify his or her compliance with our human rights policy 

between july 2009 and january 2010 there were a series of shooting incidents along the road leading to our mining and milling operations at the grasberg mining complex in connection with these incidents there were three fatalities refer to item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion pt freeport indonesia’s share of costs for its internal civilian security department totaled 28 million for 2010 18 million for 2009 and 22 million for 2008 

pt freeport indonesia and all businesses and residents of indonesia rely on the government of indonesia for the maintenance of public order upholding the rule of law and the protection of personnel and property the grasberg minerals district has been designated by the government of indonesia as one of indonesia’s vital national assets this designation results in the police and to a lesser extent the military playing a significant role in protecting the area of our operations the government of indonesia is responsible for employing police and military personnel and directing their operations 

from the outset of pt freeport indonesia’s operations the government has looked to pt freeport indonesia to provide logistical and infrastructure support and assistance for these necessary services because of the limited resources of the indonesian government and the remote location of and lack of development in papua pt freeport indonesia’s financial support for the indonesian government security institutions assigned to the operations area represents a prudent response to its requirements to protect its workforce and property better 

  

  

  

ensuring that personnel are properly fed and lodged and have the logistical resources to patrol pt freeport indonesia’s roads and secure its operating area in addition the provision of such support is consistent with pt freeport indonesia’s obligations under the cow reflects our philosophy of responsible corporate citizenship and is in keeping with our commitment to pursue practices that will promote human rights 

pt freeport indonesia’s share of support costs for the governmentprovided security was 14 million for 2010 10 million for 2009 and 8 million for 2008 this supplemental support consists of various infrastructure and other costs such as food housing fuel travel vehicle repairs allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs and community assistance programs conducted by the military and police 

africa  tfm has committed to assist the communities living within its concession in the katanga province of the drc initiatives that have commenced over the past three years include a malaria control program construction and operational support for six elementary schools installation of over 40 clean water wells throughout the concession as well as five villages outside the concession a public sanitation latrines and hand washing program reaching over 2000 households a mobile clinic for rural villages and economic development programs supporting local entrepreneurs farmers and women’s income generation and literacy groups we have also made significant investments in infrastructure in the region that will have lasting benefits to the country including upgrading a national road and the regional power generation and transmission systems 

tfm has also committed to contribute 03 percent of net sales revenue from production to a community development fund to assist the local communities with development of local infrastructure and related services this fund will be a platform to work jointly with the local government and community to further assist them to fulfill their local development plans meet basic community needs and promote good governance community development fund contributions totaled approximately 3 million in 2010 and 1 million in 2009 

security matters  tfm also engages government security to assist with security matters at its concession area unarmed security personnel including administration and guard forces along with government security provide security for the mine site tfm provides food housing monetary allowances and logistical support as well as direct payments to the government for the provision of the security assigned to the concession area the total cost to tfm for this support including inkind support totaled less than 1 million for the years 2010 and 2009 

tfm also participates in monthly security coordination meetings with host country security personnel other mining companies and representatives from the united nations to discuss security issues and concerns 

 

  

ore reserves 

recoverable proven and probable reserves summarized below and detailed on the following pages have been calculated as of december 31 2010 in accordance with industry guide 7 as required by the securities exchange act of 1934 proven and probable reserves may not be comparable to similar information regarding mineral reserves disclosed in accordance with the guidance of other countries proven and probable reserves were determined by the use of mapping drilling sampling assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry as more fully discussed below the term “reserve” as used in the reserve data presented here means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination the term “proven reserves” means reserves for which 1 quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops trenches workings or drill holes 2 grade andor quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and 3 the sites for inspection sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established the term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced the degree of assurance although lower than that for proven reserves is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 

our reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies we conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk we revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies our estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves are prepared by and are the responsibility of our employees a majority of these estimates are reviewed and verified by independent experts in mining geology and reserve determination 

estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves at december 31 2010 were determined using longterm average prices of 200 per pound for copper 750 per ounce for gold 1000 per pound for molybdenum 1500 per ounce for silver and 1000 per pound for cobalt for the three year period ended december 31 2010 lme spot copper prices averaged 297 per pound london gold prices averaged 1023 per ounce and the weekly average price of molybdenum quoted by metals week averaged 1876 per pound the recoverable proven and probable reserves presented in the table below represent the estimated metal quantities from which we expect to be paid after application of estimated metallurgical recovery rates and smelter recovery rates where applicable recoverable reserves are the part of a mineral deposit that we estimate can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

 

  

in defining our openpit reserves we apply a “variable cutoff grade” strategy the objective of this strategy is to maximize the net present value of our operations we use a breakeven cutoff grade to define the insitu reserves for our underground ore bodies the breakeven cutoff grade is defined for a metric ton of ore as that equivalent copper grade once produced and sold that generates sufficient revenue to cover all operating and administrative costs associated with our production 

our copper mines may contain other commercially recoverable metals such as gold molybdenum silver and cobalt we value all commercially recoverable metals in terms of a copper equivalent percentage to determine a single cutoff grade copper equivalent percentage is used to express the relative value of multimetal ores in terms of one metal the calculation expresses the relative value of the ore using estimates of contained metal quantities metals prices as used for reserve determination recovery rates treatment charges and royalties our molybdenum properties use a molybdenum cutoff grade 

the table below shows the minimum cutoff grade by process for each of our existing ore bodies as of december 31 2010 

 

 

  

drill hole spacing data is used by mining professionals such as geologists and geological engineers in determining the suitability of data coverage on a relative basis in a given deposit type and mining method scenario so as to achieve a given level of confidence in the resource estimate drill hole spacing is only one of several criteria necessary to establish resource classification drilling programs are typically designed to achieve an optimum sample spacing to support the level of confidence in results that apply to a particular stage of development of a mineral deposit 

the following table sets forth the average drill hole spacing based on average sample distance or drill pattern spacing for proven and probable ore reserves by process type 

 

 

  

production sequencing 

the following chart illustrates our current plans for sequencing and producing our proven and probable reserves at each of our ore bodies and the years in which we currently expect production from each ore body the chart also shows the term of pt freeport indonesia’s cow production volumes are typically lower in the first few years for each ore body as development activities are ongoing and as the mine ramps up to full production and production volumes may also be lower as the mine reaches the end of its life the ultimate timing of the start of production from our undeveloped mines is dependent upon a number of factors including the results of our exploration and development efforts and may vary from the dates shown below in addition we develop our mine plans based on maximizing the net present value from the ore bodies significant additional capital expenditures will be required at many of these mines in order to achieve the lifeofmine plans reflected below 

 

mill and leach stockpiles 

mill and leach stockpiles generally contain lower grade ores that have been extracted from the ore body and are available for copper recovery for mill stockpiles recovery is through milling concentrating smelting and refining or alternatively by concentrate leaching for leach stockpiles recovery is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities 

because it is generally impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count reasonable estimation methods are employed the quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grades of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles 

expected copper recovery rates for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing the recoverable copper in mill stockpiles once entered into the production process can be produced into copper concentrate almost immediately 

  

  

expected copper recovery rates for leach stockpiles are determined using smallscale laboratory tests small to largescale column testing which simulates the productionscale process historical trends and other factors including mineralogy of the ore and rock type ultimate recovery of copper contained in leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low percentage to more than 90 percent depending on several variables including type of copper recovery mineralogy and particle size of the rock for newly placed material on active stockpiles as much as 70 percent of the copper ultimately recoverable may be extracted during the first year and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years 

processes and recovery rates are monitored continuously and recovery rate estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes during fourthquarter 2010 revised recovery rate estimates at el abra resulted in a reduction of 163 million pounds in leach stockpiles following are our stockpiles and the estimated recoverable copper contained within those stockpiles as of december 31 2010 

 

 

 

 

 

mineralized material 

we hold various properties containing mineralized material that we believe could be brought into production should market conditions warrant however permitting and significant capital expenditures would be required before operations could commence at these properties mineralized material is a mineralized body that has been delineated by appropriately spaced drilling andor underground sampling to support the reported tonnage and average metal grades such a deposit cannot qualify as recoverable proven and probable reserves until legal and economic feasibility are confirmed based upon a comprehensive evaluation of development costs unit costs grades recoveries and other material factors estimated mineralized materials as presented on the following page were assessed using prices of 220 per pound for copper 1000 per ounce for gold and 1200 per pound for molybdenum

financial risks 

extended declines in the market prices of copper gold andor molybdenum could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows and if sustained could adversely affect our ability to repay debt fluctuations in the market prices of copper gold or molybdenum can cause significant volatility in our financial performance and adversely affect the trading prices of our debt and equity securities 

our financial results are affected significantly by the market prices of copper and to a lesser extent gold and molybdenum for further information about movements in the market prices of these commodities refer to discussion below and item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” an extended decline in the market prices of these commodities could 1 adversely affect our financial results 2 adversely affect our ability to repay our debt and meet our other fixed obligations and 3 depress the trading prices of our common stock and of our publicly traded debt securities 

substantially all of our copper concentrate and cathode sales contracts provide final pricing in a specified future period generally one to four months from the shipment date based primarily on quoted london metal exchange lme monthly average spot prices accordingly in times of rising copper prices our revenues benefit from higher prices received for contracts priced at current market rates and also from an increase related to the final pricing of provisionally priced sales pursuant to contracts entered into in prior periods however in times of falling copper prices the opposite occurs 

there continues to be uncertainty in the global economy which could negatively affect the market prices of commodities including the metals that we produce if market prices for the metals we produce decline for a sustained period of time we may have to revise our operating plans including curtailing production reducing operating costs and capital expenditures and discontinuing certain exploration and development programs we may be unable to decrease our costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues and may incur losses 

copper prices have fluctuated historically with lme spot copper prices ranging from 126 to 442 per pound during the three years ended december 31 2010 the lme spot copper price closed at 450 per pound on february 11 2011 copper prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

gold prices have also fluctuated historically with london gold prices ranging from 713 to 1421 per ounce for the three years ended december 31 2010 london gold prices closed at 1364 per ounce on february 11 2011 gold prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

molybdenum prices also fluctuate with the metals week molybdenum dealer oxide weekly average price ranging from 783 to 3388 per pound for the three years ended december 31 2010 the metals week molybdenum dealer oxide weekly average price was 1758 per pound on february 11 2011 molybdenum prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under us federal and state laws that require closure and reclamation plans for our mines we generally are required to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement those plans if we are unable to do so the us environmental protection agency epa and state agencies may seek financial assurance for investigation and remediation actions under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or equivalent state regulations the failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

we generally are required by us federal and state laws to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans if we are unable to do so these laws are complex and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction the laws govern the determination of the scope and cost of the closure and reclamation obligations and the amount and forms of financial assurance 

 

epa and state agencies may seek financial assurance for investigation and remediation actions under cercla or equivalent state regulations in july 2009 epa published a priority notice of action identifying classes of facilities within the hardrock mining industry for which the agency will develop financial responsibility requirements 

  

  

  

concerning the degree and duration of risk associated with the production transportation treatment storage or disposal of hazardous substances it is uncertain how the new requirements if promulgated will affect the amount and form of our existing and future financial assurance obligations 

 

as of december 31 2010 our financial assurance obligations associated with closure and reclamation costs totaled approximately 793 million of which approximately 482 million was in the form of parent company guarantees and financial capability demonstrations our ability to continue to provide financial assurance in the form of parent guarantees and financial capability demonstrations depends on our ability to meet financial tests certain of the ratios in these tests are significantly more rigorous for companies that do not have an investment grade rating from a stateapproved ratings service we are currently rated investment grade by standard  poor’s rating services sp fitch ratings and moody’s investors service moody’s if we fail to maintain our investment grade rating we would be subject to these more rigorous tests in which case the regulatory agencies may require us to provide alternative forms of financial assurance such as letters of credit surety bonds or collateral depending on our financial condition and market conditions these other forms of financial assurance may be difficult or costly to provide issuance of letters of credit under our credit facilities would reduce our available liquidity failure to provide the required financial assurance could result in the closure of mines as of december 31 2010 we had limited financial assurance obligations associated with cerclarelated remediation obligations although epa and certain states are currently considering increasing the use of financial assurance requirements for such obligations   for additional information see the environmental risk factor “ mine closure regulations impose substantial costs on our operations ” below 

 

the agreements governing our indebtedness require us to meet certain financial tests and other covenants and as a result may limit our flexibility in the operation of our business and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 

at december 31 2010 the outstanding principal amount of our debt was 48 billion the agreements governing our indebtedness restrict subject to certain exceptions our ability to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the ratings on our senior notes are investment grade the restrictions contained in our 8375 and 825 senior notes on incurring debt making restricted payments and selling assets are currently suspended to the extent the rating is downgraded below investment grade by both sp and moody’s the covenants would again become effective our revolving credit facilities contain restrictions on the amount available for dividend 

  

  

  

payments purchases of our common stock and certain debt prepayments however these restrictions do not apply as long as availability under the revolvers plus domestic cash exceeds 750 million at december 31 2010 we had availability under the revolvers plus available domestic cash as defined by the revolving credit facilities of approximately 41 billion refer to note 9 for further discussion 

in addition our revolving credit facilities require that we meet certain financial tests at any time that borrowings are outstanding under these facilities including a leverage ratio test total debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the facility for the preceding four quarters cannot exceed 50 to 10 on the last day of any fiscal quarter and a secured leverage ratio test total secured debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the facility for the preceding four quarters cannot exceed 30 to 10 on the last day of any fiscal quarter during periods in which copper gold or molybdenum prices or production volumes or other conditions reflect the adverse impact of cyclical market trends or other factors we may not be able to comply with the applicable financial covenants 

our obligations under our revolving credit facilities are 1 guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries and 2 secured by a pledge of a 100 percent of the equity in substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries and b 665 percent of the equity in substantially all of our first tier foreign subsidiaries 

any failure to comply with the restrictions of our revolving credit facilities senior notes or any agreement governing our other indebtedness after giving effect to any applicable grace period may result in an event of default such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt which may trigger crossacceleration or crossdefault provisions in other debt agreements we would not be able to fully repay when due borrowings under our debt instruments that are accelerated upon an event of default 

if we are unable to repay refinance or restructure our indebtedness under or amend the covenants contained in our senior credit agreements at maturity or in the event of a default the lenders under our revolving credit facilities could terminate their commitments thereunder cease making further loans declare all borrowings outstanding together with accrued interest and other fees immediately due and payable and institute foreclosure proceedings against the collateral any such actions could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

movements in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively affect our operating results 

the functional currency for most of our operations is the us dollar all of our revenues and a significant portion of our costs are denominated in us dollars however some costs and certain asset and liability accounts are denominated in local currencies including the indonesian rupiah australian dollar chilean peso peruvian nuevo sol and euro generally our results are adversely affected when the us dollar weakens in relation to those foreign currencies refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a summary of the estimated impact of changes in foreign currency rates on our annual operating costs 

from time to time we may implement currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange however our hedging strategies may not be successful and any of our unhedged foreign exchange payments will continue to be subject to market fluctuations 

operational risks 

our business is subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our business 

mines by their nature are subject to many operational risks some of which are outside of our control these operational risks which could adversely affect our business operating results and cash flows include the following 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the failure to adequately manage some of these risks could result in significant personal injury loss of life property damage and damage to the environment both on and outside our operating sites as well as damage to production facilities and delays in production 

our mining production depends on the availability of sufficient water supplies 

our operations require significant quantities of water for mining ore processing and related support facilities our operations in north and south america are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant continuous production at our mines depends on our ability to maintain our water rights and claims at our north america operations under state law our water rights give us only the right to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location in arizona we are a participant in two active general stream adjudications in which for over 30 years the state of arizona has been attempting to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for two of the state’s largest river systems that affect four of our operating mines morenci sierrita miami and safford the legal precedent set in these proceedings may also affect our arizona mine at bagdad groundwater is not subject to adjudication in arizona but is subject to the doctrine of reasonable use however wells may be subject to adjudication to the extent they are found to produce or affect surface water in colorado our surface water and groundwater rights are subject to adjudication and we are involved in legal proceedings to resolve disputes regarding priority of administration of rights including priority of some of our rights for the climax mine our surface water and groundwater rights are fully licensed or have been fully adjudicated in new mexico 

water for our candelaria and ojos del salado mining operations is drawn from the copiapó river aquifer because of rapid depletion of this aquifer in recent years studies have been ongoing to assess available supply for these operations based on these studies we have begun to develop replacement supplies from renewable sources we recently completed construction of a pipeline to convey reclaimed water from a nearby waste water treatment facility to our candelaria mine we have also started engineering for the construction of a desalination plant near the pacific ocean to treat seawater and a pipeline to convey the water to candelaria the plant is expected to be completed by the end of 2012 

water for our el abra mining operations comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de 

  

  

  

ascotán in 2010 we obtained regulatory approval subject to certain conditions for the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascotán for the sulfolix processing plant which will begin operations in 2011 failure to meet the specified conditions could adversely affect the sulfolix processing plant a change to the sulfide ore project such as increased production or mill processing would require additional water beyond our sulfolix ground water pumping which is permitted through 2021 el abra is also conducting studies to assess the feasibility of constructing a desalination plant near the pacific ocean to treat seawater for possible increased sulfide ore production or mill processing 

water for our cerro verde mining operations comes from a series of storage reservoirs in the rio chili watershed that collect runoff from seasonal precipitation our cerro verde mining operations recently constructed new water reservoirs on the rio chili watershed to obtain additional water rights and to expand storage capacity in the watershed due to occasional drought and possibility that climate change will reduce precipitation levels temporary supply shortages are possible that could affect our operations as currently planned cerro verde is conducting water studies to assess opportunities for additional supplies to support current operations and potential future expansion projects 

although each operation has sufficient water rights and claims to cover current operational demands we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings on our water rights claims and uses the loss of some or all water rights for any of our mines in whole or in part or shortages of water to which we have rights could require us to curtail or close mining production and could prevent us from pursuing expansion opportunities 

increased production costs could reduce our profitability and cash flow 

energy represents approximately 20 percent of our production costs an inability to procure sufficient energy at reasonable prices could adversely affect our profits cash flow and growth opportunities our production costs are also affected by the prices of commodities we consume or use in our operations such as sulphuric acid grinding media steel reagents liners explosives and diluents the prices of such commodities are influenced by supply and demand trends affecting the mining industry in general and other factors outside our control and such prices are at times subject to volatile movements increases in the cost of these commodities could make our operations less profitable increases in the costs of commodities that we consume or use may also significantly affect the capital costs of new projects 

in addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry our indonesia operations involve additional risks because they are located on unusually difficult terrain in a very remote area 

our grasberg mining operations are located in steep mountainous terrain in a very remote area in indonesia because of these conditions we have had to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities in addition the area receives considerable rainfall which has led to periodic floods and mudslides the mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time our insurance may not sufficiently cover an unexpected natural or operating disaster 

in october 2003 a slippage of material occurred in a section of the grasberg open pit resulting in eight fatalities in december 2003 a debris flow involving a relatively small amount of loose material occurred in the same section of the open pit resulting in only minor property damage the events caused us to alter our shortterm mine sequencing plans which adversely affected our 2003 and 2004 production we resumed normal production activities in secondquarter 2004 

in march 2006 a mudtopsoil slide involving approximately 75000 metric tons of material occurred from a mountain ridge above service facilities supporting pt freeport indonesia’s mining facilities three contract workers were fatally injured in the event the material damaged a mess hall and an adjacent area as a result of investigations by pt freeport indonesia and the indonesian department of energy and mineral resources we conducted geotechnical studies to identify and address any potential hazards to workers and facilities from slides the existing early warning system for potential slides based upon rainfall and other factors has also been expanded 

in september 2008 a small scale failure encompassing approximately 75000 metric tons of material occurred at our grasberg open pit there were no injuries or property damage the event caused a delay in our access to the highgrade section of the open pit and as a result a portion of the metal expected to be mined in the second half 

  

  

  

of 2008 was deferred to future periods 

no assurance can be given that similar events will not occur in the future 

our africa mining operation tenke fungurume involves additional risks because it is located in a remote area of the democratic republic of congo drc 

our tenke fungurume mining operation is located in a remote area of the drc and is subject to additional challenges including 

 

 

 

 

 

for example due to limited rail access we currently truck a significant portion of the production from our tenke fungurume mining operation approximately 1900 miles to ports in south africa the tenke fungurume mining operation and future development may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control which could adversely affect their contribution to our operating results and increase the cost of future development 

an interruption of energy supply could adversely affect our mining operations 

our mining operations and development projects require significant energy principally electricity diesel coal and natural gas our south america mining operations receive electrical power under longterm contracts with local energy companies our africa mining operation has entered into longterm power supply and infrastructure funding agreements with the stateowned electric utility company serving the katanga province of the drc a disruption in the transmission of energy inadequate energy transmission infrastructure or the termination of any of our energy supply contracts could interrupt our energy supply and adversely affect our operations 

the volume and grade of ore reserves that we recover and our rate of production may be more or less than anticipated 

our ore reserve amounts are determined in accordance with established mining industry practices and standards and are estimates of the mineral deposits that can be recovered economically and legally based on currently available data estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves are subject to considerable uncertainty ore bodies may not conform to standard geological expectations and estimates may change as new data becomes available because ore bodies do not contain uniform grades and types of minerals our metal recovery rates will vary from time to time 

additionally because the determination of reserves is based partially on estimates of future selling prices a sustained decrease in such prices may result in a reduction in economically recoverable ore reserves these factors may result in variations in the volumes of mineral reserves that we report from period to period 

there are also uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of ore reserves and copper recovered from stockpiles the quantity of copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records the volume and grade of ore reserves recovered rates of production and recovered copper from stockpiles may be less than anticipated during fourthquarter 2010 revised recovery rate estimates at el abra resulted in a reduction of 163 million pounds in leach stockpiles 

  

  

we must continually replace reserves depleted by production our exploration activities may not result in additional discoveries 

our ability to replenish our ore reserves is important to our longterm viability produced ore reserves must be replaced by further delineation of existing ore bodies or by locating new deposits in order to maintain production levels over the long term exploration is highly speculative in nature our exploration projects involve many risks require substantial expenditures and may not result in the discovery of sufficient additional mineral deposits that can be mined profitably once a site with mineralization is discovered it may take several years from the initial phases of drilling until production is possible during which time the economic feasibility of production may change substantial expenditures are required to establish recoverable proven and probable reserves and to construct mining and processing facilities as a result there is no assurance that current or future exploration programs will be successful there is a risk that depletion of reserves will not be offset by discoveries or acquisitions 

development projects are inherently risky and may require more capital than anticipated which could adversely affect our business 

there are many risks and uncertainties inherent in all development projects including the development of underground mines in the grasberg minerals district and our development of a large sulfide deposit at our el abra mine the economic feasibility of development projects is based on many factors including the accuracy of estimated reserves metallurgical recoveries capital and operating costs and future prices of the relevant minerals the capital expenditures and time required to develop new mines or other projects are considerable and changes in costs or construction schedules can affect project economics moreover underground mining is generally more expensive than surface mining as a result of higher capital costs including costs for modern mining equipment and construction of extensive ventilation systems thus it is possible that actual costs and economic returns may differ materially from our estimates 

new development projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future cash flow these development projects also require the successful completion of feasibility studies acquisition of governmental permits acquisition of land power and water and ensuring that appropriate community infrastructure is developed by third parties to support such projects it is possible that we could fail to obtain the government approvals necessary for the operation of a project in which case the project may not proceed either on its original timing or at all it is not unusual for new mining operations to experience unexpected problems during the startup phase resulting in delays in producing revenue and increases in capital expenditures 

the development of underground mines is subject to additional risks including the following 

 

 

 

 

some of these risks could result in a delay to production start up and a loss or reduction in minable tons there can be no assurance that the occurrence of such events or conditions would not have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

environmental risks 

our domestic and international operations are subject to complex and evolving environmental laws and regulations and compliance with environmental and regulatory requirements involves significant costs 

our ongoing mining operations and exploration activities both in the us and elsewhere are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing exploration development production occupational health mine safety toxic 

  

  

  

substances waste disposal protection and remediation of the environment protection of endangered and protected species and other related matters compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs and we expect these costs to continue to increase in the future because of increased regulatory enforcement increased demand for remediation services and shortages of equipment supplies labor and other factors the federal clean air act has had a significant impact particularly on our domestic smelter and power plants any change in waste management regulation of the mining industry under the federal resource conservation and recovery act could have a significant impact both on operational compliance and closure costs in addition environmental laws and regulations may change in ways that could substantially increase compliance costs or adversely affect our operations or expansion opportunities 

in addition to compliance with environmental regulation at our operating sites we incur significant costs for remediating environmental conditions on properties that have not been operated in many years 

freeportmcmoran corporation fmc formerly phelps dodge and many of its affiliates and predecessor companies have been involved in mining milling and manufacturing in the us for more than a century activities that occurred in the late 19th century and the 20th century prior to the advent of modern environmental laws were not subject to environmental regulation and were conducted before american industrial companies understood the longterm effects of their operations on the surrounding environment with the passage of cercla in 1980 companies like fmc became legally responsible for environmental remediation on properties previously owned or operated by them irrespective of when the damage to the environment occurred or who caused it that liability is often shared on a joint and several basis with all other owners and operators meaning that each owner or operator of the property is fully responsible for the cleanup although in many cases some or all of the other historical owners or operators no longer exist do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found as a result because of our acquisition of fmc in 2007 many of the subsidiary companies we now own are responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the us and we expect to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address these remediation issues we are also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources at december 31 2010 we had more than 100 active remediation projects in the us in 27 states 

we incurred aggregate environmental capital expenditure and other environmental costs including our joint venture partners’ shares to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations of 372 million in 2010 289 million in 2009 and 377 million in 2008 the increase in environmental capital spending for 2010 compared with 2009 primarily related to settlement of legal proceedings refer to note 13 for further discussion for 2011 we expect to incur approximately 460 million of aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs which are part of our overall 2011 operating budget and primarily relates to ongoing environmental compliance 

at december 31 2010 14 billion of environmental obligations were recorded in our consolidated balance sheet our environmental obligation estimates are based upon 1 our knowledge and beliefs about complex scientific and historical facts and circumstances that in many cases involve events that occurred many decades ago 2 our beliefs and assumptions regarding the nature extent and duration of remediation activities that we will be required to undertake the estimated costs of those activities which are subject to varying interpretations and 3 our beliefs regarding the requirements that are imposed on us by existing laws and regulations and in some cases the expected clarification of uncertain regulatory requirements that could materially affect our environmental obligation estimates significant adjustments to these estimates are likely to occur in the future as additional information becomes available the actual environmental costs ultimately may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs and any such changes could be material refer to note 13 for more information on our environmental obligations 

an adverse ruling in one or more pending legal proceedings involving environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on us 

as described in note 13 and item 3 “legal proceedings” we are a defendant in numerous and in some cases significant litigation involving environmental cleanup costs alleged environmental toxic torts and interpretations of environmental regulations an adverse ruling in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

  

 

mine closure regulations impose substantial costs on our operations 

our domestic operations are subject to various federal and state permitting requirements that include mine closure and minedland reclamation obligations these requirements are complex and vary depending upon the jurisdiction the laws govern the determination of the scope and cost of the closure and reclamation obligations and the amount and forms of financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to meet the obligations of those plans if we are unable to do so in general our domestic mines are required to review estimated closure and reclamation costs on either a periodic basis or at the time of significant permit modifications and post increasing amounts of financial assurance as required it is uncertain how potential epa requirements for financial assurance will affect the timing of periodic closure cost reviews or the scope of closure activities 

 

in addition our international mines are subject to various mine closure and minedland reclamation laws and there have recently been significant changes in closure and reclamation programs in both peru and chile that impose more stringent obligations on us for closure and reclamation 

 

at december 31 2010 our asset retirement obligations aros determined as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the us totaled 856 million including 405 million for our new mexico operations 214 million for our arizona operations and 129 million for pt freeport indonesia aro cost estimates may increase or decrease significantly in the future as a result of changes in closure or financial assurance regulations engineering designs and technology permit modifications or updates mine plans cost of inflation or other factors and as actual reclamation spending occurs 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change issues may increase our costs and adversely affect our operations and markets 

many scientists believe that emissions from the combustion of carbonbased fuels contribute to greenhouse effects and therefore potentially to climate change in 2010 our worldwide total greenhouse gas emissions measured as carbon dioxide equivalent emissions were approximately 10 million metric tons divided between direct 56 percent and indirect 44 percent emissions most of our direct emissions are from fuel combustion in haul trucks followed by the combustion of fuels to provide energy for roasting smelting and other processes indirect emissions are generally the emissions of outside providers from whom we purchase electricity for use in our operations approximately 64 percent of our direct emissions are in indonesia 21 percent in north america and 10 percent in south america approximately 56 percent of our indirect emissions are in north america and 42 percent in south america 

a number of governments have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes regarding greenhouse gas emissions although several of these regulatory changes are being challenged at both the federal and state levels for example in the us the epa issued final regulations in september 2009 requiring mandatory monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions in specified circumstances commencing in 2010 our miami smelter and el paso refinery are required to report their emissions under this program in june 2010 the epa issued final regulations under the clean air act for the control of greenhouse gases from new large stationary sources of greenhouse gases and major modifications to large stationary sources of greenhouse gases the miami smelter is our only operation directly affected by these regulations however these regulations in conjunction with upcoming epa regulations for large fossil fuel fired power plants may result in increased energy costs at our operations several states have also initiated action on their own or as part of regional organizations such as the western climate initiative to limit emissions of greenhouse gases new mexico has promulgated regulations to control greenhouse gas emissions from large sources and to join the western climate initiative these actions will likely impact our new mexico operations through increased energy costs the us may also become a party to international agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions which could lead to new regulations affecting our us operations the december 1997 kyoto protocol established a set of greenhouse gas emission targets for developed countries that have ratified the protocol although the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 has not been ratified by the us the us continues to participate in global climate summits that may lead to an agreement in the future 

since 2006 we have participated in the carbon disclosure project which is a voluntary initiative that promotes standardized reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and reduction efforts in 2009 we formed a multidepartmental greenhouse gas task force under the direction of this task force we actively pursue ways to improve the energy efficiency of our operations and reduce greenhouse gas emissions including evaluating 

  

  

  

potential reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from our haul trucks however as a result of possible increases in production rates and longer and steeper haul profiles for the next several years we also expect increases in our total greenhouse gas emissions 

from a medium and longterm perspective we are likely to see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit significant amounts of greenhouse gases as a result of regulatory initiatives in the us and other countries in which we operate in addition the cost of electricity that we purchase from others may increase if they incur increased costs from the regulation of their greenhouse gas emissions we cannot predict the magnitude of any increased costs at this time given the wide scope of potential regulatory changes in the many countries in which we operate 

the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would be particular to the geographic circumstances these may include changes in rainfall patterns water shortages changing sea levels changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperatures these effects may adversely impact the cost production and financial performance of our operations 

our operating inactive and historical us mining sites and facilities may be subject to future regulation of radioactive materials that are commonly associated with or result from our mining operations 

a number of federal and state agencies are considering new regulations to characterize regulate and remediate potential workplace exposures and environmental impacts of radioactive materials commonly associated with mining operations for example the epa could promulgate rules to regulate technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive materials tenorm and their impacts at mining operations in addition several states are promulgating groundwater quality compliance and remediation standards for radioactive materials including uranium radioactive materials can be associated with copper mineral deposits including both our current and discontinued operations consequently our copper operations may generate concentrate or release radioactive materials that may subject our operations to new and increased regulation the impact of such future regulation on our operating closure reclamation and remediation costs is uncertain 

our indonesia mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges and future changes in environmental laws or unanticipated environmental impacts from those operations could require us to incur increased costs 

mining operations on the scale of our operations in papua involve significant environmental risks and challenges our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of crushed and ground rock material called tailings that results from the process by which we physically separate the copper gold and silverbearing materials from the ore that we mine our tailings management plan which has been approved by the government of indonesia uses the river system near our mine to transport the tailings to an engineered area in the lowlands where the tailings and natural sediments are managed in a deposition area lateral levees have been engineered and constructed to limit and help contain the footprint of tailings impact in the lowlands 

another major environmental challenge is managing overburden which is the rock that must be moved aside in the mining process in order to reach the ore in the presence of air water and naturally occurring bacteria some overburden can generate acid rock drainage or acidic water containing dissolved metals which if not properly managed can have a negative impact on the environment 

certain indonesian governmental officials have from time to time raised questions with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans including a suggestion that we implement a pipeline system rather than our river transport system for tailings management and disposition because our mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area a pipeline system would be costly difficult to construct and maintain and more prone to catastrophic failure and could therefore involve significant potentially adverse environmental issues based on our own studies and others conducted by third parties we do not believe that a pipeline system is necessary or practical 

in connection with obtaining our environmental approvals from the indonesian government we committed to perform a onetime environmental risk assessment on the impacts of our tailings management plan we completed this extensive environmental risk assessment with more than 90 scientific studies conducted over four years and submitted it to the indonesian government in december 2002 we developed the risk assessment study using internationally recognized methods with input from an independent review panel which included 

  

  

  

representatives from the indonesian government academia and nongovernmental organizations the risks identified during this process were in line with our impact projections of the tailings management program contained in our environmental approval documents 

since 2005 pt freeport indonesia has participated in the government of indonesia’s proper program for pollution control evaluation and rating program in november 2010 the indonesian ministry of environment announced the latest results of its proper environmental management audit and gave pt freeport indonesia a blue rating acknowledging pt freeport indonesia’s environmental management practices as being in compliance with the laws and regulations in indonesia and also making several recommendations for improvement 

international risks 

our international operations are subject to political social and geographic risks of doing business in foreign countries 

we are a global mining company with substantial assets located outside of the us we conduct international mining operations in indonesia peru chile and the drc accordingly our business may be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties in each of these countries in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in foreign countries such risks include 1 renegotiation cancellation or forced modification of existing contracts 2 expropriation or nationalization of property 3 changes in a foreign country’s laws regulations and policies including those relating to labor taxation royalties divestment imports exports trade regulations currency and environmental matters 4 political instability bribery extortion corruption civil strife acts of war guerilla activities insurrection and terrorism 5 foreign exchange controls and 6 the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel or having to enforce the judgment of a foreign court or arbitration panel against a sovereign nation within its own territory our insurance does not cover most losses caused by these risks consequently our exploration development and production activities outside of the us could be substantially affected by factors beyond our control some of which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 

in october 2010 pt freeport indonesia received from the indonesian tax authorities an assessment for additional taxes approximating 106 million and interest approximating 52 million related to various audit exceptions for 2005 pt freeport indonesia has filed objections to these assessments because it believes that it has properly paid taxes for the year 2005 and is working with the indonesian tax authorities to resolve this matter 

in december 2009 pt freeport indonesia was notified by the large taxpayer’s office of the government of indonesia that pt freeport indonesia is obligated to pay value added taxes on certain goods imported after the year 2000 the amount of taxes and penalties would be significant pt freeport indonesia believes that pursuant to the terms of its contract of work it is only required to pay value added taxes on these types of goods imported after december 30 2009 pt freeport indonesia has not received an assessment and is working with the applicable government authorities to resolve this matter 

in december 2008 cerro verde was notified by sunat the peruvian national tax authority of its intent to assess mining royalties related to the minerals processed by the cerro verde concentrator which was added to cerro verde’s processing facilities in late 2006 in august 2009 cerro verde received an assessment approximating 34 million in connection with its alleged obligations for mining royalties and penalties for the period from october 2006 to december 2007 in april 2010 sunat issued a ruling denying cerro verde’s protest of the assessment and in may 2010 cerro verde appealed this decision to the tax court cerro verde has also received an assessment approximating 41 million in mining royalties and penalties for the year 2008 in february 2011 sunat issued a ruling denying cerro verde’s protest of the assessment for the year 2008 and cerro verde is in the process of appealing this decision to the tax court cerro verde has also received a request for information for mining royalties covering the year 2009 sunat may continue to assess mining royalties annually until this matter is resolved by the tax court cerro verde is challenging these royalties because its stability agreement with the peruvian government exempts from royalties all minerals extracted from its mining concession irrespective of the method used for processing those minerals if cerro verde is ultimately found responsible for these royalties it will also be liable for interest which accrues at rates that range from 7 to 18 percent based on the year accrued and the currency in which the amounts would be payable as of december 31 2010 the aggregate amount of the october 2006 to december 2007 assessment with interest approximated 57 million and the aggregate amount of the 2008 assessment with interest approximated 61 million these amounts will continue to increase at varying interest rates 

  

  

because our grasberg minerals district in papua indonesia remains our most significant operating asset our business may continue to be adversely affected by indonesian political economic and social uncertainties 

indonesia has faced political economic and social uncertainties including separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces in particular several separatist groups are opposing indonesian rule over the province of papua where our grasberg minerals district is located and have sought political independence for the province in response indonesia enacted regional autonomy laws which became effective january 1 2001 the manner in which the new laws are being implemented and the degree of political and economic autonomy that they may bring to individual provinces including papua are uncertain and are ongoing issues in indonesian politics in papua there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the indonesian military social economic and political instability in papua could materially and adversely affect us if it results in damage to our property or interruption of our activities 

maintaining a good working relationship with the indonesian government is important to us because our mining operations there are among indonesia’s most significant business enterprises and are conducted pursuant to a contract of work with the indonesian government partially because of their significance to indonesia’s economy the environmentally sensitive area in which they are located and the number of people employed our operations are occasionally the subject of criticism in the indonesian press and in political debates and have been the target of protests and occasional violence 

between july 2009 and january 2010 there were a series of shooting incidents along the road leading to our mining and milling operations at our grasberg mining complex in connection with these incidents there were three fatalities including one pt freeport indonesia employee a security contractor and an indonesian policeman and several injuries the indonesian government responded with additional security forces and expressed a strong commitment to protect the safety of the community and of our operations 

pt freeport indonesia operated at reduced mining and milling rates during a fourday period in april 2007 as a result of peaceful protests by certain workers regarding benefits the protests ended with an agreement on a framework for minimum wages for workers and pt freeport indonesia returned to normal operations the impacts to production were not significant 

illegal miners have continued to operate along the river designated to transport the tailings from the mill to the lowlands in pt freeport indonesia’s governmentapproved tailings management area the illegal miners who have trespassed from time to time in the area of our facilities have clashed with police who have attempted to move them away from our facilities in 2006 the illegal miners temporarily blocked the road leading to the grasberg mine and mill in protest and pt freeport indonesia temporarily suspended mining and milling operations as a precautionary measure 

we cannot predict whether additional incidents will occur that could disrupt our indonesian operations or whether similar incidents may occur in other countries that could affect our other operations if additional protests or other disruptive incidents occur at any of our facilities they could adversely affect our business and profitability in ways that we cannot predict at this time 

we do not expect to mine all of our indonesian ore reserves before the initial term of our contract of work in indonesia expires 

all of our indonesian proven and probable ore reserves including the grasberg deposit are located in block a and the initial term of our contract of work covering these ore reserves expires at the end of 2021 we can extend this term for two successive 10year periods subject to the approval of the indonesian government which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably our ore reserves reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041 ie through the expiration of the two 10year extensions and our current mine plan has been developed and our operations are based on the assumption that we will receive the two 10year extensions as a result we will not mine all of these ore reserves during the current term of our contract of work and there can be no assurance that the indonesian government will approve the extensions prior to the end of 2021 we expect to mine 32 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable ore at december 31 2010 representing 38 percent of pt freeport indonesia’s share of recoverable copper reserves and 51 percent of its share of 

  

  

  

recoverable gold reserves 

in 2008 indonesia enacted a new mining law which will operate under a licensing system as opposed to the contract of work system that applies to pt freeport indonesia in 2010 the government of indonesia promulgated regulations under the 2008 mining law and certain provisions address existing contracts of work the regulations provide that contracts of work will continue to be honored until their expiration however the regulations attempt to apply certain provisions of the new law to any extension periods of contracts of work even though our contract of work provides for two 10year extension periods under the existing terms of the contract of work 

our contracts of work in indonesia are subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations and if a dispute arises we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel 

pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work and other contracts of work in which we have an interest were entered into under indonesia’s 1967 foreign capital investment law which provides guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization our contracts of work can be terminated by the government of indonesia if we do not satisfy our contractual obligations which include the payment of royalties and taxes to the government and the satisfaction of certain mining environmental safety and health requirements 

certain forestry laws and designations as well as prevailing environmental laws and regulations may conflict with or overlap with the mining rights established under our contract of work although our contract of work grants to pt freeport indonesia the unencumbered right to operate in accordance with the contract of work certain government agencies could seek to impose additional restrictions on pt freeport indonesia that could affect exploration and operating requirements 

at times certain government officials and others in indonesia have questioned the validity of contracts entered into by the government of indonesia prior to may 1998 ie during the suharto regime which lasted over 30 years including pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work which was signed in december 1991 we cannot provide assurance that the validity of or our compliance with the contracts of work will not be challenged for political or other reasons pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work and our other contracts of work require that disputes with the indonesian government be submitted to international arbitration consequently if a dispute arises under the contracts of work we face the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel and if we prevail in such a dispute we will face the additional risk of having to enforce the judgment of a foreign court or arbitration panel against indonesia within its own territory 

indonesian government officials have periodically undertaken reviews regarding our compliance with indonesian environmental laws and regulations and the terms of the contracts of work in 2006 the government of indonesia created a joint team for “periodic evaluation on implementation of the ptfi contract of work” to conduct an evaluation every five years the team consists of five working groups whose members are from relevant ministries or agencies covering production state revenues community development environmental issues and security issues we have conducted numerous meetings with these groups the joint team has indicated that it will issue a report while we believe that we comply with pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work in all material respects we cannot provide assurance that the report will support that conclusion separately the indonesian house of representatives created a working committee on pt freeport indonesia members of this group have also visited our operations and held a number of hearings in jakarta we will continue to work with these groups to respond to their questions about our operations and our compliance with pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work 

any suspension of required activities under our contracts of work requires the consent of the indonesian government 

our contracts of work permit us to suspend certain contractually required activities including exploration for a period of one year by making a written request to the indonesian government these requests are subject to the approval of the indonesian government and are renewable annually if we do not request a suspension or are denied a suspension then we are required to continue our activities under the contract of work or potentially be declared in default moreover if a suspension continues for more than one year for reasons other than force majeure and the indonesian government has not approved such continuation then the government would be entitled to declare a default under the contract of work 

  

  

we suspended our field exploration activities outside of block a in recent years because of safety and security issues and regulatory uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest areas and an indonesian forestry law enacted in 1999 prohibiting openpit mining in forest preservation areas in 2001 we requested and received from the government of indonesia formal temporary suspensions of our obligations under the contracts of work in all areas outside of block a recent indonesian legislation permits openpit mining in pt freeport indonesia’s block b area subject to certain requirements following an assessment of these requirements and a review of security issues in 2007 we resumed exploration activities in certain prospective contract of work areas outside of block a 

our tenke fungurume mining operation is located in the katanga province of the drc and may be adversely affected by political economic and social instability in the drc 

 

during 2009 we completed construction activities for the initial tenke fungurume development project which is located in the drc since gaining independence in 1960 the drc has undergone outbreaks of violence changes in national leadership and financial crisis these factors heighten the risk of abrupt changes in the national policy toward foreign investors which in turn could result in unilateral modification of concessions or contracts increased taxation denial of permits or permit renewals or expropriation of assets as part of a review of all mining contracts by the ministry of mines ministry in the drc in february 2008 we received notification that the ministry wished to renegotiate several material provisions of tenke fungurume mining sarl’s tfm mining concessions in october 2010 the government of the drc announced the conclusion of the review of tfm’s mining contracts the conclusion of the review process confirmed that tfm’s existing mining contracts are in good standing and acknowledged the rights and benefits granted under those contracts in connection with the review tfm made several commitments that have been reflected in amendments to its mining contracts refer to note 14 for further discussion in december 2010 the addenda to tfm’s amended and restated mining convention and amended and restated shareholders’ agreement were signed by the parties and are pending a presidential decree tfm’s existing mining contracts will be in effect until a presidential decree is obtained after giving effect to the amendments and obtaining approval of the modification to tfm’s bylaws our effective ownership interest in the project will be 560 percent compared to our current ownership interest of 5775 percent 

in july 2009 tfm was advised that the minister of justice in the drc authorized an inquiry regarding the alleged misappropriation of public funds in connection with the securing of labor and immigration authorizations and the payment of associated fees for the tenke fungurume project several government officials and three tfm employees were arrested in october 2009 the three tfm employees were tried and acquitted one government official the head of immigration in the katanga province was sentenced to five years imprisonment on charges of embezzlement the office of the attorney general of the drc filed a notice of appeal of the judgment and the matter is pending at the appellate court 

in july 2009 tfm entered into a settlement agreement with drc tax authorities in connection with an administrative audit regarding the payment of fees for work permits and visas for its foreign workers and subcontractors including shortterm workers pursuant to the agreement which covers the period from january 2007 to the date of the settlement tfm paid approximately 16 million in fees and penalties the procedures associated with obtaining labor and immigration authorizations for shortterm workers on a timely basis are not clearly established in the drc and tfm continues to work proactively and cooperatively with the government authorities to establish approved procedures for doing so consistent with its mining convention and local law in connection with this matter we notified the us government enforcement authorities about our internal investigation of the immigration work permit and visa matter and the associated criminal case we have received and responded to requests from us government authorities related to the matter and to other requests for information about our compliance program 

other political economic and social risks that are generally outside of our control and could adversely affect our business include 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequently our tenke fungurume mining operations and future development projects may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control any of which could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 

terrorist attacks and violence near our operations and throughout the world and the potential for additional future terrorist acts and violence have created economic and political uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business 

in july 2009 two suicide bombers set off explosions inside of the jw marriott and ritzcarlton hotels in jakarta indonesia that are reported to have killed nine people and injured 53 others two of our indonesianbased executives were injured in the incident 

in july 2009 a small group of individuals created a disturbance on the road leading to our mining and milling operations at our grasberg mining complex and vandalized vehicles and small buildings there were no injuries for more information about a series of shooting incidents near our grasberg mining complex see the risk factor “because our grasberg minerals district in papua indonesia remains our most significant operating asset our business may continue to be adversely affected by indonesian political economic and social uncertainties” above 

in august 2002 three people were killed and 11 others were wounded in an ambush by a group of unidentified assailants on the road near tembagapura the mining town where the majority of pt freeport indonesia’s personnel reside the assailants shot at several vehicles transporting international contract teachers from our school in tembagapura their family members and other contractors to pt freeport indonesia the us federal bureau of investigation fbi investigated the incident which resulted in the us indictment of an alleged operational commander of the free papua movementnational freedom force in january 2006 indonesian police accompanied by fbi agents arrested the alleged operational commander and 11 other papuans in november 2006 verdicts and sentencing were announced for seven of those accused in the august 2002 shooting including a life sentence for the confessed leader of the attack 

in october 2002 a bombing killed 202 people in the indonesian province of bali which is 1500 miles west of our mining and milling operations indonesian authorities arrested 35 people in connection with this bombing and 29 of those arrested have been tried and convicted in august 2003 12 people were killed and over 100 were injured by a car bomb detonated outside of the jw marriott hotel in jakarta indonesia in september 2004 11 people were killed and over 200 injured by a car bomb detonated in front of the australian embassy in jakarta in october 2005 three suicide bombers killed 19 people and wounded over 100 in bali the same international terrorist organizations are suspected in each of these incidents in november 2005 indonesian police raided a house in east java that resulted in the death of other accused terrorists linked to the bombings discussed above our mining and milling operations were not interrupted by these incidents but pt freeport indonesia’s corporate office in jakarta had to relocate for several months following the bombing in front of the australian embassy in addition to the bali jw marriott hotel and australian embassy bombings there have been antiamerican demonstrations in certain sections of indonesia reportedly led by radical islamic activists 

no assurance can be given that additional terrorist incidents and acts of violence will not occur if there were to be additional violence it could materially and adversely affect our business in ways that we cannot predict at this time 

  

  

other risks 

if market prices for our commodities decline the carrying values of inventories and longlived assets may be further impaired which could require charges to operating income that could be material 

during fourthquarter 2008 we concluded that the thencurrent economic environment and significant declines in copper and molybdenum prices represented significant adverse changes in our business requiring us to evaluate our longlived assets and goodwill for impairment as a result we recorded impairment charges totaling 169 billion 126 billion to net loss attributable to common stockholders refer to note 17 for further discussion 

the declines in copper and molybdenum prices in late 2008 also resulted in lower of cost or market lcm inventory charges totaling 782 million 479 million to net loss attributable to common stockholders in 2008 additional lcm charges associated with molybdenum inventories totaling 19 million 15 million to net income attributable to common stockholders were recorded in firstquarter 2009 we recorded no further lcm inventory adjustments subsequent to firstquarter 2009 

declines in the market price of copper among other factors could cause us to record additional lcm inventory adjustments and could also result in an additional write down of the carrying value of longlived assets which would potentially have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and stockholders equity but would have no effect on cash flows 

unanticipated litigation or negative developments in pending litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are a party to the litigation described in note 13 and in item 3 “legal proceedings” and a number of other litigation matters including asbestos exposure cases disputes over the allocation of environmental remediation obligations at superfund and other sites disputes over water rights and disputes with regulatory authorities the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant monetary damages penalties or injunctive relief against us limitations on our property rights or regulatory interpretations that increase our operating costs if any of these disputes results in a substantial monetary judgment against us or an adverse legal interpretation is settled on unfavorable terms or otherwise affects our operations it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we depend on our senior management team and other key employees and the loss of any of these employees could adversely affect our business 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract retain and motivate senior management and other key employees achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions competitors’ hiring practices cost reduction activities and the effectiveness of our compensation programs competition for qualified personnel can be very intense we must continue to recruit retain and motivate senior management and other key employees sufficient to maintain our current business and support our future projects a loss of such personnel could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and our operating results could be adversely affected 

our holding company structure may impact your ability to receive dividends  

we are a holding company with no material assets other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries as a result our ability to repay our indebtedness and pay dividends is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend loan debt repayment or otherwise our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to make funds available to us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends dividends from subsidiaries that are not wholly owned are shared with other equity owners in addition cash at our international operations is subject to foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation into the us 

in addition our subsidiaries may not be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries’ assets upon their liquidation reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries’ creditors including any trade creditors 

  

  

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult these provisions 

 

 

 

 

 

these provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our board of directors 

in addition because we are incorporated in delaware we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with or acquisition of us 

these provisions may deter an acquisition of us that might otherwise be attractive to stockholders

environmental proceedings 

newtown creek  from the 1930s until 1964 phelps dodge refining corporation pdrc a subsidiary of freeportmcmoran corporation operated a smelter and from the 1930’s until 1984 it operated a refinery on the banks of newtown creek which is a 35 milelong waterway that forms part of the boundary between brooklyn and queens in new york city heavy industrialization along the banks of newtown creek and discharges from the city of new york’s sewer system over more than a century resulted in significant environmental contamination of the waterway the new york attorney general previously notified several companies including pdrc about possible obligations to clean up sediments in newtown creek in march and april 2010 the us environmental protection agency epa notified pdrc and five others that epa considers them to be potentially responsible parties under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the notified parties began working with epa to identify other potentially responsible parties and epa proposed that the notified parties perform a remedial investigationfeasibility study rifs at their expense and reimburse epa for its oversight costs epa is not expected to propose a remedy until after an rifs is completed which is expected to take several years on september 29 2010 epa designated newtown creek as a superfund site the cost of remediating newtown creek could be significant and depending on what portion of that cost is allocated to pdrc that share could be material to us 

gilt   edge mine site    on july 12 2010 we were notified by the us department of justice acting at the request of epa that the us was preparing to file suit in federal court against two of our wholly owned subsidiaries cyprus mines corporation and cyprus amax minerals company inc and several other parties to recover costs incurred or to be incurred by the us in responding to the release or threatened release of hazardous substances at the gilt edge mine site in lawrence county south dakota the letter stated that the us would assert that the cyprus entities are jointly and severally liable with the other parties for all response costs incurred by the us at this site under cercla the letter asserted that the us had incurred approximately 91 million in response costs and expected to incur significant additional response costs in the future we do not know whether the other parties could contribute materially to reimbursement of these response costs 

we have conducted a detailed investigation of this site and have concluded that the cyprus entities were engaged only in exploration at the site and were not involved in the largescale mining operation that left the site in its current condition we believe there is a reasonable basis for apportioning the response costs based on historical records of activities at the site so that the liability of the cyprus entities should be proportional to the actual harm done rather than joint and several as the government asserts we are engaged in discussions with the us and we intend to vigorously defend this matter if the government files suit 

arizona department of environmental quality – morenci  in october 2008 freeportmcmoran morenci inc morenci notified state and federal authorities that it accidentally released electrolyte solution from its solution extraction and electrowinning sxew operation into lower chase creek an ephemeral stream that is normally dry morenci conducted a thorough cleanup of the spill and later provided authorities with information on corrective actions implemented in response to the spill on january 16 2009 morenci received notices of violation novs from the arizona department of environmental quality alleging that the spill resulted in violations of the arizona pollutant discharge elimination system and aquifer protection programs morenci also received a letter dated january 28 2010 from the arizona attorney general’s office advising morenci that the state of arizona intends to file a civil enforcement action morenci has met with the arizona attorney general’s office to discuss a potential settlement and expects to reach an agreement that includes payment of a civil penalty which may exceed 100000 

 

  

asbestos claims 

since approximately 1990 phelps dodge and various subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a large number of lawsuits that claim personal injury from exposure to asbestos allegedly contained in electrical wire products produced or marketed many years ago either from asbestos contained in buildings and facilities located at properties owned or operated by phelps dodge affiliates or from alleged asbestos in talc products many of these suits involve a large number of codefendants based on litigation results to date and facts currently known fcx believes its liability if any in these matters will not have a material adverse effect either individually or in the aggregate upon its business financial condition liquidity results of operations or cash flow there can be no assurance however that future developments will not alter this conclusion 

water rights 

water law in the western us is generally based on the doctrine of prior appropriation first in time first in right and permits the water right holder the right to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location our operations in the western us require water for mining ore processing and related support facilities continuous operation of these mines is dependent on our ability to maintain our water rights and claims the loss of water rights in whole or in part could have a significant adverse affect on our mining operations 

two water rights adjudications have been initiated in the state of arizona in order to quantify and prioritize all surface water claims in two of the state’s river systems that include four of our operating mines morenci sierrita miami and safford any precedents set in these legal proceedings may also impact our bagdad arizona mine these adjudications have been under way for many years and we cannot predict when they will be concluded

in 1998 we entered into a water rights settlement agreement with the gila river indian community gric which was later included in a comprehensive water rights settlement under the arizona water settlements act of 2004 the gric settlement is subject to contingencies and the comprehensive settlement has been challenged by other parties if we are unable to resolve the contingencies in the gric settlement and defeat the thirdparty challenges our water rights in the gila river watershed could be diminished and our operations at morenci sierrita miami and safford could be adversely affected 

prior to january 1 1983 various indian tribes filed suits in the us district court in arizona claiming superior rights to water being used by many other water users including us and claiming damages for prior use in derogation of their allegedly superior rights these federal proceedings have been stayed pending the arizona superior court adjudications 

united states v gila valley irrigation district  united states district court district of arizona was initiated in 1925 by the united states to settle conflicting claims to water rights in portions of the gila river watershed a decree settling the claims of various parties was entered in 1935 after we had been dismissed from the case without prejudice in 1988 the gila river indian community intervened challenging uses of water in the gila river watershed which may impact water that we have the right to divert annually from eagle creek chase creek or the san francisco river for operation of our morenci mine pursuant to decreed rights and an agreement between us and the gila valley irrigation district our morenci operations also purchased farm lands with water rights in

general 

we are a leading international mining company with headquarters in phoenix arizona we are one of the world’s largest copper gold and molybdenum mining companies in terms of reserves and production our portfolio of assets includes the grasberg minerals district in indonesia which contains the largest single recoverable copper reserve and the largest single gold reserve of any mine in the world based on the latest available reserve data provided by thirdparty industry consultants significant mining operations in north and south america and the tenke fungurume minerals district in the democratic republic of congo drc we also operate atlantic copper our wholly owned copper smelting and refining unit in spain 

as a mining company our principal assets are our reserves at december 31 2009 consolidated recoverable proven and probable reserves totaled 1042 billion pounds of copper 372 million ounces of gold 259 billion pounds of molybdenum 2704 million ounces of silver and 078 billion pounds of cobalt approximately 33 percent of our copper reserves were in indonesia approximately 33 percent were in south america approximately 26 percent were in north america and approximately eight percent were in africa approximately 96 percent of our gold reserves were in indonesia with the majority of our remaining gold reserves located in south america our molybdenum reserves are primarily in north america approximately 80 percent with our remaining molybdenum reserves in south america refer to “ore reserves” 

our mining revenues for 2009 include sales of copper approximately 75 percent gold approximately 17 percent and molybdenum approximately five percent we currently have six operating copper mines in north america four in south america the grasberg minerals district in indonesia and the tenke fungurume minerals district in the drc we also have one operating primary molybdenum mine in north america during 2009 approximately 61 percent of our consolidated copper production was from our grasberg morenci and cerro verde mines and more than half of our mined copper was sold in concentrate approximately 25 percent as cathodes and approximately 21 percent as rod principally from our north america operations we also produce gold as a byproduct at our copper mines primarily at the grasberg minerals district in indonesia which accounted for approximately 96 percent of our consolidated gold production for 2009 for 2009 approximately 50 percent of our consolidated molybdenum production was from the henderson molybdenum mine and approximately 46 percent was produced as a byproduct at our north america copper mines refer to “mines” for further discussion of our mining operations 

prior to march 19 2007 we operated our grasberg mine in indonesia and atlantic copper on march 19 2007 we acquired phelps dodge a fully integrated producer of copper and molybdenum with mines in north and south america and several development projects including tenke fungurume in the drc after completion of the phelps dodge acquisition our business strategy was focused on repaying acquisitionrelated debt defining the potential of our resources and developing expansion and growth plans to deliver additional volumes to a growing marketplace during 2007 we repaid 100 billion in term loans using a combination of equity proceeds and internally generated cash flows because of the significant reduction in debt and historically high prices for copper gold and molybdenum our financial policy during most of 2008 was designed to use our cash flow to invest in growth projects with anticipated high rates of return and to return excess cash flows to stockholders in the form of dividends and share purchases the dramatic declines in copper and molybdenum prices in late 2008 and the deterioration of the economic and credit environment limited our ability to invest in growth projects and 

  

  

required us to make adjustments to our nearterm plans in late 2008 and early 2009 refer to note 2 for further discussion however during 2009 copper prices improved from the january 2009 low of 138 per pound to 333 per pound on december 31 2009 and subsequently closed at 311 per pound on january 29 2010 rising copper prices along with higher volumes from the grasberg mine and lower costs at our north america mines enabled us to enhance our financial and liquidity position during 2009 allowing us to manage volatile conditions effectively reduce debt and reinstate cash dividends to stockholders while maintaining our future growth opportunities in addition we have announced initiatives to resume certain project development activities that were deferred in late 2008 for additional information refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

in north america we currently have six operating copper mines – morenci sierrita bagdad safford and miami in arizona and tyrone in new mexico in addition to copper the morenci sierrita and bagdad mines produce molybdenum as a byproduct although we currently are not conducting mining operations at our chino mine in new mexico we continue to produce copper from leaching operations 

in south america we have four operating copper mines – cerro verde in peru and candelaria ojos del salado and el abra in chile in addition to copper the cerro verde mine produces molybdenum concentrate as a byproduct and the candelaria and ojos del salado mines produce gold and silver as byproducts 

in indonesia pt freeport indonesia operates the grasberg minerals district our grasberg minerals district also produces significant quantities of gold and silver as byproducts pt freeport indonesia also owns 25 percent of pt smelting a smelting and refining company in gresik indonesia 

in africa we operate the tenke fungurume minerals district in addition to copper the tenke fungurume mine produces cobalt hydroxide copper production commenced in march 2009 and tenke achieved targeted copper production rates in september 2009 we are continuing to address startup and quality issues in the cobalt circuit and sustained targeted cobalt production rates are expected to be reached during 2010 

we produce molybdenum at our wholly owned henderson molybdenum mine in colorado which is the largest primary producer of molybdenum in the world additionally we own the climax molybdenum mine in colorado which is currently on careandmaintenance status 

for information about our operating segments and financial data by geographic area refer to note 20 

the locations of our operating mines are shown on the map below 

  

the diagram below shows our corporate structure 

copper gold and molybdenum 

our mines primarily produce copper gold and molybdenum a brief discussion of the production and sales of these metals appears below discussion of markets and prices for these metals appears in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

copper 

copper in the form of copper cathode is an internationally traded commodity and its prices are determined by the major metals exchanges – new york mercantile exchange comex the london metals exchange lme and the shanghai futures exchange shfe prices on these exchanges generally reflect the worldwide balance of copper supply and demand and can be volatile and cyclical 

our copper ores are generally processed either by smelting and refining or by solution extraction and electrowinning sxew ore subject to the smelting process is crushed and further treated to produce a copper concentrate with an average copper content of about 30 percent copper concentrate is then smelted subjected to extreme heat to produce copper anodes which weigh between 800 and 900 pounds each and have an average copper content of 995 percent the anodes are further treated by electrolytic refining to produce copper cathodes which weigh between 100 and 350 pounds each and have a copper content of 9999 percent 

in the sxew process copper is extracted from ore by dissolving it with a weak sulphuric acid solution the copper content of the solution is increased in two additional solutionextraction stages and then the copperbearing solution undergoes an electrowinning process to produce cathode that is 9999 percent copper 

our copper cathodes are used as the raw material input for copper rod brass mill products and for other uses in general demand for copper reflects the rate of underlying world economic growth particularly in industrial production and construction according to brook hunt a widely followed independent metals market consultant copper’s enduse markets and their estimated shares of total consumption are 

 

 

gold 

gold is used for jewelry coinage and bullion as well as various industrial and electronic applications gold can be readily sold on numerous markets throughout the world benchmark prices are generally based on london bullion market association quotations 

molybdenum 

molybdenum is a key alloying element in steel and the raw material for several chemicalgrade products used in catalysts lubrication smoke suppression corrosion inhibition and pigmentation molybdenum as a highpurity metal is also used in electronics such as flatpanel displays and in super alloys used in aerospace molybdenum’s enduse markets and their share of total consumption are 

 

reference prices for molybdenum are available in several publications including platts metals week  ryan’s notes and metal bulletin  

products and sales 

copper products 

we are one of the world’s leading producers of copper concentrate cathode and continuous cast copper rod during 2009 approximately 61 percent of our consolidated copper production was from our grasberg morenci and cerro verde mines and more than half of our mined copper was sold in concentrate approximately 25 percent as cathodes and approximately 21 percent as rod principally from our north america operations 

copper concentrate  in 2009 we produced copper concentrate at seven mines of which pt freeport indonesia is our largest producer approximately 50 percent of pt freeport indonesia’s concentrate production in 2009 was refined at affiliated smelters atlantic copper and pt smelting 

copper concentrate was also produced at our morenci sierrita and bagdad mines in arizona and was generally shipped to our miami smelter in arizona in south america we produced copper concentrate at our cerro verde mine in peru and our candelaria and ojos del salado mines in chile we are initiating activities to restart the morenci mill which was temporarily idled in february 2009 to process available sulfide material currently being mined 

copper cathode  in 2009 we produced copper cathode at two electrolytic refineries and ten mines our refineries are located in el paso texas and huelva spain pt smelting also produces copper cathode we produced sxew cathode from our morenci sierrita bagdad chino safford tyrone and miami mines in north america and our cerro verde and el abra mines in south america in 2009 we began sxew production at our tenke fungurume mine in the drc  

continuous cast copper rod  we manufacture continuous cast copper rod at our facilities in el paso texas norwich connecticut and miami arizona 

 

other copper products  we produce specialty copper products at our bayway operations in elizabeth new jersey these products include specialty copper alloys in the forms of rod bar and strip we manufacture electrode wire for use in welding steel cans at our norwich connecticut and el paso texas facilities we also produce copper sulfate pentahydrate for use in agricultural and industrial applications at our facility in sierrita arizona 

copper sales 

north america  the majority of the copper produced at our north america copper mines and refined in our el paso refinery is consumed at our rod plants in el paso texas norwich connecticut and miami arizona the remainder of our north america copper production is sold in the form of copper cathode or copper concentrate to third parties generally copper rod and cathode are sold to wire and cable fabricators and brass mills under united states us dollardenominated annual contracts cathode and rod contract prices are generally based on the prevailing comex monthly average spot price for the month of shipment and include a premium 

south america    production from our south america copper mines is generally sold as copper concentrate or copper cathode under us dollardenominated annual and multiyear contracts cerro verde sells approximately 70 percent of its production as concentrate and the rest as cathode some of cerro verde’s cathode is sold under annual contract terms to south american customers approximately 22 percent of cerro verde’s and 11 percent of candelaria’s 2009 concentrate production was sold at market rates to atlantic copper a majority of our ojos del salado concentrate production is sold to local chilean smelters el abra’s cathode production is sold primarily under annual or multiyear contracts to asian or european rod or brass mill customers or to merchants the remainder of the cathode and concentrate production is primarily sold under longterm contracts to external customers largely located in asia with the balance sold on a spot basis 

our south america sales are priced based on the lme monthly average spot price cathode sales are generally priced in the month of arrival at the buyer’s facilities and generally include a premium substantially all of our concentrate sales are priced in the third calendar month following the month of arrival at the buyer’s facilities revenues from south america concentrate sales are recorded net of treatment and refining charges treatment and refining charges are fees paid to smelters and refiners and are generally negotiated annually moreover because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrates is unrecoverable from the smelting process our revenues from concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances based on the quantity and value of these unrecoverable metals these allowances are a negotiated term of our contracts and vary by customer 

indonesia    pt freeport indonesia sells its production in the form of copper concentrate which contains significant quantities of byproduct gold and silver under us dollardenominated sales agreements during 2009 approximately half of pt freeport indonesia’s production was sold to atlantic copper and pt smelting pt freeport indonesia sells substantially all of its budgeted production of copper concentrates under longterm contracts in general most of its concentrate sales are priced on the basis of the lme average spot price for either the first second or third calendar month following the month of arrival at the buyer’s facilities 

pt freeport indonesia has a longterm contract to provide atlantic copper with approximately 55 percent of its current concentrate requirements at market prices 

  

pt freeport indonesia’s contract with pt smelting provides for the supply of 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements necessary to produce 205000 metric tons of copper annually essentially the smelter’s original design capacity on a priority basis refer to “smelting facilities” for further discussion 

we anticipate that pt freeport indonesia will sell approximately 60 percent of its annual concentrate production to atlantic copper and pt smelting in 2010 a summary of pt freeport indonesia’s aggregate percentage concentrate sales to pt smelting atlantic copper and to other parties for the last three years follows 

 

pt freeport indonesia’s sales to pt smelting represented approximately 13 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2009 approximately eight percent in 2008 and approximately 11 percent in 2007 no other customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated revenues in any of the three years ended december 31 2009 

revenues from our indonesia concentrate sales are recorded net of royalties refer to “mines – indonesia – contracts of work” and treatment and refining charges including price participation charges if applicable based on the market prices of metals similar to our south america mines indonesia concentrate sales are net of allowances for unrecoverable metals pt freeport indonesia sells a small amount of copper concentrates in the spot market 

africa  copper produced at our tenke fungurume mining district is generally sold as copper cathode under us dollar denominated contracts priced based on the lme monthly average spot price for the month after the month of shipment 

europe    atlantic copper sells copper cathode directly to rod and brass mills primarily located in europe atlantic copper has occasionally sold copper cathode to merchants copper cathode is generally sold under annual contracts and priced based on the lme average spot price for the month of arrival at the buyer’s facilities 

gold products and sales 

we also produce gold as a byproduct primarily at the grasberg minerals district which accounted for approximately 96 percent of our consolidated gold production in 2009 gold is primarily sold as a component of our copper concentrate or in slimes which are a byproduct of the smelting and refining process gold generally is priced at the average london bullion market association price for a specified month near the month of shipment 

molybdenum products and sales 

we are the world’s largest producer of molybdenum and molybdenumbased chemicals in addition to production from our henderson molybdenum mine we produce byproduct molybdenum at our morenci sierrita and bagdad mines in arizona and at our cerro verde mine in peru for 2009 approximately half of our consolidated molybdenum production was from the henderson molybdenum mine and approximately 46 percent was produced as a byproduct at the north america mines 

the majority of our molybdenum concentrates are processed in our own conversion facilities technicalgrade oxide is produced from molybdenum concentrates in sierrita arizona fort madison iowa and rotterdam the netherlands ferromolybdenum is produced from technicalgrade oxide in stowmarket united kingdom through a metallothermic reduction process highquality molybdenum concentrates are converted into molybdenum chemicals at fort madison iowa and rotterdam the netherlands molybdenum generally is priced based on the average platts metals week price for the month of shipment approximately 90 percent of our expected 2010 molybdenum sales are expected to be priced at prevailing market prices 

other products and sales 

we produce cobalt as a cobalt hydroxide intermediate byproduct of copper production at the tenke fungurume mine in the drc and silver as a component of our copper concentrate or in slimes cobalt hydroxide intermediate product is priced based on a discount to the average monthly price published by metal bulletin for a specified month near the month of shipment and silver generally is priced at the average london bullion market association price for a specified month near the month of shipment sales of cobalt and silver along with other byproduct metals such as rhenium and magnetite do not represent a significant component of our total revenues

pt freeport indonesia is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the republic of indonesia and incorporated in delaware we directly own 8128 percent of pt freeport indonesia 936 percent indirectly through our wholly owned subsidiary pt indocopper investama and the government of indonesia owns the remaining 936 percent in july 2004 we received a request from the indonesian department of energy and mineral resources that we offer to sell shares in pt indocopper investama to indonesian nationals at fair market value refer to note 15 for additional discussion 

in 1996 we established certain unincorporated joint ventures with rio tinto plc rio tinto an international mining company with headquarters in london england pursuant to the joint venture agreements rio tinto has a 40 percent interest in certain assets and future production exceeding specified annual amounts of copper gold and silver through 2021 in block a and after 2021 a 40 percent interest in all production from block a refer to note 3 for further discussion of the joint venture with rio tinto 

contracts of work 

through a contract of work cow with the government of indonesia pt freeport indonesia conducts its current exploration and mining operations in indonesia the cow governs our rights and obligations relating to taxes exchange controls royalties repatriation and other matters and was concluded pursuant to the 1967 foreign capital investment law which expresses indonesia’s foreign investment policy and provides basic guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization a framework for economic incentives and basic rules regarding other rights and obligations of foreign investors specifically the cow provides that the government of indonesia will not nationalize or expropriate pt freeport indonesia’s mining operations any disputes regarding the provisions of the cow are subject to international arbitration we have experienced no disputes requiring arbitration during the 41 years we have operated in indonesia 

pt freeport indonesia’s cow covers both block a which was first included in a 1967 cow that was replaced by a new cow in 1991 and block b in which we gained rights in 1991 the initial term of our cow expires in december 2021 but we can extend it for two 10year periods subject to indonesian government approval that cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably the cow allows us to conduct exploration mining and production activities in the 24700acre block a area located in papua all of pt freeport indonesia’s proven and probable mineral reserves and current mining operations are located in block a under the cow pt freeport indonesia also conducts exploration activities which had been suspended in 2009 but will resume in 2010 in the approximate 500000acre block b area in papua we originally had the rights to explore 65 million acres in block b but pursuant to the cow we have only retained the rights to approximately 500000 acres following 

  

  

significant geological assessment 

pt freeport indonesia pays a copper royalty under its cow that varies from 15 percent of copper net revenue at a copper price of 090 or less per pound to 35 percent at a copper price of 110 or more per pound the cow royalty rate for gold and silver sales is 10 percent 

a large part of the mineral royalties under government of indonesia regulations are designated to the provinces from which the minerals are extracted in connection with our fourth concentrator mill expansion completed in 1998 pt freeport indonesia agreed to pay the government of indonesia additional royalties royalties not required by our cow to provide further support to the local governments and the people of the indonesia province of papua the additional royalties are paid on production exceeding specified annual amounts of copper gold and silver expected to be generated when pt freeport indonesia’s milling facilities operate above 200000 metric tons of ore per day the additional royalty for copper equals the cow royalty rate and for gold and silver equals twice the cow royalty rates therefore pt freeport indonesia’s royalty rate on copper net revenues from production above the agreed levels is double the cow royalty rate and royalty rates on gold and silver sales from production above the agreed levels are triple the cow royalty rates pt freeport indonesia’s share of the combined royalties including the additional royalties which became effective january 1 1999 totaled 147 million in 2009 113 million in 2008 and 133 million in 2007

in 2008 indonesia enacted a new mining law which will operate under a licensing system as opposed to the cow system that applies to pt freeport indonesia eastern minerals and ptnbm in 2010 the government of indonesia promulgated regulations under the 2008 mining law and certain provisions address existing cows the regulations provide that cows will continue to be honored until their expiration however the regulations attempt to apply certain provisions of the new law to any extension periods of cows even though our cows provide for two tenyear extension periods under the existing terms of our cows 

 

 

grasberg minerals district 

pt freeport indonesia operates in the remote highlands of the sudirman mountain range in the province of papua indonesia which is on the western half of the island of new guinea we and our predecessors have conducted exploration and mining operations in block a since 1967 and have been the only operator of these operations we currently have two mines in operation the grasberg open pit and the deep ore zone doz underground block cave we also have significant development projects in the grasberg minerals district which are discussed in more detail in “development projects and exploration” below and in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations” 

grasberg open pit    we began openpit mining of the grasberg ore body in 1990 openpit operations are expected to continue through mid 2016 at which time underground mining operations are scheduled to begin at our grasberg block cave mine which is currently in development production is currently at the 3295 to 4285meter elevation level and totaled 57 million metric tons of ore in 2009 and 49 million metric tons of ore in 2008 which provided 70 percent of our 2009 mill feed and 67 percent of our 2008 mill feed remaining mill feed comes from our doz mine 

the current grasberg equipment fleet consists of over 500 units the larger mining equipment directly associated with production includes an available fleet of 163 haul trucks with payloads ranging from approximately 215 metric tons to 330 metric tons and 18 shovels with bucket sizes ranging from 30 cubic meters to 42 cubic meters which in 2009 moved an average of 725000 metric tons per day 

grasberg crushing and conveying systems are integral to the mine and provide the capacity to transport up to 225000 metric tons per day of grasberg ore to the mill and 135000 metric tons per day of overburden to the overburden stockpiles the remaining ore and overburden is moved by haul trucks 

deep ore zone  the doz ore body lies vertically below the now depleted intermediate ore zone we began production from the doz ore body in 1989 using open stope mining methods but we suspended production in 1991 in favor of production from the grasberg deposit production resumed in september 2000 using the blockcave method production is at the 3110meter elevation level and totaled 26 million metric tons of ore in 2009 and 23 million metric tons in 2008 production at the doz mine is expected to continue through 2020 and we plan to ramp up production at our deep mill level zone dmlz block cave mine which is currently under development beginning in 2015 

during 2009 we completed over 11000 meters of development drifting in support of the blockcave mining method for the doz mine further expansion of the doz operation to 80000 metric tons of ore per day is substantially complete the success of the development of the doz mine one of the world’s largest underground 

  

  

mines provides confidence in the future development of pt freeport indonesia’s largescale undeveloped underground ore bodies 

the doz mine fleet consists of over 185 pieces of mobile heavy equipment which in 2009 moved an average of 72000 metric tons of ore per day the primary mining equipment directly associated with production and development includes an available fleet of 49 load haul dump lhd units and 23 haul trucks our production lhd units typically carry approximately 11 metric tons of ore using ore passes and chutes the lhd units transfer ore into 55ton capacity haul trucks the trucks dump into two gyratory crushers and the ore is then conveyed to the surface stockpiles 

pt freeport indonesia’s total production for 2009 was 14 billion pounds of copper and 26 million ounces of gold 

our principal source of power for all our indonesian operations is a coalfired power plant that we built in conjunction with our fourth concentrator mill expansion diesel generators supply peaking and backup electrical power generating capacity a combination of naturally occurring mountain streams and water derived from our underground operations provides water for our operations our indonesian operations are in an active seismic zone and experience average annual rainfall of approximately 200 inches 

description of ore bodies  our indonesia ore bodies are located within and around two main igneous intrusions the grasberg monzodiorite and the ertsberg diorite the host rocks of these ore bodies include both carbonate and clastic rocks that form the ridge crests and upper flanks of the sudirman range and the igneous rocks of monzonitic to dioritic composition that intrude them the igneoushosted ore bodies the grasberg open pit and block cave and portions of the doz block cave occur as vein stockworks and disseminations of copper sulfides dominated by chalcopyrite and to a much lesser extent bornite the sedimentaryrock hosted ore bodies occur as “magnetiterich calciummagnesian skarn” replacements whose location and orientation are strongly influenced by major faults and by the chemistry of the carbonate rocks along the margins of the intrusions 

the copper mineralization in these skarn deposits is also dominated by chalcopyrite but higher bornite concentrations are common moreover gold occurs in significant concentrations in all of the district’s ore bodies though rarely visible to the naked eye these gold concentrations usually occur as inclusions within the copper sulfide minerals though in some deposits these concentrations can also be strongly associated with pyrite 

the following diagram indicates the relative elevations in meters of our reported ore bodies 

the following map which encompasses an area of approximately 42 square kilometers approximately 16 square miles indicates the relative positions and sizes of our reported ore bodies and their locations

in 2009 we completed the approximate 2 billion initial project at the tenke fungurume minerals district pursuant to our agreement with lundin we were responsible for funding our share 70 percent of the project development costs and 100 percent of certain cost overruns on the initial project we and lundin will be repaid our advances prior to distributions to the stockholders of tenke fungurume accordingly we will receive a disproportionate share of cash flow until the cost overrun financing and advances are repaid additionally in accordance with the terms of the agreement gécamines will receive asset transfer payments totaling 100 million 80 million of which have already been paid and the remainder of which will be paid over the next two years 

the tenke fungurume deposits are located in the katanga province of the drc approximately 110 miles northwest of lubumbashi the deposits are accessible by unpaved roads and by rail the tenke fungurume deposits are sedimenthosted copper and cobalt deposits with oxide mixed oxidesulfide and sulfide mineralization the dominant oxide minerals are malachite pseudomalachite and heterogenite important sulfide minerals consist of bornite carrollite chalcocite and chalcopyrite 

copper and cobalt are recovered through an agitationleach plant capable of processing 8000 metric tons of ore per day copper production commenced in march 2009 and achieved targeted production rates in september 2009 the cobalt and sulphuric acid plants were commissioned in september 2009 and we continue to address startup and quality issues in the cobalt circuit and expect to reach sustained targeted production rates during 2010 current operations are designed to produce approximately 250 million pounds of copper and 18 million pounds of cobalt per year the current equipment fleet includes 10 fivecubic meter frontend loaders 29 45metric ton haul trucks surface miners production drills sampling machines and crawler dozers 

we commenced a feasibility study in fourthquarter 2009 to evaluate a second phase of the project which would include optimizing the current plant and potentially increasing capacity by approximately 50 percent the feasibility study is expected to be completed by midyear 2010 the timing of these expansions will depend on a number of factors including general economic and market conditions 

tenke fungurume is located in a tropical region however temperatures are moderated by its higher altitudes weather in this region is characterized by a dry season and a wet season each lasting about six months with average rainfall of 47 inches per year the highest bench elevation is expected to be 1480 meters above sea level and the ultimate pit bottom is expected to be 1270 meters above sea level the tenke fungurume deposits are located within four concessions totaling 394455 acres 

tenke fungurume has entered into longterm power supply and infrastructure funding agreements with la société nationale d’electricité snel the stateowned electric utility company serving the region the results of a recent water exploration program as well as the regional geological and hydrogeological conditions indicate that adequate water is available for the project and for hydroelectric generation during the expected life of the operation 

in february 2008 the ministry of mines government of the drc sent a letter seeking comment on proposed material modifications to the mining contracts for the tenke fungurume concession we are continuing to work cooperatively with the drc government to resolve the ongoing contract review but cannot predict the timing or outcome of the process the contract review process has not affected our development schedule and we are continuing to operate pursuant to the terms of our contract we believe the contract is fair and equitable complies with congolese law and is enforceable without modification

development projects and exploration 

 

we have several projects and potential opportunities to expand our production volumes extend our mine lives and develop largescale underground ore bodies during fourthquarter 2008 we deferred several project development activities because of the downturn in global economic conditions major development projects for 2009 consisted of underground development in the grasberg minerals district and the tenke fungurume project for which construction activities on the initial project are complete during fourthquarter 2009 we announced that we are resuming certain project development activities that were deferred for further discussion of our development projects and exploration activities refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

as discussed in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we have several projects in progress in the grasberg mineral district including development of the common infrastructure project grasberg block cave the big gossan underground mine a further expansion of the doz underground mine which is substantially complete and development of the deep mill level zone ore body we also have an additional longterm underground mine development project in the grasberg minerals district for the kucing liar ore body which is discussed below and is based on our latest mine plans and proven and probable reserves as of december 31 2009 

the kucing liar ore body lies on the southern flank of and underneath the southern portion of the grasberg open pit at the 2605meter elevation level we expect to mine the kucing liar ore body using the blockcave method a prefeasibility study for the development of the kucing liar ore body was completed during 2009 and indicated aggregate capital costs of approximately 25 billion 

based on current estimates we expect aggregate expenditures for underground mine development in the grasberg minerals district to average approximately 450 million annually during the next 15 years these costs will be shared with rio tinto in accordance with our joint venture agreement considering the longterm nature and large size of these projects actual costs could differ materially from these estimates 

in addition to the mine development costs above our current mine development plans include approximately 3 billion of capital expenditures at our processing facilities to optimize the handling of underground ore types once grasberg openpit operations cease substantially all of these expenditures will be made between 2017 and 2029 we continue to review our mine development and processing plans to maximize the value of our reserves 

smelting facilities 

atlantic copper sa atlantic copper is our wholly owned copper smelter and refinery located in huelva spain atlantic copper completed the last expansion of its production capacity in 1997 the design capacity of the smelter is 290000 metric tons of copper per year and the refinery currently has a capacity of 260000 metric tons of copper per year we have no present plans to expand atlantic copper’s production capacity atlantic copper’s facilities are located on land concessions from the huelva spain port authorities and expire in 2027 

during 2009 atlantic copper treated 1000700 metric tons of concentrate and scrap and produced 269000 metric tons of copper anodes and 256600 metric tons of copper cathodes during 2008 atlantic copper treated 1028100 metric tons of concentrate and scrap and produced 259900 metric tons of copper anodes and 257100 metric tons of copper cathodes in june 2007 atlantic copper completed a scheduled 23day maintenance turnaround major maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately every 12 years for atlantic copper with significantly shorter term maintenance turnarounds occurring in the interim the next scheduled maintenance 

  

  

activity at atlantic copper is in 2011 

during 2009 atlantic copper purchased approximately 35 percent of its concentrate requirements from pt freeport indonesia and approximately 25 percent from our south america copper mines at market prices atlantic copper has experienced no significant operating problems 

we made no capital contributions to atlantic copper from 2005 through 2009 we loan funds to atlantic copper from time to time and at december 31 2009 these loans totaled 381 million our net investment in atlantic copper at december 31 2009 was approximately 70 million 

pt smelting  pt freeport indonesia’s 1991 cow required us to construct or cause to be constructed a smelter in indonesia if we and the indonesian government determined that such a project would be economically viable in 1995 following the completion of a feasibility study we entered into agreements relating to the formation of pt smelting an indonesian company and the construction of the copper smelter and refinery in gresik indonesia pt freeport indonesia mitsubishi materials corporation mitsubishi materials mitsubishi corporation mitsubishi and nippon mining  metals co ltd nippon own 25 percent 605 percent 95 percent and 5 percent respectively of the outstanding pt smelting common stock pt smelting owns and operates the smelter and refinery in gresik indonesia 

during 2006 pt smelting completed an expansion of its production capacity to 275000 metric tons of copper per year from 250000 metric tons pt freeport indonesia’s contract with pt smelting provides for the supply of 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements necessary for pt smelting to produce 205000 metric tons of copper annually essentially the smelter’s original design capacity on a priority basis for the first 15 years of pt smelting’s commercial operations beginning december 1998 pt freeport indonesia agreed that the combined treatment and refining charges fees paid to smelters by miners would approximate market rates but will not fall below specified minimum rates the minimum rate applicable to the period april 27 2008 to april 27 2014 is to be determined annually and to be sufficient to cover pt smelting’s annual cash operating costs net of credits and including costs of debt service for 205000 metric tons of copper the maximum rate is 030 per pound the agreement is an amendment to the longterm contract which was approved by the department of energy and mineral resources of the government of indonesia in 2009 pt freeport indonesia also sells copper concentrate to pt smelting at market rates which are not subject to a minimum or maximum rate for quantities in excess of 205000 metric tons of copper annually 

during 2009 pt smelting treated 1073900 metric tons of concentrate and produced 310200 metric tons of copper anodes and 286000 metric tons of copper cathodes during 2008 pt smelting treated 978100 metric tons of concentrate and produced 261300 metric tons of copper anodes and 253400 metric tons of copper cathodes higher volumes of anodes in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily reflect a 25day maintenance turnaround in the second quarter of 2008 major maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately every four years for pt smelting with significantly shorter term maintenance turnarounds in the interim 

miami smelter  we own and operate a smelter at our miami arizona mining operation the smelter processes concentrate primarily from our arizona mines the smelter has been in production for over 80 years and has been upgraded during that period to implement new technologies to improve production and to comply with current air quality standards concentrate processed through the smelter totaled approximately 619000 metric tons in 2009 and 719000 metric tons in 2008 the miami smelter completed a 40day major maintenance turnaround in february 2009 major maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately every 20 months for miami with significantly shorter term maintenance turnarounds in the interim sulphuric acid is a byproduct of smelting concentrates and the miami smelter is the most significant source of sulphuric acid for our us leaching operations 

other properties 

rod  refining operations   our rod  refining operations consist of conversion facilities located in north america including a refinery in el paso texas rod mills in el paso texas norwich connecticut and miami arizona and a specialty copper products facility in bayway new jersey we refine our copper anode production from our smelter in miami arizona along with purchased anodes at our el paso refinery the el paso refinery has an annual production capacity of about 900 million pounds of copper cathode which is sufficient to refine all the copper anode we produce at miami our el paso refinery also produces nickel carbonate copper telluride and autoclaved slimes material containing gold silver platinum and palladium

sources and availability of raw materials 

energy including electricity diesel fuel coal and natural gas sulphuric acid and water are the principal raw materials used in our operations most of our energy is obtained from third parties under longterm contracts for additional information refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

sulphuric acid is used in the sxew process and is produced as a byproduct of the smelting process at our smelters sulphuric acid needs in excess of the sulphuric acid produced by our operations are purchased from third parties as needed 

our mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining ore processing and related support facilities although we believe our mining operations have sufficient water rights the loss of water rights for any of our mines in whole or in part or shortages of water to which we have rights could require us to curtail or shut down mining operations for a further discussion of risks and legal proceedings associated with the availability of water see item 1a – “risk factors” and item 3 – “legal proceedings” 

competition 

 

we are one of the world’s largest copper gold and molybdenum mining companies in terms of reserves and production with respect to copper which generated approximately 75 percent of our mining revenues in 2009 the top 10 producers comprise approximately 55 percent of total worldwide mined copper production we currently rank second among those producers at approximately 10 percent of total worldwide estimated mined copper production our competitive position is based on the quality and grade of our ore bodies and our ability to manage costs compared with other producers we have a diverse portfolio of mining operations with varying ore grades and cost structures our costs are driven by the location grade and nature of our ore bodies and the input costs including energy labor and equipment the metals markets are cyclical and our ability to maintain our competitive position over the long term is based on our ability to acquire and develop quality deposits hire and retain a skilled workforce and to manage our costs 

 

labor matters 

at december 31 2009 we employed approximately 28400 people approximately 11900 in indonesia 8400 in north america 4400 in south america 2900 in africa and 800 in europe and other locations additionally we have contractors that have personnel at many of our operations including approximately 8600 at our grasberg minerals district 4900 at our south america operations 2100 at tenke fungurume 600 in north america and 400 at atlantic copper employees represented by unions are listed below with the approximate number of employees represented and the expiration date of the applicable union agreements 

 

 

fm services company fm services a wholly owned subsidiary of fcx furnishes certain executive administrative financial accounting legal tax and similar services to us as of december 31 2009 fm services had 167 employees fm services employees also provide these services to two other publicly traded companies 

environmental and reclamation matters 

the costs of complying with environmental laws is a fundamental and substantial cost of our business for information about environmental regulation litigation and related costs see item 1a – “risk factors” item 3 “legal proceedings” note 1 and note 14 

community and human rights 

we have adopted policies that govern our working relationships with the communities where we operate that are designed to guide our practices and programs in a manner that respects basic human rights and the culture of the local people impacted by our operations we continue to make significant expenditures on community development education training and cultural programs which include 

·   comprehensive job training programs 

·   basic education programs 

·   public health programs including malaria control 

·   agricultural assistance programs 

·   small and medium enterprise development programs 

·   cultural preservation programs 

·     water and sewage treatment projects 

·     clean water access 

·   charitable donations 

in december 2000 we endorsed the joint us state departmentbritish foreign office voluntary principles on human rights and security “voluntary principles” several major natural resources companies and international human rights organizations participated in developing the voluntary principles and have endorsed them we participated in developing these principles and they are incorporated into our human rights policy 

we believe that our social and economic development programs are responsive to the issues raised by the local communities near our areas of operation and should help us maintain good relations with the surrounding communities and avoid disruptions of mining operations nevertheless social and political instability in the areas of our operations may adversely impact our mining operations see item 1a – “risk factors” 

south america  cerro verde has provided a variety of community support projects over the years during 2006 as a result of discussions with local mayors in the arequipa region cerro verde agreed to contribute to the design and construction of domestic water and sewage treatment plants for the benefit of the region these facilities are being designed in a modular fashion so that initial installations can be readily expanded in the future we have funded approximately 150 million peruvian nuevo soles approximately 49 million as of december 31 2009 to a designated bank account to be used for financing cerro verde’s share of the construction costs of these facilities 

during 2006 the peruvian government announced that all mining companies operating in peru will make annual contributions to local development funds for a fiveyear period when copper prices exceed certain levels that are adjusted annually the contribution is equal to 375 percent of aftertax profits of which 275 percent is contributed to a local mining fund and 100 percent to a regional mining fund cerro verde’s contributions totaled 28 million in both 2009 and 2008 and 49 million in 2007 

indonesia  in 1996 pt freeport indonesia established the freeport partnership fund for community development formerly the freeport fund for irian jaya development through which pt freeport indonesia has made available funding and technical assistance to support the economic health education and social development of the area pt freeport indonesia has committed through 2011 to provide one percent of its annual revenue for the development of the local people in its area of operation through the partnership fund our share of contributions to the partnership fund totaled 59 million in 2009 34 million in 2008 and 48 million in 2007 our joint venture partner rio tinto also contributes to this fund and including their share the contributions totaled 69 million in 2009 35 million in 2008 and 53 million in 2007 

the amungme and kamoro community development organization  lembaga pembangunan masyarakat amungme dan kamoro or lpmak oversees disbursement of the program funds we contribute to the partnership fund lpmak is governed by a board of commissioners and a board of directors which are comprised of representatives from the local amungme and kamoro tribal communities government leaders church leaders and one representative of pt freeport indonesia on each board the amungme and kamoro people are original inhabitants of the land in our area of operations 

security matters in indonesia    consistent with our cow in indonesia and the requirement to protect our employees and property we have taken appropriate steps to provide a safe and secure working environment as part of its security program pt freeport indonesia maintains its own internal security department which performs functions such as protecting company facilities monitoring the shipment of company goods through the airport and terminal assisting in traffic control and aiding rescue operations pt freeport indonesia’s civilian security employees numbering approximately 725 are unarmed and perform duties consistent with their internal security role pt freeport indonesia’s share of costs for its internal civilian security department totaled approximately 18 million for 2009 22 million for 2008 and 17 million for 2007 the security department has received human rights training and each member is required to certify his or her compliance with our human rights policy 

pt freeport indonesia and all businesses and residents of indonesia rely on the government of indonesia for the maintenance of public order upholding the rule of law and the protection of personnel and property the grasberg minerals district has been designated by the government of indonesia as one of indonesia’s vital national assets this designation results in the police and to a lesser extent the military playing a significant role in protecting the area of our operations the government of indonesia is responsible for employing police and military personnel and directing their operations 

from the outset of pt freeport indonesia’s operations the government has looked to pt freeport indonesia to provide logistical and infrastructure support and assistance for these necessary services because of the limited 

  

  

resources of the indonesian government and the remote location of and lack of development in papua pt freeport indonesia’s financial support for the indonesian government security institutions assigned to the operations area represents a prudent response to its requirements to protect its workforce and property better ensuring that personnel are properly fed and lodged and have the logistical resources to patrol pt freeport indonesia’s roads and secure its operating area in addition the provision of such support is consistent with pt freeport indonesia’s obligations under the cow reflects our philosophy of responsible corporate citizenship and is in keeping with our commitment to pursue practices that will promote human rights 

pt freeport indonesia’s share of support costs for the governmentprovided security currently involving approximately 3000 indonesian government security personnel located in the general area of our operations was 10 million for 2009 8 million for 2008 and 9 million for 2007 this supplemental support consists of various infrastructure and other costs such as food housing fuel travel vehicle repairs allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs and community assistance programs conducted by the military and police pt freeport indonesia’s capital costs for associated infrastructure was approximately 2 million in 2009 and less than 1 million a year in 2008 and 2007 

since july 2009 there have been a series of shooting incidents along the road leading to our mining and milling operations at the grasberg mining complex including an incident in january 2010 in connection with these incidents there have been three fatalities including a pt freeport indonesia employee a security contractor and an indonesian policeman and several injuries the indonesian government has responded with additional security forces and expressed a strong commitment to protect the safety of the community and our operations the investigation of these matters is continuing and we have taken precautionary measures including limiting use of the road to secured convoys our mining and milling activities have continued uninterrupted however prolonged limitations on access to the road could adversely affect operations at the mine see item 1a – “risk factors” 

as originally reported in january 2006 we received and responded to requests from us governmental authorities related to pt freeport indonesia’s support of indonesian security institutions in may 2009 we were notified by the sec that the us government’s investigation had been completed and no action has been recommended 

africa  tenke fungurume has committed to assist the communities living within its concession in the katanga province of the drc initiatives that have commenced over the past three years include a malaria control program construction and operational support for six elementary schools installation of over 40 clean water wells throughout the concession as well as five villages outside the concession a public sanitation latrines and hand washing program reaching over 2000 households a mobile clinic for rural villages and economic development programs supporting local entrepreneurs farmers and women’s income generation and literacy groups we have also made significant investments in infrastructure in the region that will have lasting benefits to the country including upgrading a national road and the regional power generation and transmission systems additionally we have committed to contribute 03 percent of net sales revenue from production to a community development fund to assist the local communities with development of local infrastructure and related services such as those pertaining to health education and economic development this fund will be a platform to work jointly with the local government and community to further assist them to fulfill their local development plans meet basic community needs and promote good governance community development fund contributions for 2009 totaled approximately 1 million 

similar to our operations in indonesia tenke fungurume is required to engage government security institutions to assist with security matters at its concession area in this regard tenke fungurume provides food housing monetary allowances and logistical support as well as direct payments to the government for the provision of the security assigned to the concession area the total cost to tenke fungurume for this support including inkind support totaled less than 1 million in 2009 

 

ore reserves 

recoverable proven and probable reserves summarized below and detailed on the following pages have been calculated as of december 31 2009 in accordance with industry guide 7 as required by the securities exchange act of 1934 proven and probable reserves may not be comparable to similar information regarding mineral reserves disclosed in accordance with the guidance of other countries proven and probable reserves were determined by the use of mapping drilling sampling assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry as more fully discussed below the term “reserve” as used in the reserve data presented here means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination the term “proven reserves” means reserves for which 1 quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops trenches workings or drill holes 2 grade andor quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and 3 the sites for inspection sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established the term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced the degree of assurance although lower than that for proven reserves is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 

our reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies we conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk we revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies our estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves are prepared by and are the responsibility of our employees and a majority of these estimates are reviewed and verified by independent experts in mining geology and reserve determination estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves at december 31 2009 were determined using longterm average prices of 160 per pound for copper 550 per ounce for gold 800 per pound for molybdenum 1200 per ounce for silver and 1000 per pound for cobalt the london spot metal prices for the past three years averaged 291 per pound for copper and 847 per ounce for gold and molybdenum prices for the past three years averaged approximately 23 per pound 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in defining our openpit reserves we apply a “variable cutoff grade” strategy the objective of this strategy is to maximize the net present value of our operations we use a breakeven cutoff grade to define the insitu reserves for our underground ore bodies the breakeven cutoff grade is defined for a metric ton of ore as that equivalent copper grade once produced and sold that generates sufficient revenue to cover all operating and administrative costs associated with our production 

our copper mines may contain other commercially recoverable metals such as gold molybdenum silver and cobalt we value all commercially recoverable metals in terms of a copper equivalent percentage to determine a single cutoff grade copper equivalent percentage is used to express the relative value of multimetal ores in terms of one metal the calculation expresses the relative value of the ore using estimates of contained metal quantities metals prices as used for reserve determination recovery rates treatment charges and royalties our molybdenum properties use a molybdenum cutoff grade the table below shows the minimum cutoff grade by process for each of our existing ore bodies as of december 31 2009 

 

 

drill hole spacing data is used by mining professionals such as geologists and geological engineers in determining the suitability of data coverage on a relative basis in a given deposit type and mining method scenario so as to achieve a given level of confidence in the resource estimate drill hole spacing is only one of several criteria necessary to establish resource classification drilling programs are typically designed to achieve an optimum sample spacing to support the level of confidence in results that apply to a particular stage of development of a mineral deposit the following table sets forth the average drill hole spacing based on average sample distance or drill pattern spacing for proven and probable ore reserves by process type 

 

 

production sequencing 

the following chart illustrates our current plans for sequencing and producing the december 31 2009 proven and probable reserves at each of our ore bodies and the years in which we currently expect production from each ore body the chart also shows the term of pt freeport indonesia’s cow production volumes are typically lower in the first few years for each ore body as development activities are ongoing and as the mine ramps up to full production and production volumes may also be lower as the mine reaches the end of its life the ultimate timing of the start of production from our undeveloped mines is dependent upon a number of factors including the results of our exploration and development efforts and may vary from the dates shown below in addition we develop our mine plans based on maximizing the net present value from the ore bodies significant additional capital expenditures will be required at many of these mines in order to achieve the lifeofmine plans reflected below 

 

mill and leach stockpiles 

mill and leach stockpiles generally contain lowergrade ores that have been extracted from the ore body and are available for copper recovery for mill stockpiles recovery is through milling concentrating smelting and refining or alternatively by concentrate leaching for leach stockpiles recovery is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities 

because it is generally impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count reasonable estimation methods are employed the quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grades of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles 

expected copper recovery rates for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing the recoverable copper in mill stockpiles once entered into the production process can be extracted into copper concentrate almost immediately 

expected copper recovery rates for leach stockpiles are determined using smallscale laboratory tests small to largescale column testing which simulates the productionscale process historical trends and other factors including mineralogy of the ore and rock type ultimate recovery of copper contained in leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low percentage to more than 90 percent depending on several variables including type of copper recovery mineralogy and particle size of the rock for newly placed material on active stockpiles as much as 70 percent of the copper ultimately recoverable may be extracted during the first year and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years 

processes and recovery rates are monitored continuously and recovery rate estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes 

following are our stockpiles and the estimated recoverable copper contained within those stockpiles as of december 31 2009 

 

  

  

mineralized material 

we hold various properties containing mineralized material that we believe could be brought into production should market conditions warrant however permitting and significant capital expenditures would be required before operations could commence at these properties mineralized material is a mineralized body that has been delineated by appropriately spaced drilling andor underground sampling to support the reported tonnage and average metal grades such a deposit may not qualify as recoverable proven and probable reserves until legal and economic feasibility are confirmed based upon a comprehensive evaluation of development costs unit costs grades recoveries and other material factors estimated mineralized materials as presented on the following page were assessed using prices of 200 per pound of copper 750 per ounce of gold and 1200 per pound of molybdenum

financial risks 

extended declines in the market prices of copper gold andor molybdenum could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows and if sustained could adversely affect our ability to repay debt fluctuations in the market prices of copper gold or molybdenum can cause significant volatility in our financial performance and adversely affect the trading prices of our debt and equity securities 

our earnings and cash flows are affected significantly by the market prices of copper and to a lesser extent gold and molybdenum the world market prices of these commodities have fluctuated historically and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control for information about movements in the market prices of these commodities refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – copper gold and molybdenum markets” an extended decline in the market prices of these commodities could 1 adversely affect our earnings and cash flows 2 adversely affect our ability to repay our debt and meet our other fixed obligations and 3 depress the trading prices of our common and preferred stock and of our publicly traded debt securities 

in addition substantially all of our copper concentrate sales and some of our copper cathode sales are provisionally priced at the time of shipment the provisional prices are finalized in a contractually specified future period generally one to four months from the shipment date based primarily on quoted london metal exchange lme prices accordingly in times of falling copper prices our revenues are negatively affected by lower prices received for contracts priced at current market rates and also from a decrease related to the final pricing of provisionally priced sales pursuant to contracts entered into in prior periods in times of rising copper prices the opposite occurs 

there continues to be uncertainty in the global economy which could negatively affect the market prices of commodities including the metals that we produce if market prices for the metals we produce decline for a sustained period of time we may have to revise our operating plans including curtailing production reducing operating costs and capital expenditures and discontinuing certain exploration and development programs we may be unable to decrease our costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues and may incur losses 

world copper prices have historically fluctuated widely during the three years ended december 31 2009 lme daily closing spot prices ranged from 126 to 408 per pound for copper the lme spot copper price closed at 311 per pound on january 29 2010 world copper prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

world gold prices have historically fluctuated widely during the three years ended december 31 2009 the daily closing prices on the london spot market ranged from 608 to 1213 per ounce for gold london gold prices closed at 1079 per ounce on january 29 2010 world gold prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

molybdenum prices also fluctuate widely molybdenum demand depends primarily on the global steel industry which uses the metal as a hardening and corrosion inhibiting agent approximately 80 percent of molybdenum production is used in this application the remainder is used in specialty chemical applications such as catalysts water treatment agents and lubricants approximately 50 percent of global molybdenum production is a byproduct of copper mining which is relatively insensitive to molybdenum prices during the three years ended december 31 2009 the metals week dealer oxide weekly average price for molybdenum ranged from 783 to 3388 per pound the metals week molybdenum dealer oxide weekly average price was 1488 per pound on january 29 2010 molybdenum prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the agreements governing our indebtedness require us to meet certain financial tests and other covenants and as a result may limit our flexibility in the operation of our business and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 

we incurred significant debt to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid to acquire phelps dodge corporation phelps dodge as of december 31 2009 the outstanding principal amount of our indebtedness was 63 billion the agreements governing our indebtedness restrict subject to certain exceptions our ability to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in april 2008 standard  poor’s rating services sp and fitch ratings raised our corporate credit rating and the ratings on our unsecured debt to bbb investment grade as a result of the upgrade of our unsecured debt to investment grade by sp the restrictions contained in our 8375 825 and floating rate senior notes on incurring debt making restricted payments and selling assets were suspended 

in addition our senior revolving credit facilities require that we meet certain financial tests at any time that borrowings are outstanding under these facilities including a leverage ratio test total debt to consolidated ebitda as those terms are defined in the facility for the preceding four quarters cannot exceed 50 to 10 on the last day of any fiscal quarter and a secured leverage ratio test total secured debt to consolidated ebitda as those terms are defined in the facility for the preceding four quarters cannot exceed 30 to 10 on the last day of any fiscal quarter during periods in which copper gold or molybdenum prices or production volumes or other conditions reflect the adverse impact of cyclical market trends or other factors we may not be able to comply with the applicable financial covenants 

our senior revolving credit facilities and our 8375 825 and floating rate senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability to make certain payments these restrictions vary among the instruments but generally limit our ability to pay certain dividends on common and preferred stock repurchase or redeem common and preferred equity prepay subordinated debt and make certain investments to the extent the rating is downgraded below investment grade these covenants in our 8375 825 and floating rate senior notes would again become effective at december 31 2009 the most restrictive of these covenants related to restricted payments allowed for payments up to approximately 76 billion 

our obligations under our senior credit facilities are 1 guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries and 2 secured by a pledge of a 100 percent of the equity in substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries and b 665 percent of the equity in substantially all of our first tier foreign subsidiaries 

any failure to comply with the restrictions of our senior credit facilities senior notes or any agreement governing our other indebtedness after giving effect to any applicable grace period may result in an event of default such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt which may trigger crossacceleration or crossdefault provisions in other debt agreements we would not be able to fully repay when due borrowings under our debt instruments that are accelerated upon an event of default 

  

if we are unable to repay refinance or restructure our indebtedness under or amend the covenants contained in our senior credit agreements at maturity or in the event of a default the lenders under our senior credit facilities could terminate their commitments thereunder cease making further loans declare all borrowings outstanding together with accrued interest and other fees immediately due and payable and institute foreclosure proceedings against the collateral any such actions could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

under us federal and state laws that require closure and reclamation plans for our mines we are required to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement those plans if we are unable to do so the us environmental protection agency epa and state agencies may seek financial assurance for investigation and remediation actions taken under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or equivalent state regulations the failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

we are required by us federal and state laws to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans if we are unable to do so these laws are complex and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction the laws govern the determination of the scope and cost of the closure and reclamation obligations and the amount and forms of financial assurance 

 

in july 2009 epa published a priority notice of action identifying classes of facilities within the hardrock mining industry for which the agency will develop financial responsibility requirements it is uncertain how the new requirements will affect the amount and form of our existing and future financial assurance obligations 

 

as of december 31 2009 our financial assurance obligations associated with closure and reclamation costs totaled approximately 710 million of which approximately 414 million was in the form of parent company guarantees and financial capability demonstrations our ability to continue to provide financial assurance in the form of parent guarantees and financial capability demonstrations in new mexico and arizona depends on our ability to meet financial tests certain of the ratios in these tests are significantly more rigorous for companies that do not have an investment grade rating from a stateapproved ratings service we are currently rated investment grade by standard  poor’s and fitch but are not rated investment grade by moody’s if we fail to maintain our investment grade rating we would be subject to these alternate tests in which case the regulatory agencies may require us to provide alternative forms of financial assurance to fully satisfy our financial assurance obligations such as letters of credit surety bonds or collateral depending on our financial condition and market conditions these other forms of financial assurance may be difficult or costly to provide issuance of letters of credit under our credit facilities would reduce our available liquidity failure to provide the required financial assurance could result in the closure of mines as of december 31 2009 we have limited financial assurance obligations associated with cerclarelated actions although epa and certain states are currently considering increasing the use of financial assurance requirements   for additional information see the risk factor “mine closure regulations impose substantial costs on our operations” below 

 

we need significant amounts of cash to service our debt if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to service our debt our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected 

as of december 31 2009 the outstanding principal amount of our debt was 63 billion we must generate sufficient amounts of cash to service and repay our debt our ability to generate cash will be affected by general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control future borrowings may not be available to us under our senior credit facilities or from the capital markets in amounts sufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund other liquidity needs in addition disruptions in the credit and financial markets such as those beginning in late 2008 can constrain our access to capital and increase its cost the inability to service repay or refinance our indebtedness could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

if future financing is not available to us when required as a result of limited access to the credit markets or otherwise or is not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to invest needed capital for our development and exploration programs take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures any of which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

  

movements in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates could negatively affect our operating results 

substantially all of our revenues and a significant portion of our costs are denominated in us dollars however some costs and certain asset and liability accounts are denominated in local currencies including the indonesian rupiah australian dollar chilean peso peruvian nuevos sol and euro as a result our results are adversely affected when the us dollar weakens in relation to those foreign currencies 

at december 31 2009 approximately 19 percent of our outstanding debt was subject to variable interest rates increases in these rates will increase our interest costs and reduce our profits and operating cash flows 

from time to time we may implement currency or interest rate hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange or interest rates however our hedging strategies may not be successful and any of our unhedged foreign exchange or interest payments will continue to be subject to market fluctuations 

operational risks 

the volume and grade of ore reserves that we recover and our rate of production may be more or less than anticipated 

our ore reserve amounts are determined in accordance with established mining industry practices and standards and are estimates of the mineral deposits that can be recovered economically and legally based on currently available data estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves are subject to considerable uncertainty ore bodies may not conform to standard geological expectations and estimates may change as new data becomes available because ore bodies do not contain uniform grades and types of minerals our metal recovery rates will vary from time to time 

additionally because the determination of reserves is based partially on estimates of future selling prices a sustained decrease in such prices may result in a reduction in economically recoverable ore reserves these factors may result in variations in the volumes of mineral reserves that we report from period to period 

there are also uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of ore reserves and copper recovered from stockpiles the quantity of copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records the volume and grade of ore reserves recovered rates of production and recovered copper from stockpiles may be less than anticipated 

we must continually replace reserves depleted by production our exploration activities may not result in additional discoveries 

our ability to replenish our ore reserves is important to our longterm viability produced ore reserves must be replaced by further delineation of existing ore bodies or by locating new deposits in order to maintain production levels over the long term openpit operations at grasberg are expected to continue through mid 2016 at which time underground mining operations are scheduled to begin at our grasberg block cave mine which is under development production at the doz mine is expected to continue through 2020 and we plan to ramp up production at our deep mill level zone dmlz block cave mine which is currently under development beginning in 2015 in addition oxide copper production at el abra is expected to decline over the next several years and production from the sulfide ore is expected to begin in 2012 

exploration is highly speculative in nature our exploration projects involve many risks require substantial expenditures and may not result in the discovery of sufficient additional mineral deposits that can be mined profitably once a site with mineralization is discovered it may take several years from the initial phases of drilling until production is possible during which time the economic feasibility of production may change substantial expenditures are required to establish recoverable proven and probable reserves and to construct mining and processing facilities as a result there is no assurance that current or future exploration programs will be successful there is a risk that depletion of reserves will not be offset by discoveries or acquisitions 

  

development projects are inherently risky and may require more capital than anticipated which could adversely affect our business 

there are many risks and uncertainties inherent in all development projects including our significant future development of underground mines at the grasberg minerals district and our development of a large sulfide deposit at el abra the economic feasibility of development projects is based on many factors including the accuracy of estimated reserves metallurgical recoveries capital and operating costs and future prices of the relevant minerals the capital expenditures and time required to develop new mines or other projects are considerable and changes in costs or construction schedules can affect project economics moreover underground mining is generally more expensive than surface mining as a result of higher capital costs including costs for modern mining equipment and construction of extensive ventilation systems thus it is possible that actual costs and economic returns may differ materially from our estimates 

new development projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future cash flow these development projects also require the successful completion of feasibility studies acquisition of governmental permits acquisition of land power and water and ensuring that appropriate community infrastructure is developed by third parties to support such projects it is possible that we could fail to obtain the government approvals necessary for the operation of a project in which case the project may not proceed either on its original timing or at all it is not unusual for new mining operations to experience unexpected problems during the startup phase resulting in delays in producing revenue and increases in invested capital 

the development of underground mines is subject to additional risks including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some of these risks could result in a delay to production startup and a loss or reduction in minable tons there can be no assurance that the occurrence of such events or conditions would not have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

our business is subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our business 

mines by their nature are subject to many operational risks some of which are outside of our control these operational risks which could adversely affect our business operating results and cash flows include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the failure to adequately manage some of these risks could result in significant personal injury loss of life property damage and damage to the environment both on and outside our operating sites as well as damage to production facilities and delays in production 

continuation of our mining production is dependent on the availability of a sufficient water supply to support our mining operations 

our mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining ore processing and related support facilities our operations in north and south america are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant continuous production at our mines is dependent on our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and defeat claims adverse to our current water uses in legal proceedings at our us operations under state law our water rights give us only the right to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location in arizona we are a participant in two active general stream adjudications in which for over 30 years the state of arizona has been attempting to quantify and prioritize surface water claims in two of the state’s largest river systems that affect four of our operating mines morenci sierrita miami and safford these legal proceedings may also affect our arizona mine at bagdad groundwater is not subject to adjudication in arizona but is subject to the doctrine of reasonable use which requires balancing the utility of the use against the gravity of the harm to others who have rights in the same aquifer however wells may be subject to adjudication to the extent they are found to produce or affect surface water in colorado our surface water and groundwater rights are subject to adjudication and we are involved in legal proceedings to resolve disputes regarding priority of administration of rights including priority of some of our rights for the climax mine our surface water and groundwater rights are fully licensed or have been fully adjudicated in new mexico 

in south america water for our mining operations at candelaria and ojos del salado is drawn from the copiapó river aquifer because of rapid depletion of this aquifer in recent years ongoing studies are assessing the available supply for our mining operations at these sites due to anticipated shortages in this water resource plans are in place to develop new supplementary water supplies construction is under way to convey treated effluent from a nearby sewage treatment plant to the mine and permitting has begun to construct both a desalination plant near the pacific ocean to treat seawater and a pipeline to convey the desalinated water to the candelaria mine 

water for our el abra mining operations in chile comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascotán pursuant to regulatory approval at el abra hydrogeologic studies are ongoing to obtain regulatory approval for the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascotán to process sulfide ore we expect that the amount of water needed to develop the sulfide ore project will represent a significant increase over current volumes used in processing the oxide ore el abra is working closely with regulatory authorities to meet these requirements failure to obtain the necessary regulatory approval or receipt of approval in a less than desired amount could adversely affect our development of the sulfide ore project as planned 

 

 

water for our cerro verde mining operations in peru comes from a series of storage reservoirs on the rio chili watershed that collect water primarily from seasonal precipitation our cerro verde mining operations recently constructed several new water reservoirs on the rio chili watershed to obtain more water rights and to expand storage capacity due to occasional drought and possible effects of climate change reducing precipitation levels temporary supply shortages are possible that could affect our operations as currently planned 

although each operation currently has sufficient water rights and claims to cover its operational demands we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings on our water rights claims and uses the loss of some or all water rights for any of our mines in whole or in part or shortages of water to which we have rights could require us to curtail or shut down mining production and could prevent us from pursuing expansion opportunities 

an interruption of energy supply could adversely affect our mining operations 

our mining operations and development projects require significant amounts of energy our principal energy sources are electricity purchased petroleum products natural gas and coal our south america mining operations receive electrical power under longterm contracts with local energy companies our africa mining operation has entered into longterm power supply and infrastructure funding agreements with the stateowned electric utility company serving the katanga province of the democratic republic of congo drc a disruption in the transmission of energy inadequate energy transmission infrastructure or the termination of any of our energy supply contracts could interrupt our energy supply and adversely affect our operations 

increased production costs could reduce our profitability and cash flow 

energy represents a significant portion of our production costs an inability to procure sufficient energy at reasonable prices could adversely affect our profits cash flow and growth opportunities our production costs are also affected by the prices of commodities we consume or use in our operations such as sulphuric acid grinding media steel reagents liners explosives and diluents the prices of such commodities are influenced by supply and demand trends affecting the mining industry in general and other factors outside our control and such prices are at times subject to volatile movements increases in the cost of these commodities could make our operations less profitable increases in the costs of commodities that we consume or use may also significantly affect the capital costs of new projects 

in addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry our indonesia operations involve additional risks because they are located on unusually difficult terrain in a very remote area 

our grasberg mining operations are located in steep mountainous terrain in a very remote area in indonesia because of these conditions we have had to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities in addition the area receives considerable rainfall which has led to periodic floods and mudslides the mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time our insurance may not sufficiently cover an unexpected natural or operating disaster 

on october 9 2003 a slippage of material occurred in a section of the grasberg open pit resulting in eight fatalities on december 12 2003 a debris flow involving a relatively small amount of loose material occurred in the same section of the open pit resulting in only minor property damage the events caused us to alter our shortterm mine sequencing plans which adversely affected our 2003 and 2004 production we resumed normal production activities in the second quarter of 2004 

on march 23 2006 a mudtopsoil slide involving approximately 75000 metric tons of material occurred from a mountain ridge above service facilities supporting pt freeport indonesia’s mining facilities three contract workers were fatally injured in the event the material damaged a mess hall and an adjacent area as a result of investigations by pt freeport indonesia and the indonesian department of energy and mineral resources we conducted geotechnical studies to identify and address any potential hazards to workers and facilities from slides the existing early warning system for potential slides based upon rainfall and other factors has also been expanded 

 

on september 10 2008 a small scale failure encompassing approximately 75000 metric tons of material occurred at our grasberg open pit there were no injuries or property damage the event caused a delay in our access to the highgrade section of the open pit and as a result a portion of the metal expected to be mined in the second half of 2008 was deferred to future periods 

no assurance can be given that similar events will not occur in the future 

our africa mining operation tenke fungurume involves additional risks because it is located in a remote area of the drc 

our africa mining operation is located in a remote area of the drc and is subject to additional challenges including 

 

 

 

 

 

for example due to limited rail access we currently truck a significant portion of the production from our africa mining operation approximately 1900 miles to ports in south africa our africa mining operation and future development may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control which could adversely affect their contribution to our operating results and increase the cost of future development 

environmental risks 

our domestic and international operations are subject to complex and evolving environmental laws and regulations and compliance with environmental and regulatory requirements involves significant costs 

our ongoing mining operations and exploration activities both in the us and elsewhere are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing exploration development production occupational health mine safety toxic substances waste disposal protection and remediation of the environment protection of endangered and protected species and other related matters compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs and we expect these costs to continue to increase in the future because of increased regulatory enforcement increased demand for remediation services and shortages of equipment supplies labor and other factors the federal clean air act has had a significant impact particularly on our domestic smelter and power plants any change in waste management regulation of the mining industry under the federal resource conservation and recovery act could have a significant impact both on operational compliance and closure costs in addition environmental laws and regulations may change in ways that could substantially increase compliance costs or adversely affect our operations or expansion opportunities 

in addition to compliance with environmental regulation at our operating sites we incur significant costs for remediating environmental conditions on properties that have not been operated in many years 

freeportmcmoran corporation fmc formerly phelps dodge corporation and many of its affiliates and predecessor companies have been involved in mining milling and manufacturing in the us for more than a century activities that occurred in the late 19th century and the 20th century prior to the advent of modern environmental laws were not subject to environmental regulation and were conducted before american industrial companies understood the longterm effects of their operations on the surrounding environment with the passage of cercla in 1980 companies like phelps dodge became legally responsible for environmental remediation on properties previously owned or operated by them irrespective of when the damage to the environment occurred or who caused it that liability is often shared on a joint and several basis with all other 

  

  

owners and operators meaning that each owner or operator of the property is fully responsible for the cleanup although in many cases some or all of the other historical owners or operators no longer exist do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found as a result because of our acquisition of phelps dodge in 2007 many of the subsidiary companies we now own are responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the us and we expect to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address these remediation issues we are also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources as of december 31 2009 we had more than 100 active remediation projects in the us in approximately 25 states 

we incurred aggregate environmental capital expenditure and other environmental costs including our joint venture partners’ shares to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect our operations of 289 million in 2009 377 million in 2008 and 280 million in 2007 for 2010 we expect to incur approximately 426 million of aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs which are part of our overall 2010 operating budget 

at december 31 2009 15 billion of environmental obligations were recorded in our consolidated balance sheet our environmental obligation estimates are based upon 1 our knowledge and beliefs about complex scientific and historical facts and circumstances that in many cases involve events that occurred many decades ago 2 our beliefs and assumptions regarding the nature extent and duration of remediation activities that we will be required to undertake the estimated costs of those activities which are subject to varying interpretations and 3 our beliefs regarding the requirements that are imposed on us by existing laws and regulations and in some cases the expected clarification of uncertain regulatory requirements that could materially affect our environmental obligation estimates significant adjustments to these estimates are likely to occur in the future as additional information becomes available the actual environmental costs ultimately may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs and any such changes could be material refer to note 14 for more information on our environmental obligations 

an adverse ruling in one or more pending legal proceedings involving environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on us 

as described in our securities and exchange commission sec filings we are a defendant in numerous and in some cases significant litigation involving environmental cleanup costs alleged environmental toxic torts and interpretations of environmental regulations an adverse ruling in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

 

mine closure regulations impose substantial costs on our operations 

 

our domestic operations are subject to various federal and state permitting requirements that include mine closure and minedland reclamation obligations these requirements are complex and vary depending upon the jurisdiction the laws govern the determination of the scope and cost of the closure and reclamation obligations and the amount and forms of financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to meet the obligations of those plans if we are unable to do so in general our domestic mines are required to review estimated closure and reclamation costs on either a periodic basis or at the time of significant permit modifications and post increasing amounts of financial assurance as required 

 

in addition our international mines are subject to various mine closure and minedland reclamation laws and there have recently been significant changes in closure and reclamation programs in both peru and chile that impose more stringent obligations on us for closure and reclamation updated closure plans for our three chilean operations were submitted to the government in february 2009 and the peruvian government approved cerro verde’s closure plan in october 2009 

 

our asset retirement obligations aros determined as required by generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the us totaled 731 million including approximately 46 million for the current portion at december 31 2009 at december 31 2009 we had accrued reclamation and closure costs of 351 million for our new mexico operations 187 million for our arizona operations and 102 million for pt freeport indonesia aro cost estimates may increase or decrease significantly in the future as a result of changes in regulations engineering designs and technology permit modifications or updates mine plans cost of inflation or other factors and as actual reclamation spending occurs 

 

  

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change issues may increase our costs and adversely affect our operations and markets 

many scientists believe that emissions from the combustion of carbonbased fuels contribute to greenhouse effects and therefore potentially to climate change in 2009 our worldwide total greenhouse gas emissions measured as carbon dioxide equivalent emissions were 89 million metric tons nearly equally divided between direct and indirect emissions most of our direct emissions are from fuel combustion in haul trucks followed by the combustion of fuels to provide energy for roasting smelting and other processes indirect emissions are generally the emissions of outside providers from whom we purchase electricity for use in our operations approximately 19 percent of our direct emissions are in north america and 68 percent in indonesia and approximately 60 percent of our indirect emissions are in north america and 38 percent in south america 

a number of governments have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes regarding greenhouse gas emissions for example in the us the epa issued final regulations in september 2009 requiring mandatory monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions in specified circumstances commencing in 2010 our morenci mine miami smelter and el paso refinery will likely be required to report their emissions under this program in december 2009 the epa issued findings under the clean air act that the current and projected concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten public health and welfare while the findings themselves do not impose any requirements they form the basis for future regulation of our greenhouse gas emissions in the us in june 2009 the us house of representatives passed the american clean energy and security act of 2009 aces also known as the waxmanmarkey bill which proposes to impose a “cap and trade” program aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions several states have also initiated action on their own or as part of regional organizations such as the western climate initiative to limit emissions of greenhouse gases the us may also become a party to international agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions which could lead to new regulations affecting our us operations the december 1997 kyoto protocol established a set of greenhouse gas emission targets for developed countries that have ratified the protocol although the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 has not been ratified by the us the us continues to participate in global climate summits that may lead to an agreement in the future 

we actively pursue ways to improve the energy efficiency of our operations and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in 2009 we formed a multidepartmental task force to focus our efforts on these topics in addition since 2006 we have participated in the carbon disclosure project which is a voluntary initiative that promotes standardized reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and reduction efforts from a medium and longterm perspective we are likely to see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit significant amounts of greenhouse gases as a result of regulatory initiatives in the us and other countries in which we operate in addition the cost of electricity that we purchase from others may increase if they incur increased costs from the regulation of their greenhouse gas emissions we cannot predict the magnitude of any increased costs at this time given the wide scope of potential regulatory changes in the many countries in which we operate 

the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would be particular to the geographic circumstances these may include changes in rainfall patterns water shortages changing sea levels changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperatures these effects may adversely impact the cost production and financial performance of our operations 

our operating inactive and historical us mining sites and facilities may be subject to future regulation of radioactive materials that are commonly associated with or result from our mining operations 

a number of federal and state agencies are considering new regulations to characterize regulate and remediate potential workplace exposures and environmental impacts of radioactive materials commonly associated with mining operations for example the epa could promulgate rules to regulate technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive materials tenorm and their impacts at mining operations in addition several states are promulgating groundwater quality compliance and remediation standards for radioactive materials including uranium radioactive materials can be associated with copper mineral deposits including both our current and discontinued operations consequently our copper operations may generate concentrate or release radioactive materials that may subject our operations to new and increased regulation the impact of such future regulation on our operating closure reclamation and remediation costs is uncertain 

 

our indonesia mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges and future changes in environmental laws or unanticipated environmental impacts from those operations could require us to incur increased costs 

mining operations on the scale of our operations in papua involve significant environmental risks and challenges our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of crushed and ground rock material called tailings that results from the process by which we physically separate the copper gold and silverbearing materials from the ore that we mine our tailings management plan which has been approved by the government of indonesia uses the river system near our mine to transport the tailings to an engineered area in the lowlands where the tailings and natural sediments are managed in a deposition area lateral levees have been engineered and constructed to limit and help contain the footprint of tailings impact in the lowlands 

another major environmental challenge is managing overburden which is the rock that must be moved aside in the mining process in order to reach the ore in the presence of air water and naturally occurring bacteria some overburden can generate acid rock drainage or acidic water containing dissolved metals which if not properly managed can have a negative impact on the environment 

certain indonesian governmental officials have from time to time raised questions with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans including a suggestion that we implement a pipeline system rather than our river transport system for tailings management and disposition because our mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area a pipeline system would be costly difficult to construct and maintain and more prone to catastrophic failure and could therefore involve significant potentially adverse environmental issues based on our own studies and others conducted by third parties we do not believe that a pipeline system is necessary or practical 

in connection with obtaining our environmental approvals from the indonesian government we committed to perform a onetime environmental risk assessment on the impacts of our tailings management plan we completed this extensive environmental risk assessment with more than 90 scientific studies conducted over four years and submitted it to the indonesian government in december 2002 we developed the risk assessment study using internationally recognized methods with input from an independent review panel which included representatives from the indonesian government academia and nongovernmental organizations the risks identified during this process were in line with our impact projections of the tailings management program contained in our environmental approval documents 

since 2005 pt freeport indonesia has participated in the government of indonesia’s proper program for pollution control evaluation and rating program in october 2009 the indonesian ministry of environment announced the latest results of its proper environmental management audit and gave pt freeport indonesia a blue rating acknowledging pt freeport indonesia’s environmental management practices as being in compliance with the laws and regulations in indonesia and also making several recommendations for improvement 

international risks 

our international operations are subject to political social and geographic risks of doing business in foreign countries 

we are a global mining company with substantial assets located outside of the us we conduct international mining operations in indonesia peru chile and the democratic republic of congo accordingly our business may be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties in each of these countries in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in foreign countries such risks include 1 renegotiation cancellation or forced modification of existing contracts 2 expropriation or nationalization of property 3 changes in a foreign country’s laws regulations and policies including those relating to labor taxation royalties divestment imports exports trade regulations currency and environmental matters 4 political instability bribery extortion corruption civil strife acts of war guerilla activities insurrection and terrorism 5 foreign exchange controls and 6 the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel or having to enforce the judgment of a foreign court or arbitration panel against a sovereign nation within its own territory our insurance does not cover most losses caused by these risks consequently our exploration development and production activities outside of the us could be substantially affected by factors beyond our control some of which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 

  

in december 2009 pt freeport indonesia was notified by the large taxpayer’s office of the government of indonesia that pt freeport indonesia is obligated to pay value added taxes on certain goods imported after the year 2000 the amount of taxes and penalties would be significant pt freeport indonesia believes that pursuant to the terms of its contract of work it is only required to pay value added taxes on these types of goods imported after december 30 2009 pt freeport indonesia is working cooperatively with the applicable government authorities to resolve this matter 

 

in december 2008 our cerro verde mining operation in peru was notified by peruvian revenue authorities of their intent to assess mining royalties related to minerals processed by the cerro verde concentrator in august 2009 cerro verde received a formal assessment in the amount of approximately 50 million in connection with its alleged obligations for mining royalties and fines for the period from october 2006 to december 2007 cerro verde is challenging this assessment as it believes that royalty obligations with respect to all minerals extracted are governed by its existing stability agreement regardless of the processing method applied after extraction and believes that it owes no royalties with respect to minerals processed through its concentrator we are working cooperatively with the peruvian authorities to resolve this matter 

because our grasberg minerals district in papua indonesia remains our most significant operating asset our business may continue to be adversely affected by indonesian political economic and social uncertainties 

indonesia has faced political economic and social uncertainties including separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces in particular several separatist groups are opposing indonesian rule over the province of papua where our grasberg minerals district is located and have sought political independence for the province in response indonesia enacted regional autonomy laws which became effective january 1 2001 the manner in which the new laws are being implemented and the degree of political and economic autonomy that they may bring to individual provinces including papua are uncertain and are ongoing issues in indonesian politics in papua there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the indonesian military social economic and political instability in papua could materially and adversely affect us if it results in damage to our property or interruption of our activities 

maintaining a good working relationship with the indonesian government is important to us because our mining operations there are among indonesia’s most significant business enterprises and are conducted pursuant to a contract of work with the indonesian government partially because of their significance to indonesia’s economy the environmentally sensitive area in which they are located and the number of people employed our operations are occasionally the subject of criticism in the indonesian press and in political debates and have been the target of protests and occasional violence 

since july 2009 there has been a series of shooting incidents along the road leading to our mining and milling operations at our grasberg mining complex including an incident in january 2010 in connection with these incidents there have been three fatalities including one pt freeport indonesia employee a security contractor and an indonesian policeman and several injuries the indonesian government has responded with additional security forces and has expressed a strong commitment to protect the safety of the community and of our operations the investigation of these matters is continuing and we have taken precautionary measures including limiting use of the road to secured convoys our mining and milling activities have continued uninterrupted however prolonged limitations on access to the road could adversely affect operations at the mine in response to these events pt freeport indonesia is currently reviewing security plans with the indonesian authorities 

grasberg operated at reduced mining and milling rates during a fourday period from april 18 2007 to april 21 2007 as a result of peaceful protests by certain workers regarding benefits the protests ended on april 21 with an agreement on a framework for minimum wages for its workers and grasberg returned to normal operations the impacts to production were not significant illegal miners have continued to operate along the river designated to transport the tailings from the mill to the lowlands in pt freeport indonesia’s governmentapproved tailings management area the illegal miners who have trespassed from time to time in the area of our facilities have clashed with police who have attempted to move them away from our facilities in 2006 the illegal miners temporarily blocked the road leading to the grasberg mine and mill in protest and pt freeport indonesia temporarily suspended mining and milling operations as a precautionary measure 

 

 

we cannot predict whether additional incidents will occur that could disrupt our indonesian operations or whether similar incidents may occur in other countries that could affect our other operations if additional protests or other disruptive incidents occur at any of our facilities they could adversely affect our business and profitability in ways that we cannot predict at this time 

we do not expect to mine all of our indonesian ore reserves before the initial term of our contract of work in indonesia expires 

all of our indonesian proven and probable ore reserves including the grasberg deposit are located in block a the initial term of our contract of work covering these ore reserves expires at the end of 2021 we can extend this term for two successive 10year periods subject to the approval of the indonesian government which under our contract of work cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably our ore reserves reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041 ie through the expiration of the two 10year extensions and our current mine plan has been developed and our operations are based on the assumption that we will receive the two 10year extensions as a result we will not mine all of these ore reserves during the current term of our contract of work and there can be no assurance that the indonesian government will approve the extensions prior to the end of 2021 we expect to mine approximately 33 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable ore at december 31 2009 representing approximately 39 percent of pt freeport indonesia’s share of recoverable copper reserves and approximately 52 percent of its share of recoverable gold reserves 

in 2008 indonesia enacted a new mining law which will operate under a licensing system as opposed to the contract of work system that applies to pt freeport indonesia in 2010 the government of indonesia promulgated regulations under the 2008 mining law and certain provisions address existing contracts of work the regulations provide that contracts of work will continue to be honored until their expiration however the regulations attempt to apply certain provisions of the new law to any extension periods of contracts of work even though our contract of work provides for two tenyear extension periods under the existing terms of the contract of work 

 

our contracts of work in indonesia are subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations and if a dispute arises we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel 

pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work and other contracts of work in which we have an interest were entered into under indonesia’s 1967 foreign capital investment law which provides guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization our contracts of work can be terminated by the government of indonesia if we do not satisfy our contractual obligations which include the payment of royalties and taxes to the government and the satisfaction of certain mining environmental safety and health requirements 

certain forestry laws and designations as well as prevailing environmental laws and regulations may conflict with or overlap with the mining rights established under our contract of work although our contract of work grants to pt freeport indonesia the unencumbered right to operate in accordance with the contract of work certain government agencies could seek to impose additional restrictions on pt freeport indonesia that could affect exploration and operating requirements 

at times certain government officials and others in indonesia have questioned the validity of contracts entered into by the government of indonesia prior to may 1998 ie during the suharto regime which lasted over 30 years including pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work which was signed in december 1991 we cannot assure you that the validity of or our compliance with the contracts of work will not be challenged for political or other reasons pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work and our other contracts of work require that disputes with the indonesian government be submitted to international arbitration consequently if a dispute arises under the contracts of work we face the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel and if we prevail in such a dispute we will face the additional risk of having to enforce the judgment of a foreign court or arbitration panel against indonesia within its own territory 

indonesian government officials have periodically undertaken reviews regarding our compliance with indonesian environmental laws and regulations and the terms of the contracts of work in 2006 the government of indonesia created a joint team for “periodic evaluation on implementation of the ptfi contract of work cow” to conduct an evaluation every five years the team consists of five working groups whose members are from relevant ministries or agencies covering production state revenues community development environmental 

  

  

issues and security issues we have conducted numerous meetings with these groups the joint team has indicated that it will issue a report while we believe that we comply with pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work in all material respects we cannot assure you that the report will support that conclusion separately the indonesian house of representatives created a working committee on pt freeport indonesia members of this group have also visited our operations and held a number of hearings in jakarta we will continue to work with these groups to respond to their questions about our operations and our compliance with pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work 

any suspension of required activities under our contracts of work requires the consent of the indonesian government 

our contracts of work permit us to suspend certain contractually required activities including exploration for a period of one year by making a written request to the indonesian government these requests are subject to the approval of the indonesian government and are renewable annually if we do not request a suspension or are denied a suspension then we are required to continue our activities under the contract of work or potentially be declared in default moreover if a suspension continues for more than one year for reasons other than force majeure and the indonesian government has not approved such continuation then the government would be entitled to declare a default under the contract of work 

we suspended our field exploration activities outside of block a in recent years because of safety and security issues and regulatory uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest areas and an indonesian forestry law enacted in 1999 prohibiting openpit mining in forest preservation areas in 2001 we requested and received from the government of indonesia formal temporary suspensions of our obligations under the contracts of work in all areas outside of block a recent indonesian legislation permits openpit mining in pt freeport indonesia’s block b area subject to certain requirements following an assessment of these requirements and a review of security issues in 2007 we resumed exploration activities in certain prospective contract of work areas outside of block a 

our tenke fungurume mining operation is located in the katanga province of the drc and may be adversely affected by political economic and social instability in the drc 

during 2009 we completed construction activities for the initial tenke fungurume development project which is located in the drc since 1960 the drc has undergone outbreaks of violence changes in national leadership and financial crisis these factors heighten the risk of abrupt changes in the national policy towards foreign investors which in turn could result in unilateral modification of concessions or contracts increased taxation denial of permits or permit renewals or expropriation of assets our ability to continue mining operations and future development is currently subject to an ongoing review of our mining convention which was part of a review of all mining contracts by the ministry of mines ministry in the drc the outcome of which cannot be predicted we received notification on february 20 2008 that the ministry wishes to renegotiate several material provisions of our mining concessions we believe that the terms of the concessions are fair and that they were negotiated transparently and are legally binding however we cannot predict whether the government of the drc will respect our contract rights 

in july 2009 tenke fungurume was advised that the minister of justice in the drc authorized an inquiry regarding the alleged misappropriation of public funds in connection with the securing of labor and immigration authorizations and the payment of associated fees for the tenke fungurume project several government officials and three tenke fungurume employees were arrested in october 2009 the three tenke fungurume employees were tried and acquitted one government official the head of immigration in the katanga province was sentenced to five years imprisonment on charges of embezzlement the office of the attorney general of the drc has filed a notice of appeal of the judgment the implications of which are not yet clear 

in july 2009 tenke fungurume entered into a settlement agreement with drc tax authorities in connection with an administrative audit regarding the payment of fees for work permits and visas for its foreign workers and subcontractors including shortterm workers pursuant to the agreement which covers the period from january 2007 to the date of the settlement tenke fungurume paid approximately 16 million in fees and penalties the procedures associated with obtaining labor and immigration authorizations for shortterm workers on a timely basis are not clearly established in the drc and tenke fungurume continues to work proactively and cooperatively with the tax authorities to establish approved procedures for doing so consistent with its mining convention and local law 

  

other political economic and social risks that are generally outside of our control and could adversely affect our business include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequently our tenke fungurume mining operations and future development projects may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control any of which could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 

terrorist attacks and violence near our operations and throughout the world and the potential for additional future terrorist acts and violence have created economic and political uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business 

on july 17 2009 two suicide bombers set off explosions inside of the jw marriott and ritzcarlton hotels in jakarta indonesia that are reported to have killed nine people and injured 53 others two of our indonesianbased executives were injured in the incident 

on july 8 2009 a small group of individuals created a disturbance on the road leading to our mining and milling operations at our grasberg mining complex and vandalized vehicles and small buildings there were no injuries for more information about a series of shooting incidents near our grasberg mining complex see the risk factor “because our grasberg minerals district in papua indonesia remains our most significant operating asset our business may continue to be adversely affected by indonesian political economic and social uncertainties” above 

on august 31 2002 three people were killed and 11 others were wounded in an ambush by a group of unidentified assailants on the road near tembagapura the mining town where the majority of pt freeport indonesia’s personnel reside the assailants shot at several vehicles transporting international contract teachers from our school in tembagapura their family members and other contractors to pt freeport indonesia the us federal bureau of investigation fbi investigated the incident which resulted in the us indictment of an alleged operational commander of the free papua movementnational freedom force in january 2006 indonesian police accompanied by fbi agents arrested the alleged operational commander and 11 other papuans in november 2006 verdicts and sentencing were announced for seven of those accused in the august 2002 shooting including a life sentence for the confessed leader of the attack 

on october 12 2002 a bombing killed 202 people in the indonesian province of bali which is 1500 miles west of our mining and milling operations indonesian authorities arrested 35 people in connection with this bombing and 29 of those arrested have been tried and convicted on august 5 2003 12 people were killed and over 100 were injured by a car bomb detonated outside of the jw marriott hotel in jakarta indonesia on september 9 2004 11 people were killed and over 200 injured by a car bomb detonated in front of the australian embassy in jakarta on october 1 2005 three suicide bombers killed 19 people and wounded over 100 in bali the same international terrorist organizations are suspected in each of these incidents in november 2005 indonesian police raided a house in east java that resulted in the death of other accused terrorists linked to the bombings discussed above our mining and milling operations were not interrupted by these incidents but pt freeport indonesia’s corporate office in jakarta had to relocate for several months following the bombing in front of the australian embassy in addition to the bali jw marriott hotel and australian embassy bombings there have been antiamerican demonstrations in certain sections of indonesia reportedly led by radical islamic activists 

  

no assurance can be given that additional terrorist incidents and acts of violence will not occur if there were to be additional violence it could materially and adversely affect our business in ways that we cannot predict at this time 

other risks 

if market prices for our commodities decline the carrying values of inventories and longlived assets may be further impaired which could require charges to operating income that could be material 

during fourthquarter 2008 we concluded that the thencurrent economic environment and significant declines in copper and molybdenum prices represented significant adverse changes in our business requiring us to evaluate our longlived assets and goodwill for impairment as a result we recorded impairment charges totaling 169 billion 126 billion to net loss attributable to fcx common stockholders additionally the declines in copper and molybdenum prices in late 2008 resulted in lower of cost or market lcm inventory charges totaling 782 million 479 million to net loss attributable to fcx common stockholders in 2008 additional lcm charges associated with molybdenum inventories totaling 19 million 15 million to net income attributable to fcx common stockholders were recorded in firstquarter 2009 declines in the market price of copper among other factors may cause us to record additional lcm inventory adjustments and may also require us to further write down the carrying value of longlived assets which would potentially have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and stockholders equity but would have no effect on cash flows 

unanticipated litigation or negative developments in pending litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are a party to the litigation described in our sec filings and a number of other litigation matters including asbestos exposure cases disputes over the allocation of environmental remediation obligations at superfund and other sites disputes over water rights and disputes with regulatory authorities the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant monetary damages penalties or injunctive relief against us limitations on our property rights or regulatory interpretations that increase our operating costs if any of these disputes results in a substantial monetary judgment against us or an adverse legal interpretation is settled on unfavorable terms or otherwise affects our operations it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we depend on our senior management team and other key employees and the loss of any of these employees could adversely affect our business 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract retain and motivate senior management and other key employees achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions competitors’ hiring practices cost reduction activities and the effectiveness of our compensation programs competition for qualified personnel can be very intense we must continue to recruit retain and motivate senior management and other key employees sufficient to maintain our current business and support our future projects a loss of such personnel could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and our operating results could be adversely affected 

our holding company structure may impact your ability to receive dividends  

we are a holding company with no material assets other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries as a result our ability to repay our indebtedness and pay dividends is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend loan debt repayment or otherwise our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to make funds available to us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends dividends from subsidiaries that are not wholly owned are shared with other equity owners in addition cash at our international operations is subject to foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation into the us 

in addition our subsidiaries may not be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries’ assets upon their liquidation reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries’ creditors including any trade creditors and preferred stockholders 

 

 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult these provisions 

 

 

 

 

these provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our board of directors 

in addition because we are incorporated in delaware we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with or acquisition of us 

these provisions may deter an acquisition of us that might otherwise be attractive to stockholders

environmental proceedings 

pinal creek    we are a party to litigation entitled pinal creek group et al v newmont mining corporation et al  united states district court district of arizona case no civ 911764 phx dae loa filed on may 1 1991 the pinal creek site located near miami arizona was listed under the arizona department of environmental quality’s adeq water quality assurance revolving fund program in 1989 for contamination in the shallow alluvial aquifers within the pinal creek drainage near miami arizona since that time environmental remediation has been performed by members of the pinal creek group pcg consisting of phelps dodge miami inc miami a wholly owned subsidiary of freeportmcmoran corporation formerly phelps dodge corporation and two other companies in 1998 the district court approved a consent decree between the pcg members and the state of arizona resolving all matters related to an enforcement action contemplated by the state of arizona against the pcg members with respect to groundwater contamination the consent decree committed the pcg members to complete the remediation work outlined in the consent decree and that work continues at this time and is expected to continue for many years in the future 

  

remediation costs have been paid pursuant to an interim cost sharing allocation among the members of the pcg with miami’s interim allocation being approximately twothirds however there have been significant disagreements among the members of the pcg regarding the cost allocation with other members alleging in the federal court proceeding that miami should be responsible for substantially all of the costs in february 2010 we settled those disagreements and the associated litigation pursuant to the settlement agreement miami paid 40 million to other members of the pcg to settle the allocation of previously incurred costs and agreed to take full responsibility for future groundwater remediation at the pinal creek site with limited exceptions the settlement did not result in an adjustment of the related environmental reserve reflected in our financial statements 

blackwell oklahoma litigation  on april 14 2008 a purported class action was filed in the district court of kay county oklahoma against us and several of our direct and indirect subsidiaries including blackwell zinc company bzc  coffey et al v freeportmcmoran copper  gold inc et al  kay county oklahoma district court case no cj200868 this suit alleges that the operations of bzc’s zinc smelter in blackwell oklahoma from 1918 to 1974 resulted in contamination of the soils and groundwater in blackwell and the surrounding area unspecified compensatory and punitive damages are sought on behalf of the putative class members consisting of current and former residents and property owners for alleged diminution in property values there is also a request for an order compelling remediation of allegedly contaminated properties and the establishment of a monetary fund to monitor the present and future health of the putative class members

asbestos claims 

since approximately 1990 phelps dodge and various subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a large number of lawsuits claiming personal injury from exposure to asbestos contained in electrical wire products produced or marketed by phelps dodge affiliates many years ago or from asbestos contained in buildings and facilities located at properties owned or operated by phelps dodge affiliates 

water rights 

water law in the western us is generally based on the doctrine of prior appropriation first in time first in right and permits the water right holder the right to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location our operations in the western us require water for mining ore processing and related 

  

  

support facilities continuous operation of these mines is dependent on our ability to maintain our water rights and claims the loss of water rights in whole or in part could have a significant adverse affect on our mining operations 

two water rights adjudications have been initiated in the state of arizona in order to quantify and prioritize all surface water claims in two of the state’s river systems that include four of our operating mines morenci sierrita miami and safford these legal proceedings may also affect our bagdad arizona mine these adjudications have been under way for many years and we cannot predict when they will be concluded 

in re the general adjudication of all rights to use water in the little colorado water system and sources  apache county superior court no 6417 filed on or about february 17 1978 the principal parties in addition to us include the state of arizona the salt river project the arizona public service company the navajo nation the hopi indian tribe the san juan southern paiute tribe and the united states on its own behalf on behalf of those indian tribes and on behalf of the white mountain apache tribe

in 1998 we entered into a water rights settlement agreement with the gila river indian community gric which was later included in a comprehensive water rights settlement under the arizona water settlements act of 2004 the gric settlement is subject to contingencies and the comprehensive settlement has been challenged by other parties if we are unable to resolve the contingencies in the gric settlement and defeat the thirdparty challenges our water rights in the gila river watershed could be diminished and our operations at morenci sierrita miami and safford could be adversely affected 

prior to january 1 1983 various indian tribes filed suits in the us district court in arizona claiming superior rights to water being used by many other water users including us and claiming damages for prior use in derogation of their allegedly superior rights these federal proceedings have been stayed pending the arizona superior court adjudications 

united states v gila valley irrigation district  united states district court district of arizona was initiated in 1925 by the united states to settle conflicting claims to water rights in portions of the gila river watershed a decree settling the claims of various parties was entered in 1935 after morenci had been dismissed from the case without prejudice in 1988 the gila river indian community intervened challenging uses of water in the gila river watershed which may impact water that we have the right to divert annually from eagle creek chase creek or the san francisco river for operation of our morenci mine pursuant to decreed rights and an agreement between us and the gila valley irrigation district our morenci operations also purchased farm lands with water rights in 1997 1998 and 2008 that could be affected by the outcome of this proceeding impairment of our water claims in the gila river watershed could adversely affect the operations of our morenci and safford mines

general 

we are a leading international mining company with headquarters in phoenix arizona we are one of the world’s largest copper gold and molybdenum mining companies in terms of reserves and production our portfolio of assets includes the grasberg minerals district in indonesia which contains the largest single recoverable copper reserve and the largest single gold reserve of any mine in the world based on the latest available reserve data provided by thirdparty industry consultants significant mining operations in north and south america and the tenke fungurume development project in the democratic republic of congo drc 

as a mining company our principal assets are our reserves at december 31 2008 consolidated recoverable proven and probable reserves totaled 1020 billion pounds of copper 400 million ounces of gold 248 billion pounds of molybdenum 2666 million ounces of silver and 07 billion pounds of cobalt approximately 35 percent of our copper reserves were in indonesia approximately 31 percent were in south america approximately 28 percent were in north america and approximately six percent were in africa approximately 96 percent of our gold reserves were in indonesia with our remaining gold reserves located in south america our molybdenum reserves are primarily in north america approximately 85 percent with our remaining molybdenum reserves in south america refer to “ore reserves” 

our mining revenues for 2008 include sales of copper approximately 76 percent molybdenum approximately 14 percent and gold approximately seven percent we currently have five operating copper mines in north america four in south america and the grasberg minerals district in indonesia we also have one operating primary molybdenum mine in north america during 2008 approximately 60 percent of our consolidated copper production was from our grasberg morenci and cerro verde mines and more than half of our mined copper was sold in concentrate approximately 27 percent as rod principally from our north america operations and approximately 19 percent as cathodes for 2008 approximately 55 percent of our consolidated molybdenum production was from the henderson molybdenum mine and approximately 45 percent was produced as a byproduct primarily at our north america copper mines we also produce gold as a byproduct at our copper mines primarily at the grasberg minerals district in indonesia which accounted for approximately 90 percent of our consolidated gold production for 2008 refer to “mines” for further discussion of our mining operations 

prior to march 19 2007 we operated our grasberg mine in indonesia and our wholly owned copper smelting and refining operation at atlantic copper in spain on march 19 2007 we acquired phelps dodge a fully integrated producer of copper and molybdenum with mines in north and south america and several development projects including tenke fungurume in the drc which we believe is one of the world’s highest potential copper and cobalt concessions after completion of the phelps dodge acquisition our business strategy was focused on repaying acquisitionrelated debt defining the potential of our resources and developing expansion and growth plans to deliver additional volumes to a growing marketplace during 2007 we repaid 100 billion in term loans using a combination of equity proceeds and internally generated cash flows because of the significant reduction in debt and historically high prices for copper molybdenum and gold our financial policy during most of 2008 was designed to use our cash flow to invest in growth projects with anticipated high rates of return and to return excess cash flows to shareholders in the form of dividends and share purchases in response to the severity of the decline in copper and molybdenum prices and the deterioration of economic conditions and credit environment during fourthquarter 2008 we revised our nearterm business strategy to protect liquidity while preserving our large mineral resources and growth options for the long term for additional information refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

 

in north america we currently have five operating copper mines – morenci sierrita bagdad and safford in arizona and tyrone in new mexico in addition the chino mine in new mexico was placed on careandmaintenance status in december 2008 all of these operations are wholly owned except for morenci an unincorporated joint venture in which we own an 85 percent undivided interest in addition to copper the morenci sierrita and bagdad mines produce molybdenum as a byproduct 

in south america we have four operating copper mines – cerro verde in peru and candelaria ojos del salado and el abra in chile we own a 5356 percent interest in cerro verde an 80 percent interest in both candelaria and ojos del salado and a 51 percent interest in el abra in addition to copper the cerro verde mine produces molybdenum concentrate as a byproduct and the candelaria and ojos del salado mines produce gold and silver as byproducts 

in indonesia pt freeport indonesia operates the grasberg minerals district we have joint venture agreements with rio tinto plc rio tinto an international mining company with respect to a portion of our mining activities in indonesia as described in the “mines” section we own 9064 percent of pt freeport indonesia and the government of indonesia owns the remaining 936 percent interest our grasberg minerals district also produces significant quantities of gold and silver as byproducts pt freeport indonesia also owns 25 percent of pt smelting a smelting and refining company in gresik indonesia 

we produce molybdenum at our wholly owned henderson molybdenum mine in colorado which is the largest primary producer of molybdenum in the world additionally we own the climax molybdenum mine in colorado which is currently on careandmaintenance status 

in addition to our operating mines we have several significant mines in development in indonesia we are developing our underground mines in africa we hold an effective 5775 percent interest in the tenke fungurume copper and cobalt concession in the drc the tenke fungurume mine will produce copper and cobalt and is expected to commence mining operations in the second half of 2009

copper molybdenum and gold 

our mines primarily produce copper molybdenum and gold a brief discussion of the production and sales of these metals appears below discussion of markets and prices for these metals appears in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

copper 

copper in the form of copper cathode is an internationally traded commodity and its prices are determined by the major metals exchanges – new york mercantile exchange comex the london metals exchange lme and the shanghai futures exchange shfe prices on these exchanges generally reflect the worldwide balance of copper supply and demand and can be volatile and cyclical 

our copper ores are generally processed either by smelting and refining or by solution extraction and electrowinning sxew in the smelting process ore is crushed and further treated to produce a copper concentrate with an average copper content of about 30 percent copper concentrate is then smelted subjected to extreme heat to produce copper anodes which weigh between 800 and 900 pounds and have an average copper content of 995 percent the anodes are further treated by electrolytic refining to produce copper cathodes which weigh between 100 and 350 pounds and have a copper content of 9999 percent 

in the sxew process copper is extracted from ore by dissolving it with a weak sulfuric acid solution the copper content of the solution is increased in two additional solutionextraction stages and then the copperbearing solution undergoes an electrowinning process to produce cathode that is 9999 percent copper 

our copper cathodes are used as the raw material input for copper rod brass mill products and for other uses in general demand for copper reflects the rate of underlying world economic growth particularly in industrial production and construction according to brook hunt a widely followed independent metals market consultant copper’s enduse markets and their estimated shares of total consumption are 

 

 

molybdenum 

molybdenum is a key alloying element in steel and the raw material for several chemicalgrade products used in catalysts lubrication smoke suppression corrosion inhibition and pigmentation molybdenum as a highpurity metal is also used in electronics such as flatpanel displays and in super alloys used in aerospace first enduser segments for molybdenum include 

 

molybdenum is currently not traded on any public exchange reference prices for molybdenum are available in several publications including platts metals week  ryan’s notes and metal bulletin  

gold 

gold is used for jewelry coinage and bullion as well as various industrial and electronic applications gold can be readily sold on numerous markets throughout the world benchmark prices are generally based on london bullion market association quotations 

products and sales 

copper products 

we are one of the world’s leading producers of copper concentrate cathode and continuous cast copper rod for 2008 more than half of our copper was sold in concentrate approximately 27 percent as rod principally from our north america operations and approximately 19 percent as cathodes 

copper concentrate  through 2008 we produced copper concentrate at eight mines of which pt freeport indonesia is our largest producer in 2008 approximately 56 percent of pt freeport indonesia’s concentrate was refined at affiliated smelters atlantic copper and pt smelting 

copper concentrate was also produced at our morenci sierrita and bagdad mines in arizona and our chino mine in new mexico which was generally shipped to our miami smelter in arizona in south america we produced copper concentrate at our cerro verde mine in peru and our candelaria and ojos del salado mines in chile in late 2008 we suspended production of concentrates at chino and plan to suspend concentrate production at morenci in firstquarter 2009 in response to current market conditions 

copper cathode  through 2008 we produced copper cathode at two electrolytic refineries and nine mines our refineries are located in el paso texas and huelva spain pt smelting also produces copper cathode we produced sxew cathode from our morenci sierrita bagdad chino safford tyrone and miami mines in north america and our cerro verde and el abra mines in south america in the second half of 2009 we will begin sxew production at our tenke fungurume mine in the drc  

continuous cast copper rod  we manufacture continuous cast copper rod at our facilities in el paso texas norwich connecticut and miami arizona in late 2008 we permanently closed our chicago illinois rod mill 

other copper products  we produce specialty copper products at our bayway operations in elizabeth new jersey these products include specialty copper alloys in the forms of rod bar and strip we manufacture electrode wire for use in welding steel cans at our norwich connecticut and el paso texas facilities we also produce copper sulfate pentahydrate for use in agricultural and industrial applications at our facility in sierrita arizona 

copper sales 

north america  the majority of the copper produced at our north america copper mines and refined in our el paso refinery is consumed at our rod plants in el paso texas norwich connecticut and miami arizona the remainder of our north america copper production is sold in the form of copper cathode or copper concentrate to third parties generally copper rod and cathode are sold to wire and cable fabricators and brass mills under 

 

united states us dollardenominated annual contracts cathode and rod contract prices are generally based on the prevailing comex monthly average spot price for the month of shipment and include a premium 

south america    production from our south america copper mines is generally sold as copper concentrate or copper cathode under us dollardenominated annual and multiyear contracts cerro verde sells approximately 70 percent of its production as concentrate and the rest as cathode some of cerro verde’s cathode is sold under annual contract terms to south american customers a portion of cerro verde’s and candelaria’s concentrate production is sold at market rates to atlantic copper a majority of our ojos del salado concentrate production is sold to local chilean smelters el abra’s cathode production is sold primarily under annual or multiyear contracts to asian or european rod or brass mill customers or to merchants the remainder of the cathode and concentrate production is primarily sold under longterm contracts to external customers largely located in asia with the balance sold on a spot basis 

our south america sales are priced based on the lme monthly average spot price cathode sales are generally priced in the month of arrival and generally include a premium substantially all of our concentrate sales are priced in the third calendar month following the month of arrival at the buyer’s facilities revenues from south america concentrate sales are recorded net of treatment and refining charges treatment and refining charges are fees paid to smelters and refiners and are generally negotiated annually moreover because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrates is unrecoverable from the smelting process our revenues from concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances based on the quantity and value of these unrecoverable metals these allowances are a negotiated term of our contracts and vary by customer 

indonesia    pt freeport indonesia sells its production in the form of copper concentrate which contains significant quantities of byproduct gold and silver under us dollardenominated sales agreements with more than half of pt freeport indonesia’s production sold to atlantic copper and pt smelting we sell substantially all of our budgeted production of copper concentrates under longterm contracts in general our concentrate sales are priced on the basis of the lme average spot price for the third calendar month following the month of arrival at the buyer’s facilities 

pt freeport indonesia has a longterm contract to provide atlantic copper with approximately 55 percent of its current concentrate requirements at market prices 

 

pt freeport indonesia’s contract with pt smelting provides for the supply of 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements necessary to produce 205000 metric tons of copper annually essentially the smelter’s original design capacity on a priority basis refer to “smelting facilities” for further discussion 

we anticipate that pt freeport indonesia will sell approximately 50 percent of its annual concentrate production to atlantic copper and pt smelting in 2009 a summary of pt freeport indonesia’s aggregate percentage concentrate sales to pt smelting atlantic copper and to other parties for the last three years follows 

 

pt freeport indonesia’s sales to pt smelting represented approximately eight percent of our consolidated revenues in 2008 11 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2007 and approximately 21 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2006 no other customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated revenues in any of the three years ended december 31 2008 

revenues from our indonesia concentrate sales are recorded net of royalties refer to “mines – indonesia – contracts of work” and treatment and refining charges including price participation charges if applicable based on the market prices of metals similar to our south america mines indonesia concentrate sales are net of allowances for unrecoverable metals pt freeport indonesia sells a small amount of copper concentrates in the spot market 

europe    atlantic copper sells copper cathode directly to rod and brass mills primarily located in europe atlantic 

 

copper has occasionally sold copper cathode to merchants copper cathode is generally sold under annual contracts and priced based on the lme average spot price for the month of arrival 

molybdenum products and sales 

we are the world’s largest producer of molybdenum and molybdenumbased chemicals in addition to production from our henderson molybdenum mine we have produced byproduct molybdenum at our morenci sierrita and bagdad mines in arizona our chino mine in new mexico and our cerro verde mine in peru however in december 2008 we temporarily curtailed the molybdenum circuit at morenci and in 2009 we plan to temporarily curtail the molybdenum circuits at chino and cerro verde 

the majority of our molybdenum concentrates are processed in our own conversion facilities technicalgrade oxide is produced from molybdenum concentrates in sierrita arizona fort madison iowa and rotterdam the netherlands ferromolybdenum is produced from technicalgrade oxide in stowmarket united kingdom through a metallothermic reduction process highquality molybdenum concentrates are converted into molybdenum chemicals at fort madison iowa and rotterdam the netherlands approximately 90 percent of our expected 2009 molybdenum sales are expected to be priced at prevailing market prices 

gold products and sales 

gold and other byproducts are primarily sold as a component of our copper concentrate or in slimes which are a byproduct of the smelting and refining process gold generally is priced at the average london bullion market association price for a specified month near the month of shipment 

for an allocation of our consolidated revenues by geographic area refer to note 19 – “business segments”

curtailed facilities 

the following table summarizes the temporary curtailments announced in late 2008 and early 2009 in response to current market conditions for additional information refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

 

as a result of these curtailments copper production is expected to be reduced by 400 million pounds in 2009 and 800 million pounds in 2010 and molybdenum production is expected to be reduced by 20 million pounds in 2009 and 40 million pounds in 2010 compared with our previously announced october 2008 estimated production for 

 

2009 and 2010 projected copper production is expected to be 39 billion pounds in 2009 and 38 billion pounds in 2010 projected molybdenum production is expected to be 60 million pounds in both 2009 and 2010 the affected mine sites will be idling or reducing utilization of a portion of their equipment fleets in connection with these curtailments 

 

we are continuing to closely monitor market conditions and may make further reductions to our production and sales plans

cerro verde receives electrical power under longterm contracts with electroperu and empresa de generación eléctrica de arequipa the existing freshwater intake and supply system on the rio chili was expanded for the cerro verde concentrator project cerro verde’s participation in the pillones reservoir project has secured water rights that we believe will be sufficient to support cerro verde’s currently planned operations however rainfall in 2008 was below normal and the rainy season in 2009 which ends in march has been below normal reservoir levels are currently about half of the fiveyear average for this time of year 

el abra 

el abra is an openpit copper mining complex located 47 miles north of calama in chile’s el loa province region ii the site is accessible by paved highway and by rail we own a 51 percent interest in el abra the remaining 49 percent interest is held by the stateowned copper enterprise corporación nacional del cobre de chile codelco the mine has been in operation since 1996 

the el abra mine is a porphyry copper deposit that has oxide and sulfide mineralization the predominant oxide copper minerals are chrysocolla and pseudomalachite there are lesser amounts of copperbearing clays and tenorite the predominant primary sulfide copper minerals are bornite and chalcopyrite there is a minor amount of secondary sulfide mineralization as chalcocite 

the el abra operation consists of an openpit copper mine and an sxew facility with a capacity of 500 million pounds of copper cathode per year from a 120000 metric tonperday crushed leach circuit and a similarsized rom leaching operation copper production for 2008 was 366 million pounds the mining operation has sufficient equipment to move an average of 223000 metric tons per day using an available fleet of 26 220metric ton haul trucks loaded by four shovels with buckets ranging in size from 26 to 41 cubic meters 

we have the opportunity to develop a large sulfide deposit at el abra that will extend the mine life by over 10 years copper production from the sulfide deposit is estimated to average approximately 325 million pounds per 

 

year replacing the depleting oxide production we had previously planned to begin development of this project in 2009 to reach full production in 2012 however in response to current market conditions we are deferring construction activities on this project we will continue to assess the timing of this project and will be prepared to proceed with construction activities when market conditions improve total initial capital for the project is estimated to approximate 450 million 

el abra is located in a desert environment with rainfall averaging less than one inch per year and is in an active seismic zone the highest bench elevation is 4180 meters above sea level and the ultimate pit bottom is expected to be 3410 meters above sea level el abra controls a total of 110268 acres of mining claims covering the ore deposit stockpiles process plant and water wellfield and pipeline in addition el abra has acquired land surface rights for the road between the processing plant and the mine the water wellfield power transmission lines and for the water pipeline from the salar de ascotán acquisition of additional land surface area required for the future development of the sulfide project is in process 

el abra currently receives electrical power under a contract with electroandina which will expire at the end of 2017 we believe el abra has sufficient water rights to support currently planned operations 

candelaria and ojos del salado 

candelaria  candelaria is an openpit and underground copper mining complex located approximately 12 miles south of copiapó in northern chile’s atacama province region iii the site is accessible by two maintained dirt roads one coming through the tierra amarilla community and the other off of route 5 of the international panamerican highway we have an 80 percent ownership interest in candelaria the remaining 20 percent interest is owned by affiliates of the sumitomo corporation the openpit copper mine has been in operation since 1993 and the underground copper mine has been in operation since 2005 

the candelaria mine is an iron oxide coppergold deposit primary sulfide mineralization consists of chalcopyrite 

the candelaria operation consists of an openpit copper mine and a 6000 metric tonperday underground copper mine which is mined by sublevel stoping feeding a 75000 metric tonperday concentrator on average openpit mining operations move 210000 metric tons of material per day using an available fleet of 48 225metric ton haul trucks loaded by six shovels with bucket sizes ranging from 13 to 43 cubic meters copper concentrates are transported by truck to the punta padrones port facility located in caldera approximately 50 miles northwest of the mine copper production for 2008 was 383 million pounds and gold production was 98000 ounces in early 2009 we revised our operating plan to reduce the mining rate at candelaria 

candelaria is located in a desert environment with rainfall averaging less than one inch per year and is in an active seismic zone the highest bench elevation is 675 meters above sea level and the ultimate pit bottom is expected to be 30 meters below sea level the candelaria property encompasses approximately 13390 acres including approximately 544 acres for the port facility in caldera the remaining property consists of mineral rights owned by us in which the surface is not owned but controlled by us which is consistent with chilean law 

 

candelaria receives electrical power through longterm contracts with empresa eléctrica guacolda sa a local energy company candelaria’s water supply comes from well fields in the area of tierra amarilla and copiapó that draw water from the copiapó river aquifer because of rapid depletion of that aquifer in recent years ongoing studies are addressing the adequacy of this water supply for candelaria’s currently planned operations 

ojos del salado  ojos del salado consists of two underground copper mines santos and alcaparrosa and a 3800 metric tonperday concentrator the operation is located approximately 10 miles east of copiapó in northern chile’s atacama province region iii and is accessible by paved highway we have an 80 percent ownership interest in ojos del salado the remaining 20 percent interest is owned by affiliates of the sumitomo corporation the ojos del salado operation began commercial production in 1929 

the ojos del salado mines are iron oxide and coppergold deposits primary sulfide mineralization consists of chalcopyrite 

the ojos del salado operation has a capacity of 3800 metric tons per day of ore from the santos underground mine and 4000 metric tons per day from the alcaparrosa underground mine the ore from both mines is mined by sublevel stoping since both the ore and enclosing rocks are competent the broken ore is removed from the stopes using scoops and loaded into an available fleet of 18 28metric ton trucks which transport the ore to the surface the ore from the santos mine is hauled directly to the ojos del salado mill for processing and the ore from the alcaparrosa mine is reloaded into five 54metric ton trucks and hauled 12 miles to the candelaria mill for processing the ojos del salado concentrator has the capacity to produce over 30 million pounds of copper and 9000 ounces of gold per year copper production for 2008 was 63 million pounds and gold production was 16000 ounces in early 2009 we revised our operating plan to reduce the mining rate at ojos del salado tailings from the ojos del salado mill are pumped to the candelaria tailings facility for final deposition the candelaria facility has sufficient capacity for the remaining ojos del salado tailings in addition to candelaria’s tailings 

ojos del salado is located in a desert environment with rainfall averaging less than one inch per year and is in an active seismic zone the highest underground level is at an elevation of 500 meters above sea level with the lowest underground level at 150 meters above sea level the ojos del salado mineral rights encompass approximately 15815 acres which includes approximately 6784 acres of owned land in and around the ojos del salado underground mines and plant site the remaining property consists of mineral rights owned by us in which the surface is not owned but controlled by us which is consistent with chilean law 

ojos del salado receives electrical power through longterm contracts with empresa eléctrica guacolda sa ojos del salado’s water supply comes from the copiapó river aquifer because of rapid depletion of this aquifer in recent years ongoing studies are addressing the adequacy of this water supply for ojos del salado’s currently planned operations 

indonesia 

ownership 

pt freeport indonesia is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the republic of indonesia and incorporated in delaware we directly own 8128 percent of pt freeport indonesia 936 percent indirectly through our wholly owned subsidiary pt indocopper investama and the government of indonesia owns the remaining 936 percent 

in july 2004 we received a request from the indonesian department of energy and mineral resources that we offer to sell shares in pt indocopper investama to indonesian nationals at fair market value refer to note 16 – “commitments and guarantees” for additional discussion 

in 1996 we established joint ventures with rio tinto plc rio tinto an international mining company with headquarters in london england one joint venture covers pt freeport indonesia’s mining operations in block a and gives rio tinto through 2021 a 40 percent interest in certain assets and future production exceeding specified annual amounts of copper gold and silver in block a and after 2021 a 40 percent interest in all production from block a operating nonexpansion capital and administrative costs are shared proportionately 

 

between pt freeport indonesia and rio tinto based on the ratio of a the incremental revenues from production from our expansion completed in 1998 to b total revenues from block a including production from pt freeport indonesia’s previously existing reserves pt freeport indonesia receives 100 percent of the cash flow from specified annual amounts of copper gold and silver through 2021 calculated by reference to its proven and probable reserves as of december 31 1994 and 60 percent of all remaining cash flow pt freeport indonesia records its joint venture interest using the proportionate consolidation method under the joint venture agreements virtually all of the 2008 cash flows from pt freeport indonesias operations were attributed to pt freeport indonesia 

 

contracts of work 

through a contract of work cow with the government of indonesia pt freeport indonesia conducts its current exploration and mining operations in indonesia the cow governs our rights and obligations relating to taxes exchange controls royalties repatriation and other matters and was concluded pursuant to the 1967 foreign capital investment law which expresses indonesia’s foreign investment policy and provides basic guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization a framework for economic incentives and basic rules regarding other rights and obligations of foreign investors specifically the cow provides that the government of indonesia will not nationalize or expropriate pt freeport indonesia’s mining operations any disputes regarding the provisions of the cow are subject to international arbitration we have experienced no disputes requiring arbitration during the 40 years we have operated in indonesia 

pt freeport indonesia’s cow covers both block a which was first included in a 1967 cow that was replaced by a new cow in 1991 and block b in which we gained rights in 1991 the initial term of our cow expires in december 2021 but we can extend it for two 10year periods subject to indonesian government approval that cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably the cow allows us to conduct exploration mining and production activities in the 24700acre block a area located in papua all of pt freeport indonesia’s proven and probable mineral reserves and current mining operations are located in block a under the cow pt freeport indonesia also conducts exploration activities which had been suspended but resumed in 2007 in the approximate 500000acre block b area in papua we originally had the rights to explore 65 million acres in block b but pursuant to the cow we have only retained the rights to approximately 500000 acres following significant geological assessment 

pt freeport indonesia pays a copper royalty under its cow that varies from 15 percent of copper net revenue at a copper price of 090 or less per pound to 35 percent at a copper price of 110 or more per pound the cow royalty rate for gold and silver sales is 10 percent 

a large part of the mineral royalties under government of indonesia regulations are designated to the provinces from which the minerals are extracted in connection with our fourth concentrator mill expansion completed in 1998 pt freeport indonesia agreed to pay the government of indonesia additional royalties royalties not required by our cow to provide further support to the local governments and the people of the indonesia province of papua the additional royalties are paid on production exceeding specified annual amounts of copper gold and silver expected to be generated when pt freeport indonesia’s milling facilities operate above 200000 metric tons of ore per day the additional royalty for copper equals the cow royalty rate and for gold and silver equals twice the cow royalty rates therefore pt freeport indonesia’s royalty rate on copper net revenues from production above the agreed levels is double the cow royalty rate and royalty rates on gold and silver sales from production above the agreed levels are triple the cow royalty rates pt freeport indonesia’s share of the combined royalties including the additional royalties which became effective january 1 1999 totaled 113 million in 2008 133 million in 2007 and 126 million in 2006 

pt irja eastern minerals eastern minerals of which we own 100 percent conducts exploration under a separate cow in an area covering approximately 450000 acres in papua 

under a joint venture agreement through pt nabire bakti mining we conduct exploration activities under a separate cow in an area covering approximately 500000 acres in five parcels contiguous to pt freeport indonesia’s block b and one of eastern minerals’ blocks 

in 2008 indonesia enacted a new mining law which will operate under a licensing system as opposed to the cow system that applies to pt freeport indonesia and eastern materials the new law indicates that existing cows will be honored but that certain provisions should be adjusted to conform to the new law it is not clear 

 

what adjustments if any may be requested by the government of indonesia but we are committed to continuing to honor and abide by the terms of our cow and the government has consistently indicated that it will honor all existing contracts 

grasberg minerals district 

pt freeport indonesia operates in the remote highlands of the sudirman mountain range in the province of papua indonesia which is on the western half of the island of new guinea we and our predecessors have conducted exploration and mining operations in block a since 1967 and have been the only operator of these operations we currently have two mines in operation the grasberg open pit and the deep ore zone doz underground block cave 

grasberg open pit      we began openpit mining of the grasberg ore body in 1990 openpit operations are expected to continue through 2015 at which time the grasberg underground mining operations are scheduled to begin production is currently at the 3295 to 4285meter elevation level and totaled 490 million metric tons of ore in 2008 and 575 million metric tons of ore in 2007 which provided 67 percent of our 2008 mill feed and 75 percent of our 2007 mill feed remaining mill feed comes from our doz mine 

the current grasberg equipment fleet consists of over 500 units at december 31 2008 the larger mining equipment directly associated with production included an available fleet of 157 haul trucks with payloads ranging from approximately 215 metric tons to 330 metric tons and 19 shovels with bucket sizes ranging from 30 cubic meters to 42 cubic meters which in 2008 moved an average of 669000 metric tons per day 

grasberg crushing and conveying systems are integral to the mine and provide the capacity to transport up to 225000 metric tons per day of grasberg ore to the mill and 135000 metric tons per day of overburden to the overburden stockpiles the remaining ore and overburden is moved by haul trucks 

deep ore zone  the doz ore body lies vertically below the now depleted intermediate ore zone we began production from the doz ore body in 1989 using open stope mining methods but we suspended production in 1991 in favor of production from the grasberg deposit production resumed in september 2000 using the blockcave method production is at the 3110meter elevation level and totaled 231 million metric tons of ore in 2008 and 195 million metric tons in 2007 

during 2008 we completed over 16000 meters of development drifting in support of the blockcave mining method for the doz mine further expansion of the doz operation to 80000 metric tons of ore per day is under way with completion targeted by 2010 the success of the development of the doz mine one of the world’s 

 

largest underground mines provides confidence in the future development of pt freeport indonesia’s largescale undeveloped underground ore bodies 

the doz mine fleet consists of over 185 pieces of mobile heavy equipment which in 2008 moved an average of 63000 metric tons of ore per day the primary mining equipment directly associated with production and development includes an available fleet of 50 lhd units and 19 haul trucks our production lhd units typically carry approximately 11 metric tons of ore using ore passes and chutes the lhd units transfer ore into 55ton capacity haul trucks the trucks dump into two gyratory crushers and the ore is then conveyed to the surface stockpiles 

pt freeport indonesia’s total production for 2008 was 11 billion pounds of copper and 12 million ounces of gold 

our principal source of power for all our indonesian operations is a coalfired power plant that we built in conjunction with our fourth concentrator mill expansion diesel generators supply peaking and backup electrical power generating capacity a combination of naturally occurring mountain streams and water derived from our underground operations provides water for our operations our indonesian operations are in an active seismic zone and experience average annual rainfall of approximately 200 inches 

description of ore bodies  our indonesia ore bodies are located within and around two main igneous intrusions the grasberg monzodiorite and the ertsberg diorite the host rocks of these ore bodies include both carbonate and clastic rocks that form the ridge crests and upper flanks of the sudirman range and the igneous rocks of monzonitic to dioritic composition that intrude them the igneoushosted ore bodies the grasberg open pit and block cave and the doz block cave occur as vein stockworks and disseminations of copper sulfides dominated by chalcopyrite and to a much lesser extent bornite the sedimentaryrock hosted ore bodies occur as “magnetiterich calciummagnesian skarn” replacements whose location and orientation are strongly influenced by major faults and by the chemistry of the carbonate rocks along the margins of the intrusions 

the copper mineralization in these skarn deposits is also dominated by chalcopyrite but higher bornite concentrations are common moreover gold occurs in significant concentrations in all of the district’s ore bodies though rarely visible to the naked eye these gold concentrations usually occur as inclusions within the copper sulfide minerals though in some deposits these concentrations can also be strongly associated with pyrite 

the following diagram indicates the relative elevations in meters of our reported ore bodies 

 

 

 

the following map which encompasses an area of approximately 42 square kilometers approximately 16 square miles indicates the relative positions and sizes of our reported ore bodies and their locations 

 

 

africa 

we are developing the initial project at tenke fungurume in the drc at tenke fungurume mine properties and facilities are controlled through mining concessions under general mining laws the concessions are owned or controlled by operating companies in which we or our subsidiaries have an ownership interest 

tenke fungurume 

the tenke fungurume deposits are located in the katanga province of the drc approximately 110 miles northwest of lubumbashi the deposits are accessible by unpaved roads and by rail we hold an effective 5775 percent interest in the concessions through our interest in tenke fungurume mining sarl a company incorporated under the laws of the drc and are the operator of the project the remaining ownership interests 

 

are held by tenke mining corp tmc which is owned by lundin mining corporation an effective 2475 percent and la générale des carrières et des mines gécamines which is wholly owned by the government of the drc 175 percent we are responsible for funding 70 percent of project development costs and are also responsible for financing our partner’s share of certain cost overruns on the initial project gecamines has an undilutable carried interest and is not responsible for funding any project costs in accordance with the terms of the agreement gecamines will receive asset transfer payments totaling 100 million 70 million of which has already been paid and the remainder of which will be paid over a period of approximately three years 

the tenke fungurume deposits are sedimenthosted copper and cobalt deposits with oxide mixed oxidesulfide and sulfide mineralization the dominant oxide minerals are malachite pseudomalachite and heterogenite important sulfide minerals consist of bornite carrollite chalcocite and chalcopyrite 

copper and cobalt will be recovered through an agitationleach plant capable of processing 8000 metric tons of ore per day construction activities are well advanced and initial production is targeted during the second half of 2009 annual production in the initial years is expected to approximate 250 million pounds of copper and 18 million pounds of cobalt the initial project is based on mining and processing ore reserves approximating 119 million metric tons with an average grade of 26 percent copper and 035 percent cobalt we expect the results of drilling activities will enable future expansion of initial production rates the timing of these expansions will depend on a number of factors including general economic and market conditions the current equipment fleet includes 8 fivecubic meter frontend loaders 29 45metric ton haul trucks surface miners production drills sampling machines and crawler dozers 

tenke fungurume is located in a tropical region however temperatures are moderated by its higher altitudes weather in this region is characterized by a dry season and a wet season each lasting about six months with average rainfall of 47 inches per year the highest bench elevation is expected to be 1480 meters above sea level and the ultimate pit bottom is expected to be 1270 meters above sea level the tenke fungurume deposits are located within four concessions totaling 394455 acres 

tenke fungurume has entered into longterm power supply and infrastructure funding agreements with la société nationale d’electricité snel the stateowned electric utility company serving the region the results of a recent water exploration program as well as the regional geological and hydrogeological conditions indicate that adequate water is available for the project and for hydroelectric generation during the expected life of the operation 

 

in february 2008 the ministry of mines government of the drc sent a letter seeking comment on proposed material modifications to the mining contracts for the tenke fungurume concession refer to note 16 – “commitments and guarantees” for additional discussion 

 

during october 2008 fighting between rebel groups and the national congolese army erupted in the drc and hostilities have continued in the eastern province of north kivu which is more than 1000 kilometers from our project site and not easily accessible by road this conflict has resulted in increased instability in the drc we will continue to monitor the situation while continuing with our development project

development projects and exploration 

 

we have several projects and potential opportunities to expand our production volumes extend our mine lives and develop largescale underground ore bodies in response to the sharp declines in copper and molybdenum prices and the deterioration of the economic environment during fourthquarter 2008 we have deferred most of our project development activities including incremental expansions in north and south america the planned restart of the miami mine development of the el abra sulfide project and the restart of the climax molybdenum mine and have also reduced capital spending at tenke fungurume and in indonesia for further discussion of our development projects and exploration activities refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

in addition to current development project activities for the common infrastructure project the grasberg block cave the big gossan underground mine and the doz expansion discussed in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we have additional longterm underground mine development projects in the grasberg minerals district for the deep mill level zone and kucing liar ore bodies which are discussed below and are based on our latest mine plans and proven and probable reserves as of december 31 2008 

the mill level zone and deep mill level zone ore bodies are reported as one ore body as the deep mill level zone the deep mill level zone lies directly below the doz mine at the 2590meter elevation this ore represents the downward continuation of mineralization in the ertsberg east skarn system and neighboring ertsberg porphyry drilling efforts continue to determine the extent of this ore body we expect to mine the deep mill level zone using a blockcave method near completion of mining at the doz we expect to complete the feasibility study on this ore body in the second half of 2009 prefeasibility estimates of aggregate capital costs for the deep mill level zone are expected to aggregate 13 billion 

the kucing liar ore body lies on the southern flank of and underneath the southern portion of the grasberg open pit at the 2605meter elevation level we expect to mine the kucing liar ore body using the blockcave method prefeasibility studies for the development of the kucing liar ore body indicate aggregate capital costs of approximately 14 billion a feasibility study is expected to commence during 2009 

based on our current estimates we expect aggregate expenditures for underground mine development to average approximately 350 million annually during the next 15 years in addition these costs will be shared with rio tinto in accordance with our joint venture agreement 

 

considering the longterm nature of these projects actual costs could differ materially from these estimates

 

in addition to the mine development costs above our current mine development plans include approximately 3 billion of capital expenditures at our processing facilities to optimize the handling of underground ore types once grasberg openpit operations cease we continue to review our mine development and processing plans to maximize the value of our reserves

 

research 

following our acquisition of phelps dodge in march 2007 we conduct research and development programs relating to technology for exploration for minerals mining and recovery of metals from ores concentrates and solutions smelting and refining of copper metal processing reclamation and remediation and product and engineered 

 

materials development most of our research is conducted at our technology centers in safford and sahuarita arizona expenditures for research and development programs together with contributions to industry and governmentsupported research programs totaled 44 million in 2008 and 33 million in 2007 expenditures are expected to be substantially lower in 2009 in connection with companywide steps to reduce expenditures in response to lower copper and molybdenum prices 

smelting facilities 

atlantic copper  sa atlantic copper is our wholly owned copper smelter and refinery located in huelva spain atlantic copper completed the last expansion of its production capacity in 1997 the design capacity of the smelter is 290000 metric tons of copper per year and the refinery currently has a capacity of 260000 metric tons of copper per year we have no present plans to expand atlantic copper’s production capacity atlantic copper’s facilities are located on land concessions from the huelva spain port authorities the smelter and refinery concessions expire in 2022 and the office and warehouse concessions expire in 2014 

during 2008 atlantic copper treated 1028100 metric tons of concentrate and scrap and produced 259900 metric tons of copper anodes and 257100 metric tons of copper cathodes during 2007 atlantic copper treated 952300 metric tons of concentrate and scrap and produced 256100 metric tons of copper anodes and 243600 metric tons of copper cathodes in june 2007 atlantic copper completed a scheduled 23day maintenance turnaround major maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately every 12 years for atlantic copper with significantly shorter term maintenance turnarounds occurring in the interim the next scheduled maintenance activity at atlantic copper is in 2011 

atlantic copper purchased approximately 45 percent of its 2008 concentrate requirements from pt freeport indonesia and approximately 12 percent from our south america mines at market prices atlantic copper has experienced no significant operating problems 

we made no capital contributions to atlantic copper from 2005 through 2008 however we contributed 202 million to atlantic copper in 2004 in addition we loaned 190 million to atlantic copper in 2004 and atlantic copper repaid 60 million in 2008 the funds were used to improve atlantic copper’s financial structure during its 2004 major maintenance turnaround and during a period of extremely low rates for treatment and refining charges our net investment in atlantic copper through december 31 2008 was approximately 138 million 

pt smelting  pt freeport indonesia’s 1991 cow required us to construct or cause to be constructed a smelter in indonesia if we and the indonesian government determined that such a project would be economically viable in 1995 following the completion of a feasibility study we entered into agreements relating to the formation of pt smelting an indonesian company and the construction of the copper smelter in gresik indonesia pt freeport indonesia mitsubishi materials corporation mitsubishi materials mitsubishi corporation mitsubishi and nippon mining  metals co ltd nippon own 25 percent 605 percent 95 percent and 5 percent respectively of the outstanding pt smelting common stock pt smelting owns and operates the smelter and refinery in gresik indonesia 

during 2006 pt smelting completed an expansion of its production capacity to 275000 metric tons of copper per year from 250000 metric tons pt freeport indonesia’s contract with pt smelting provides for the supply of 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements necessary for pt smelting to produce 205000 metric tons of copper annually essentially the smelter’s original design capacity on a priority basis for the first 15 years of pt smelting’s commercial operations beginning december 1998 pt freeport indonesia agreed that the combined treatment and refining charges fees paid to smelters by miners would approximate market rates but will not fall below specified minimum rates the minimum rate applicable to the period april 27 2008 to april 27 2014 is to be determined annually and to be sufficient to cover pt smelting’s annual cash operating costs net of credits and including costs of debt service for 205000 metric tons of copper the maximum rate is 030 per pound the agreement is an amendment to the longterm contract which is pending approval from the department of energy and mineral resources of the government of indonesia pt freeport indonesia also sells copper concentrate to pt smelting at market rates which are not subject to a minimum or maximum rate for quantities in excess of 205000 metric tons of copper annually 

 

during 2008 pt smelting treated 978100 metric tons of concentrate and produced 261300 metric tons of copper anodes and 253400 metric tons of copper cathodes during 2007 pt smelting treated 976300 metric tons of concentrate and produced 277100 metric tons of copper anodes and 256900 metric tons of copper 

 

cathodes lower volumes of anodes in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily reflect a 25day maintenance turnaround in the second quarter of 2008 major maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately every four years for pt smelting with significantly shorter term maintenance turnarounds in the interim 

miami smelter  we own and operate a smelter at our miami arizona mining operation the miami mine is currently on careandmaintenance status but the smelter continues to process concentrate primarily from our morenci bagdad and sierrita mines the smelter has been in production for over 80 years and has been upgraded during that period to implement new technologies to improve production and to comply with current air quality standards concentrate processed through the smelter totaled approximately 719000 metric tons in 2008 and 759000 metric tons in 2007 the miami smelter completed a 40day major maintenance turnaround in february 2009 major maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately every 29 months for miami with significantly shorter term maintenance turnarounds in the interim sulfuric acid is a byproduct of smelting concentrates and the miami smelter is the most significant source of sulfuric acid for our domestic leaching operations

energy including electricity diesel fuel coal and natural gas sulfuric acid and water are the principal raw materials used in our operations most of our energy is obtained from third parties under longterm contracts for additional information refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

 

sulfuric acid is used in the sxew process and is produced as a byproduct of the smelting process at our smelters sulfuric acid needs in excess of the sulfuric acid produced by our operations are purchased from third parties as needed 

 

our mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining ore processing and related support facilities our operations in north and south america are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant continuous production at our mines is dependent on our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and defeat claims adverse to our current water uses in legal proceedings 

in north america under state law our water rights give us only the right to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location in arizona we are a participant in two active general stream adjudications in which for 30 years the state of arizona has been attempting to quantify and prioritize surface water claims in two of the state’s largest river systems that include three of our operating mines morenci sierrita and safford and which may also affect our bagdad mine in arizona groundwater is not subject to adjudication in arizona but is subject to the doctrine of reasonable use which requires balancing the utility of the use against the gravity of the harm to others who have rights in the same aquifer however wells may be subject to adjudication to the extent they are found to produce or affect surface water in colorado our surface water and groundwater rights are subject to adjudication and we are involved in legal proceedings to resolve disputes regarding priority of administration of rights including priority of some of our rights for the climax mine our surface water and groundwater rights are fully licensed or have been fully adjudicated in new mexico 

in south america water for our mining operations at candelaria and ojos del salado is drawn from the copiapó river aquifer because of rapid depletion of this aquifer in recent years ongoing studies are addressing the adequacy of this water supply for our mining operations planned at these sites water for our cerro verde processing operations comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs rainfall in 2008 was below normal and the rainy season in 2009 which ends in march has thus far been below normal reservoirs are currently about half of the last fiveyear average for this time of year 

although we believe our mining operations have sufficient water rights the loss of water rights for any of our mines in whole or in part or shortages of water to which we have rights could require us to curtail or shut down mining operations additionally we have not yet secured adequate water rights to support all of our potential expansion projects and our inability to secure those rights could prevent us from pursuing some of those expansion opportunities see item 1a “risk factors” 

competition 

 

we are one of the world’s largest copper gold and molybdenum mining companies in terms of reserves and production with respect to copper which generated approximately 76 percent of our mining revenues in 2008 the top 10 producers comprise approximately 55 percent of total worldwide mined copper production we currently rank second among those producers at approximately 10 percent of total worldwide estimated mined copper production our competitive position is based on the quality and grade of our ore bodies and our ability to manage costs compared with other producers we have a diverse portfolio of mining operations with varying ore grades and cost structures our costs are driven by the location grade and nature of our ore bodies and the input costs including energy labor and equipment the metals markets are cyclical and our ability to maintain our competitive position over the long term is based on our ability to acquire and develop quality deposits hire and retain a skilled workforce and to manage our costs 

labor matters 

at december 31 2008 we employed approximately 29300 people additionally there are approximately 10300 contractor employees working at our grasberg minerals district and approximately 400 contractor employees at atlantic copper employees represented by unions are listed below with the approximate number of employees represented and the expiration date of the applicable union agreements 

 

 

 

fm services company fm services a wholly owned subsidiary of fcx furnishes certain executive administrative financial accounting legal tax and similar services to us as of december 31 2008 fm services had 184 employees fm services employees also provide these services to two other publicly traded companies 

environmental and reclamation matters 

the costs of complying with environmental laws is a fundamental and substantial cost of our business for information about environmental regulation litigation and related costs please see item 1a “risk factors  environmental risks” item 3 “legal proceedings” note 1 – “summary of significant accounting policies  environmental expenditures and asset retirement obligations” and note 15 – “contingencies  environmental and asset retirement obligations” 

community and human rights 

we have adopted policies that govern our working relationships with the communities where we operate that are designed to guide our practices and programs in a manner that respects basic human rights and the culture of the local people impacted by our operations we continue to make significant expenditures on community development education training and cultural programs which include 

·   comprehensive job training programs 

·   basic education programs 

·   public health programs including malaria control 

·   agricultural assistance programs 

·   small and medium enterprise development programs 

·   cultural preservation programs 

·     water and sewage treatment projects 

·     clean water access 

·   charitable donations 

in december 2000 we endorsed the joint us state departmentbritish foreign office voluntary principles on human rights and security “voluntary principles” several major natural resources companies and international human rights organizations participated in developing the voluntary principles and have endorsed them we participated in developing these principles and they are incorporated into our human rights policy 

we believe that our social and economic development programs are responsive to the issues raised by the local communities near our areas of operation and should help us maintain good relations with the surrounding communities and avoid disruptions of mining operations nevertheless social and political instability in the area 

 

may adversely impact our mining operations see item 1a – “risk factors” 

south america cerro verde has provided a variety of community support projects over the years during 2006 as a result of discussions with local mayors in the arequipa region cerro verde agreed to contribute to the design and construction of domestic water and sewage treatment plants for the benefit of the region these facilities are being designed in a modular fashion so that initial installations can be readily expanded in the future we have funded approximately 150 million peruvian nuevo soles approximately 49 million as of december 31 2008 to a designated bank account to be used for financing cerro verde’s share of the construction costs of these facilities 

during 2006 the peruvian government announced that all mining companies operating in peru will make annual contributions to local development funds for a fiveyear period when copper prices exceed certain levels that are adjusted annually the contribution is equal to 375 percent of aftertax profits of which 275 percent is contributed to a local mining fund and 100 percent to a regional mining fund cerro verde’s contributions totaled 28 million in 2008 and 49 million in 2007 

indonesia in 1996 pt freeport indonesia established the freeport partnership fund for community development formerly the freeport fund for irian jaya development through which pt freeport indonesia has made available funding and technical assistance to support the economic health education and social development of the area pt freeport indonesia has committed through 2011 to provide one percent of its annual revenue for the development of the local people in its area of operation through the partnership fund our share of contributions to the partnership fund totaled 34 million in 2008 48 million in 2007 and 44 million in 2006 our joint venture partner rio tinto also contributes to this fund and including their share the contributions totaled 35 million in 2008 53 million in 2007 and 48 million in 2006 

the amungme and kamoro community development organization  lembaga pembangunan masyarakat amungme dan kamoro   or lpmak oversees disbursement of the program funds we contribute to the partnership fund lpmak is governed by a board of commissioners and a board of directors which are comprised of representatives from the local amungme and kamoro tribal communities government leaders church leaders and one representative of ptfi on each board the amungme and kamoro people are original inhabitants of the land in our area of operations 

security matters in indonesia    consistent with our cow in indonesia and the requirement to protect our employees and property we have taken appropriate steps to provide a safe and secure working environment as part of its security program pt freeport indonesia maintains its own internal security department which performs functions such as protecting company facilities monitoring the shipment of company goods through the airport and terminal assisting in traffic control and aiding rescue operations pt freeport indonesia’s civilian security employees numbering approximately 750 are unarmed and perform duties consistent with their internal security role pt freeport indonesia’s share of costs for its internal civilian security department totaled approximately 22 million for 2008 17 million for 2007 and 14 million for 2006 the security department has received human rights training and each member is required to certify his or her compliance with our human rights policy 

pt freeport indonesia and all businesses and residents of indonesia rely on the government of indonesia for the maintenance of public order upholding the rule of law and the protection of personnel and property the grasberg minerals district has been designated by the government of indonesia as one of indonesia’s vital national assets this designation results in the police and to a lesser extent the military playing a significant role in protecting the area of our operations the government of indonesia is responsible for employing police and military personnel and directing their operations 

from the outset of pt freeport indonesia’s operations the government has looked to pt freeport indonesia to provide logistical and infrastructure support and assistance for these necessary services because of the limited resources of the indonesian government and the remote location of and lack of development in papua pt freeport indonesia’s financial support for the indonesian government security institutions assigned to the operations area represents a prudent response to its requirements to protect its workforce and property better ensuring that personnel are properly fed and lodged and have the logistical resources to patrol pt freeport indonesia’s roads and secure its operating area in addition provision of such support and oversight is consistent with pt freeport indonesia’s obligations under the cow reflects our philosophy of responsible corporate citizenship and is in keeping with our commitment to pursue practices that will promote human rights 

 

pt freeport indonesia’s share of support costs for the governmentprovided security currently involving approximately 1850 indonesian government security personnel located in the general area of our operations was 8 million for 2008 9 million for 2007 and 9 million for 2006 this supplemental support consists of various infrastructure and other costs such as food housing fuel travel vehicle repairs allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs and community assistance programs conducted by the military and police pt freeport indonesia’s capital costs for associated infrastructure was less than 1 million for each of the three years ended december 31 2008 

as reported in january 2006 we have received and responded to requests from us governmental authorities related to pt freeport indonesia’s support of indonesian security institutions we are cooperating fully with these requests 

africa tenke fungurume has committed to assist the communities living within its concession in the katanga province of the drc initiatives that have commenced over the past two years include the building of two schools and the remodeling of a third development of over 30 community water wells construction of roads implementation of a malaria control program agricultural support programs to local farmers and support for the development of local small and medium enterprises additionally we have committed to contribute a portion of net sales revenue from production to a community development fund to assist the local communities with development of local infrastructure and related services such as those pertaining to health education and economic development this fund will be a platform to work jointly with the local government and community to further assist them to fulfill their local development plans meet basic community needs and promote good governance 

similar to our operations in indonesia tenke fungurume is required to engage government security institutions to assist with security matters at its concession area in this regard tenke fungurume provides food housing monetary allowances and logistical support as well as direct payments to the government for the provision of the security assigned to the concession area 

 

ore reserves 

recoverable proven and probable reserves summarized below and detailed on the following pages have been calculated as of december 31 2008 in accordance with industry guide 7 as required by the securities and exchange act of 1934 proven and probable reserves may not be comparable to similar information regarding mineral reserves disclosed in accordance with the guidance of other countries proven and probable reserves were determined by the use of mapping drilling sampling assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry as more fully discussed below the term “reserve” as used in the reserve data presented here means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination the term “proven reserves” means reserves for which 1 quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops trenches workings or drill holes 2 grade andor quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and 3 the sites for inspection sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established the term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced the degree of assurance although lower than that for proven reserves is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 

our reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies we conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk we revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies our estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves are prepared by and are the responsibility of our employees and a majority of these estimates are reviewed and verified by independent experts in mining geology and reserve determination estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves were determined using longterm average prices of 160 per pound for copper 550 per ounce for gold 800 per pound for molybdenum 1200 per ounce for silver and 1000 per pound for cobalt the london spot metal prices for the past three years averaged 315 per pound for copper and 724 per ounce for gold and molybdenum prices for the past three years averaged approximately 28 per pound 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in defining our openpit reserves we apply a “variable cutoff grade” strategy the objective of this strategy is to maximize the net present value of our operations we use a breakeven cutoff grade to define the insitu reserves for our underground ore bodies the breakeven cutoff grade is defined for a metric ton of ore as that equivalent copper grade once produced and sold that generates sufficient revenue to cover all operating and administrative costs associated with our production 

our copper mines may contain other commercially recoverable metals such as gold molybdenum silver and cobalt we value all commercially recoverable metals in terms of a copper equivalent percentage to determine a single breakeven cutoff grade copper equivalent percentage is used to express the relative value of multimetal ores in terms of one metal the calculation expresses the relative value of the ore using estimates of contained metal quantities metals prices as used for reserve determination recovery rates treatment charges and royalties our molybdenum properties use a molybdenum cutoff grade the table below shows the minimum cutoff grade by process for each of our existing ore bodies as of december 31 2008 

 

 

drill hole spacing data is used by mining professionals such as geologists and geological engineers in determining the suitability of data coverage on a relative basis in a given deposit type and mining method scenario so as to achieve a given level of confidence in the resource estimate drill hole spacing is only one of several criteria necessary to establish resource classification drilling programs are typically designed to achieve an optimum sample spacing to support the level of confidence in results that apply to a particular stage of development of a mineral deposit the following table sets forth the average drill hole spacing for proven and probable ore reserves by process type 

 

 

the following chart illustrates our current plans for sequencing and producing the december 31 2008 proven and probable reserves at each of our ore bodies and the years in which we currently expect production of each ore body to begin and end the chart also shows the term of pt freeport indonesia’s cow production volumes are typically lower in the first few years for each ore body as development activities are ongoing and as the mine ramps up to full production and production volumes may also be lower as the mine reaches the end of its life the ultimate timing of the start of production from our undeveloped mines is dependent upon a number of factors including the results of our exploration and development efforts and may vary from the dates shown below in addition we develop our mine plans based on maximizing the net present value from the ore bodies 

 

 

 

mill and leach stockpiles 

mill and leach stockpiles generally contain lowergrade ores that have been extracted from the ore body and are available for copper recovery for mill stockpiles recovery is through milling concentrating smelting and refining or alternatively by concentrate leaching for leach stockpiles recovery is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities 

because it is generally impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count reasonable estimation methods are employed the quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grades of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles 

expected copper recovery rates for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing the recoverable copper in mill stockpiles once entered into the production process can be extracted into copper concentrate almost immediately 

expected copper recovery rates for leach stockpiles are determined using smallscale laboratory tests small to largescale column testing which simulates the productionscale process historical trends and other factors including mineralogy of the ore and rock type ultimate recovery of copper contained in leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low percentage to more than 90 percent depending on several variables including type of copper recovery mineralogy and particle size of the rock for newly placed material on active stockpiles as much as 70 percent of the copper ultimately recoverable may be extracted during the first year and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years 

processes and recovery rates are monitored continuously and recovery rate estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes 

following are our stockpiles and the estimated recoverable copper contained within those stockpiles as of december 31 2008 

 

 

 

mineralized material 

we hold various properties containing mineralized material that we believe could be brought into production should market conditions warrant however permitting and significant capital expenditures would be required before operations could commence at these properties mineralized material is a mineralized body that has been delineated by appropriately spaced drilling andor underground sampling to support the reported tonnage and average metal grades such a deposit may not qualify as recoverable proven and probable reserves until legal and economic feasibility are confirmed based upon a comprehensive evaluation of development costs unit costs grades recoveries and other material factors estimated mineralized materials as presented on the following page were assessed using prices of 200 per pound of copper 750 per ounce of gold and 1200 per pound of molybdenum at these prices mineralized material totals 120 billion metric tons on a consolidated basis using a copper price of 160 per pound estimated mineralized material on a consolidated basis would approximate 39 billion metric tons with an average copper grade of 056 percent

financial risks 

extended declines in the market prices of copper gold andor molybdenum could continue to adversely affect our earnings and cash flows and if sustained could eventually adversely affect our ability to repay debt fluctuations in the market prices of copper gold and molybdenum can cause significant volatility in our financial performance and can adversely affect the trading prices of our debt and equity securities 

our earnings and cash flows are affected significantly by the market prices of copper and to a lesser extent gold and molybdenum the world market prices of these commodities have fluctuated historically and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control copper prices have declined significantly from their recent historically high levels exchange inventories have increased significantly since the first half of 2008 after averaging 361 per pound for the first nine months of 2008 london metal exchange lme spot copper prices declined to a fouryear low of 126 per pound in december 2008 and the lme spot copper price closed at 141 per pound on january 30 2009 the price of molybdenum averaging approximately 33 per pound for the first nine months of 2008 declining to a fouryear low of 875 per pound in november 2008 and was 930 per pound on january 30 2009 gold prices averaged approximately 872 per ounce for 2008 and closed at 920 per ounce on january 30 2009 an extended decline in the market price of these commodities could 1 adversely affect our earnings and cash flows 2 adversely affect our ability to repay our debt and meet our other fixed obligations and 3 depress the trading prices of our common and preferred stock and of our publicly traded debt securities 

in addition substantially all of our copper concentrate sales and some of our copper cathode sales are provisionally priced at the time of shipment subject to final pricing at a specified future date based on lme or new york merchantile exchange comex prices on that date accordingly in times of falling copper prices our revenues during a quarter are negatively affected by lower prices received for sales priced at current market rates and also from a decrease related to the final pricing of provisionally priced sales in prior periods 

if the market prices for the metals we produce fall below our production costs for a sustained period of time we may have to further revise our operating plans including further curtailing production reducing operating costs and capital expenditures and discontinuing certain exploration and development programs we may be unable to decrease our costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues and may incur losses 

world copper prices have historically fluctuated widely during the three years ended december 31 2008 lme daily closing spot prices ranged from 126 to 408 per pound for copper world copper prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

world gold prices have historically fluctuated widely during the three years ended december 31 2008 the daily closing prices on the london spot market ranged from 525 to 1011 per ounce for gold world gold prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

molybdenum prices also fluctuate widely molybdenum demand depends primarily on the global steel industry which uses the metal as a hardening and corrosion inhibiting agent approximately 80 percent of molybdenum production is used in this application the remainder is used in specialty chemical applications such as catalysts water treatment agents and lubricants approximately 50 percent of global molybdenum production is a byproduct of copper mining which is relatively insensitive to molybdenum prices decreased demand for molybdenum during the fourth quarter of 2008 resulted in a sudden and sharp decline in molybdenum prices during the three years ended december 31 2008 the metals week dealer oxide weekly average price for molybdenum ranged from 875 to 3388 per pound molybdenum prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the agreements governing our indebtedness require us to meet certain financial tests and other covenants and as a result may limit our flexibility in the operation of our business and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 

we incurred significant debt to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid to acquire phelps dodge as of december 31 2008 the outstanding principal amount of our indebtedness was 74 billion the agreements governing our indebtedness restrict subject to certain exceptions our ability to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition our senior credit facilities require that we meet certain financial tests at any time that borrowings are outstanding under our revolving credit facility including a leverage ratio test total debt to consolidated ebitda as those terms are defined in the facility for the preceding four quarters cannot exceed 50 to 10 on the last day of any fiscal quarter and a secured leverage ratio test total secured debt to consolidated ebitda as those terms are defined in the facility for the preceding four quarters cannot exceed 30 to 10 on the last day of any fiscal quarter during periods in which copper gold or molybdenum prices or production volumes or other conditions reflect the adverse impact of cyclical market trends or other factors we may not be able to comply with the applicable financial covenants 

our senior credit facilities the 60 billion 825 8375 and floating rate senior notes and the 6⅞ senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability to make certain payments these restrictions vary among the instruments but generally limit our ability to pay certain dividends on common and preferred stock repurchase or redeem common and preferred equity prepay subordinated debt and make certain investments at december 31 2008 the most restrictive of these covenants allowed for such payments up to a limit that exceeded 5 billion 

our obligations under our senior credit facilities are i guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries and ii secured by a pledge of a 100 percent of the equity in substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries and b 665 percent of the equity in substantially all of our first tier foreign subsidiaries 

any failure to comply with the restrictions of our senior credit facilities senior notes or any agreement governing our other indebtedness after giving effect to any applicable grace period may result in an event of default such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt which may trigger crossacceleration or crossdefault provisions in other debt agreements our assets and cash flow would not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our debt instruments that are accelerated upon an event of default 

if we are unable to repay refinance or restructure our indebtedness under or amend the covenants contained in our senior credit agreements at maturity or in the event of a default the lenders under our senior credit facilities could terminate their commitments thereunder cease making further loans declare all borrowings outstanding together with accrued interest and other fees immediately due and payable and institute foreclosure proceedings against the security any such actions could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

 

under us federal and state laws that require closure and reclamation plans for our mines we are required to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement those plans if we are unable to do so the us environmental protection agency epa and state agencies may seek financial assurance for investigation and remediation actions taken under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or equivalent state regulations    the failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

we are required by us federal and state laws to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans if we are unable to do so these laws are complex and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction the laws govern the determination of the scope and cost of the closure and reclamation obligations and the amount and forms of financial assurance 

 

as of december 31 2008 our financial assurance obligations associated with closure and reclamation costs totaled approximately 715 million of which approximately 425 million was in the form of parent company guarantees and financial capability demonstrations our ability to continue to provide financial assurance in the form of parent guarantees and financial capability demonstrations in new mexico and arizona depends on our ability to meet financial tests certain of the ratios in these tests are significantly more rigorous for companies that do not have an investment grade rating from a stateapproved ratings service we are currently rated investment grade by standard  poor’s and fitch but are not rated investment grade by moody’s if we fail to maintain our investment grade rating we would be subject to these alternate tests and as a result the regulatory agencies may require us to provide alternative forms of financial assurance to fully satisfy our financial assurance obligations such as letters of credit surety bonds or collateral depending on our financial condition and market conditions these other forms of financial assurance may be difficult or costly to provide issuance of letters of credit under our credit facilities would reduce our available liquidity failure to provide the required financial assurance could result in the closure of mines as of december 31 2008 we have limited financial assurance obligations associated with cerclarelated actions although epa and certain states are currently considering increasing the use of financial assurance requirements   for additional information see the risk factor “mine closure regulations impose substantial costs on our operations” below 

 

we need significant amounts of cash to service our debt if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to service our debt our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected 

we must generate sufficient amounts of cash to service and repay our debt our ability to generate cash will be affected by general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control future borrowings may not be available to us under our senior credit facilities or from the capital markets in amounts sufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund other liquidity needs if we are not able to obtain such borrowings or generate sufficient cash from operations to service and repay our indebtedness we will need to refinance our indebtedness to avoid any default such refinancing may not be available on favorable terms or at all the inability to service repay or refinance our indebtedness could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our indebtedness as well as the current global recession disruption in financial markets and lower copper andor molybdenum prices generally could among other things impede our access to capital or increase our cost of capital which would have an adverse effect on our ability to fund our working capital and other capital requirements 

as of december 31 2008 the outstanding principal amount of our debt was approximately 74 billion the widely reported domestic and global recession the associated low copper and molybdenum prices and the unprecedented levels of disruption and continuing illiquidity in the credit markets have had an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and if sustained or worsened such adverse effects could continue or worsen disruptions in the credit and financial markets have adversely affected financial institutions inhibited lending and limited access to capital and credit for many companies including ours these disruptions have made it difficult for us to obtain or increase our cost of obtaining capital and financing for our operations and have limited our flexibility to plan for or react to changes in our business and the markets in which we operate if these conditions persist or worsen they could among other things make it difficult for us to finance our working capital requirements and service our existing debt 

if future financing is not available to us when required as a result of limited access to the credit markets or 

 

otherwise or is not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to invest needed capital for our development and exploration programs take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures any of which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition

 

movements in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates could negatively affect our operating results 

substantially all of our revenues and a significant portion of our costs are denominated in us dollars however some of our costs and certain of our asset and liability accounts are denominated in indonesian rupiah chilean pesos peruvian nuevos soles australian dollars euros and other foreign currencies as a result we will be generally less profitable when the us dollar weakens in relation to these foreign currencies 

as of december 31 2008 approximately 20 percent of our outstanding debt was subject to variable interest rates increases in these rates will increase our interest costs and reduce our profits and operating cash flows 

from time to time we may implement currency or interest rate hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange or interest rates however our hedging strategies may not be successful and any of our unhedged foreign exchange or interest payments will continue to be subject to market fluctuations 

operational risks 

the volume and grade of ore reserves that we recover and our rate of production may be more or less than anticipated 

our ore reserve amounts are determined in accordance with established mining industry practices and standards and are estimates of the mineral deposits that can be recovered economically and legally based on currently available data estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves are subject to considerable uncertainty ore bodies may not conform to standard geological expectations and estimates may change as new data becomes available because ore bodies do not contain uniform grades and types of minerals our metal recovery rates will vary from time to time 

additionally because the determination of reserves is based partially on estimates of future selling prices a sustained decrease in such prices may result in a reduction in economically recoverable ore reserves these factors may result in variations in the volumes of mineral reserves that we report from period to period 

there are also uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of ore reserves and copper recovered from stockpiles the quantity of copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records the volume and grade of ore reserves recovered rates of production and recovered copper from stockpiles may be less than anticipated 

we must continually replace reserves depleted by production our exploration activities may not result in additional discoveries 

our ability to replenish our ore reserves is important to our longterm viability produced ore reserves must be replaced by further delineation of existing ore bodies or by locating new deposits in order to maintain production levels over the long term exploration is highly speculative in nature our exploration projects involve many risks require substantial expenditures and may not result in the discovery of sufficient additional mineral deposits that can be mined profitably once a site with mineralization is discovered it may take several years from the initial phases of drilling until production is possible during which time the economic feasibility of production may change substantial expenditures are required to establish recoverable proven and probable reserves and to construct mining and processing facilities as a result there is no assurance that current or future exploration programs will be successful there is a risk that depletion of reserves will not be offset by discoveries or acquisitions 

our business is subject to operational risks that are generally outside of our control and could adversely affect our business 

mines by their nature are subject to many operational risks and factors that are generally outside of our control and could adversely affect our business operating results and cash flows these operational risks and factors 

 

include the following

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continuation of our mining production is dependent on the availability of a sufficient water supply to support our mining operations 

our mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining ore processing and related support facilities our operations in north and south america are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant continuous production at our mines is dependent on our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and defeat claims adverse to our current water uses in legal proceedings at our us operations under state law our water rights give us only the right to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location in arizona we are a participant in two active general stream adjudications in which for over 30 years the state of arizona has been attempting to quantify and prioritize surface water claims in two of the state’s largest river systems that include three of our operating mines morenci sierrita and safford and which may also affect our arizona mine at bagdad groundwater is not subject to adjudication in arizona but is subject to the doctrine of reasonable use which requires balancing the utility of the use against the gravity of the harm to others who have rights in the same aquifer however wells may be subject to adjudication to the extent they are found to produce or affect surface water in colorado our surface water and groundwater rights are subject to adjudication and we are involved in legal proceedings to resolve disputes regarding priority of administration of rights including priority of some of our rights for the climax mine our surface water and groundwater rights are fully licensed or have been fully adjudicated in new mexico 

in south america water for our mining operations at candelaria and ojos del salado is drawn from the copiapo river aquifer because of rapid depletion of this aquifer in recent years ongoing studies are addressing the adequacy of this water supply for our mining operations at these sites and a project to pump effluent from a nearby sewerage treatment plant as an alternate water source is being explored at el abra regulatory agencies continue to evaluate the potential hydrologic and ecologic effects from our groundwater pumping at the salar de

although each operation currently has sufficient water rights and claims to cover its operational demands we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings on our water rights claims and uses the loss of some or all water rights for any of our mines in whole or in part or shortages of water to which we have rights could require us to curtail or shut down mining production and could prevent us from pursuing expansion opportunities additionally we have not yet secured adequate water rights to support all of our potential expansion projects and our inability to secure those rights could prevent us from pursuing some of those opportunities 

an interruption of energy supply could adversely affect our mining operations 

our mining operations and development projects require significant amounts of energy our principal energy sources are electricity purchased petroleum products natural gas and coal our south america mining operations receive electrical power under longterm contracts with local energy companies our africa development project tenke fungurume has entered into longterm power supply and infrastructure funding agreements with the stateowned electric utility company serving the katanga province of the democratic republic of congo a disruption in the transmission of energy inadequate energy transmission infrastructure or the termination of any of our energy supply contracts could interrupt our energy supply and adversely affect our operations 

increased production costs could reduce our profitability and cash flow 

energy represents a significant portion of our production costs an inability to procure sufficient energy at reasonable prices could adversely affect our profits cash flow and growth opportunities our production costs are also affected by the prices of commodities we consume or use in our operations such as sulfuric acid grinding media steel reagents liners explosives and diluents the prices of such commodities are influenced by supply and demand trends affecting the mining industry in general and other factors outside our control and such prices are at times subject to volatile movements although our cash costs increased significantly in 2008 principally for energy and sulfuric acid these costs began to decrease in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of the recent sharp declines in prices of energy steel and sulfuric acid future increases in the cost of these commodities could make our operations less profitable increases in the costs of commodities that we consume or use may also significantly affect the capital costs of new projects 

in addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry our indonesia operations involve additional risks because they are located on unusually difficult terrain in a very remote area 

our grasberg mining operations are located in steep mountainous terrain in a very remote area in indonesia because of these conditions we have had to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities in addition the area receives considerable rainfall which has led to periodic floods and mudslides the mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time our insurance may not sufficiently cover an unexpected natural or operating disaster 

on october 9 2003 a slippage of material occurred in a section of the grasberg open pit resulting in eight fatalities on december 12 2003 a debris flow involving a relatively small amount of loose material occurred in the same section of the open pit resulting in only minor property damage the events caused us to alter our shortterm mine sequencing plans which adversely affected our 2003 and 2004 production we resumed normal production activities in the second quarter of 2004 

on march 23 2006 a mudtopsoil slide involving approximately 75000 metric tons of material occurred from a mountain ridge above service facilities supporting pt freeport indonesia’s mining facilities regrettably three contract workers were fatally injured in the event the material damaged a mess hall and an adjacent area as a result of investigations by pt freeport indonesia and the indonesian department of energy and mineral resources we conducted geotechnical studies to identify and address any potential hazards to workers and facilities from slides the existing early warning system for potential slides based upon rainfall and other factors has also been expanded 

 

 

on september 10 2008 a small scale failure encompassing approximately 75000 metric tons of material occurred at our grasberg open pit there were no injuries or property damage the event caused a delay in our access to the highgrade section of the open pit and as a result a portion of the metal expected to be mined in the second half of 2008 was deferred to future periods

no assurance can be given that similar events will not occur in the future 

development projects are inherently risky and may require more capital than anticipated which could adversely affect our business in addition our most significant development project tenke fungurume is located in a remote area of the democratic republic of congo 

there are many risks and uncertainties inherent in all development projects including our significant future development of underground mines at the grasberg minerals district and our tenke fungurume project the economic feasibility of development projects is based on many factors including the accuracy of estimated reserves metallurgical recoveries capital and operating costs and future prices of the relevant minerals the capital expenditures and time required to develop new mines or other projects are considerable and changes in costs or construction schedules can affect project economics thus it is possible that actual costs and economic returns may differ materially from our estimates 

new development projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future cash flow these development projects also require the successful completion of feasibility studies acquisition of governmental permits acquisition of land power and water and ensuring that appropriate community infrastructure is developed by third parties to support such projects it is possible that we could fail to obtain the government approvals necessary for the operation of a project in which case the project may not proceed either on its original timing or at all it is not unusual for new mining operations to experience unexpected problems during the startup phase resulting in delays in producing revenue and increases in invested capital 

our tenke fungurume project is located in a remote area of the democratic republic of congo and is subject to additional challenges due to 

 

 

 

 

consequently our tenke fungurume development project may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control which could increase the cost of the project and adversely affect its ultimate contribution to our operating results 

environmental risks 

our domestic and international operations are subject to complex and evolving environmental laws and regulations and compliance with environmental and regulatory requirements involves significant costs 

our ongoing mining operations and exploration activities both in the us and elsewhere are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing exploration development production occupational health mine safety toxic substances waste disposal protection and remediation of the environment protection of endangered and protected species and other related matters compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs and we expect these costs to continue to increase in the future because of increased regulatory enforcement increased demand for remediation services and shortages of equipment supplies labor and other factors the federal clean air act has had a significant impact particularly on our domestic smelter and power plants any change in waste management regulation of the mining industry under the federal resource conservation and recovery act could have a significant impact both on operational compliance and closure costs in addition environmental laws and regulations may change in ways that could adversely affect our operations or expansion opportunities 

 

in addition to compliance with environmental regulation at our operating sites we incur significant costs for remediating environmental conditions on properties that have not been operated in many years 

phelps dodge corporation now named freeportmcmoran corporation and many of its affiliates and predecessor companies have been involved in mining milling and manufacturing in the us for more than a century activities that occurred in the late 19th century and the 20th century prior to the advent of modern environmental laws were not subject to environmental regulation and were conducted before american industrial companies understood the longterm effects of their operations on the surrounding environment with the passage of cercla in 1980 companies like phelps dodge became legally responsible for environmental remediation on properties previously owned or operated by them irrespective of when the damage to the environment occurred or who caused it that liability is often shared on a joint and several basis with all other owners and operators meaning that each owner or operator of the property is fully responsible for the cleanup although in many cases some or all of the other historical owners or operators no longer exist do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found as a result because of our acquisition of phelps dodge in 2007 many of the subsidiary companies we now own are responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the us and we expect to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address these remediation issues we are also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources as of december 31 2008 we had more than 100 active remediation projects in the us in approximately 25 states 

we incurred aggregate environmental capital expenditure and other environmental costs including joint venture partners’ share totaling 468 million in 2008 320 million in 2007 and 63 million in 2006 refer to note 15 – “contingencies” for more information on our environmental liabilities 

an adverse ruling in one or more pending legal proceedings involving environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on us 

as described in our securities and exchange commission sec filings we are a defendant in numerous and in some cases significant litigation involving environmental cleanup costs alleged environmental toxic torts and interpretations of environmental regulations an adverse ruling in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

 

mine closure regulations impose substantial costs on our operations 

 

our domestic operations are subject to various federal and state permitting requirements that include mine closure and minedland reclamation obligations these requirements are complex and vary depending upon the jurisdiction the laws govern the determination of the scope and cost of the closure and reclamation obligations and the amount and forms of financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to meet the obligations of those plans if we are unable to do so in general our domestic mines are required to review estimated closure and reclamation costs on either a periodic basis or at the time of significant permit modifications and post increasing amounts of financial assurance as required 

 

in addition our international mines are subject to various mine closure and minedland reclamation laws and there have recently been significant changes in closure and reclamation programs in both peru and chile that impose more stringent obligations on us for closure and reclamation updated closure plans for our three chilean operations were submitted to the government in february 2009 

 

our asset retirement obligations as of december 31 2008 determined as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 143 “asset retirement obligations” totaled approximately 712 million including approximately 42 million for the current portion at december 31 2008 we had accrued reclamation and closure costs of 372 million for our new mexico operations 164 million for our arizona operations and 83 million for pt freeport indonesia asset retirement obligation cost estimates may increase or decrease significantly in the future as a result of changes in regulations engineering designs and technology permit modifications or updates mine plans cost of inflation or other factors and as actual reclamation spending occurs 

 

 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions effects and climate change issues may adversely affect our operations and markets 

 

energy is a significant input to our mining and processing operations our principal energy sources are electricity purchased petroleum products natural gas and coal many scientists believe that emissions from the combustion of carbonbased fuels contribute to greenhouse effects and therefore potentially to climate change 

a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change the december 1997 kyoto protocol established a set of greenhouse gas emission targets for developed countries that have ratified the protocol although the kyoto protocol has not been ratified by the us several states have initiated legislative action on climate change climate change legislation has been introduced in but not yet passed by the us congress many believe that federal climate change legislation is very likely to become effective in the next few years which will result in increased future energy and compliance costs from a medium and longterm perspective we are likely to see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit significant amounts of greenhouse gases as a result of regulatory initiatives in the us and other countries in which we operate these regulatory initiatives will be either voluntary or mandatory and may impact our operations directly or through our suppliers or customers assessments of the potential impact of future climate change regulation are uncertain given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which we operate 

the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would be particular to the geographic circumstances these may include changes in rainfall patterns water shortages changing sea levels changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperatures these effects may adversely impact the cost production and financial performance of our operations 

our operating inactive and historical domestic mining sites and facilities may be subject to future regulation of radioactive materials that are commonly associated with or result from our mining operations 

a number of federal and state agencies are considering new regulations to characterize regulate and remediate potential workplace exposures and environmental impacts of radioactive materials commonly associated with mining operations for example the epa could promulgate rules to regulate technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive materials tenorm and their impacts at mining operations in addition several states are promulgating groundwater quality compliance and remediation standards for radioactive materials including uranium radioactive materials can be associated with copper mineral deposits including both our current and discontinued operations consequently our copper operations may generate concentrate or release radioactive materials that may subject our operations to new and increased regulation the impact of such future regulation on our operating closure reclamation and remediation costs is uncertain 

our mining operations in indonesia create difficult and costly environmental challenges and future changes in environmental laws or unanticipated environmental impacts from those operations could require us to incur increased costs 

mining operations on the scale of our operations in papua involve significant environmental risks and challenges our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of crushed and ground rock material called tailings that results from the process by which we physically separate the copper gold and silverbearing materials from the ore that we mine our tailings management plan which has been approved by the government of indonesia uses the river system near our mine to transport the tailings to the lowlands where the tailings and natural sediments are deposited in a controlled area contained within an engineered levee system that will be revegetated 

another major environmental challenge is managing overburden which is the rock that must be moved aside in the mining process in order to reach the ore in the presence of air water and naturally occurring bacteria some overburden can cause acid rock drainage or acidic water containing dissolved metals which if not properly managed can have a negative impact on the environment 

certain indonesian governmental officials have from time to time raised issues with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans including a suggestion that we implement a pipeline system rather than our river deposition system for tailings disposal because our mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous 

 

terrain and in an active seismic area a pipeline system would be costly difficult to construct and maintain and more prone to catastrophic failure and could therefore involve significant potentially adverse environmental issues based on our own studies and others conducted by third parties we do not believe that a pipeline system is necessary or practical 

in connection with obtaining our environmental approvals from the indonesian government we committed to perform a onetime environmental risk assessment on the impacts of our tailings management plan we completed this extensive environmental risk assessment with more than 90 scientific studies conducted over four years and submitted it to the indonesian government in december 2002 we developed the risk assessment study with input from an independent review panel which included representatives from the indonesian government academia and nongovernmental organizations the risks that we identified during this process were in line with our impact projections of the tailings management program contained in our environmental approval documents 

in 2005 pt freeport indonesia agreed to participate in the government of indonesia’s proper program for pollution control evaluation and rating program in march 2006 the indonesian ministry of environment announced the preliminary results of its proper environmental management audit acknowledging the effectiveness of pt freeport indonesia’s environmental management practices in some areas while making several suggestions for improvement in others 

international risks 

our operations outside of the us are subject to political social and geographic risks of doing business in foreign countries 

we are a global mining company with substantial assets located outside of the us we conduct international mining operations in indonesia chile and peru we also have a significant development project in the democratic republic of congo which is expected to begin production in 2009 accordingly our business may be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties in each of these countries in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in foreign countries such risks include 1 forced modification of existing contracts 2 expropriation 3 changes in a country’s laws and policies including those relating to labor taxation royalties divestment imports exports trade regulations currency and environmental matters 4 political instability and civil strife 5 exchange controls and 6 the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel or having to enforce the judgment of a foreign court or arbitration panel against a sovereign nation within its own territory our insurance does not cover most losses caused by these risks 

in december 2008 we were notified by peruvian tax authorities of their intent to assess mining royalties related to the minerals processed by the cerro verde concentrator the amount claimed to be due through december 2007 is approximately 33 million we believe our royalty obligations with respect to all minerals extracted at cerro verde are subject to our existing stability agreement regardless of the processing method applied after extraction and believe that cerro verde owes no royalties with respect to minerals processed through our concentrator we intend to work cooperatively with the authorities in peru to resolve this matter 

because our grasberg minerals district in papua indonesia remains our most significant operating asset our business may continue to be adversely affected by indonesian political economic and social uncertainties 

indonesia has faced political economic and social uncertainties including separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces in particular several separatist groups are opposing indonesian rule over the province of papua where our grasberg minerals district is located and have sought political independence for the province in response indonesia enacted regional autonomy laws which became effective january 1 2001 the manner in which the new laws are being implemented and the degree of political and economic autonomy that they may bring to individual provinces including papua are uncertain and are ongoing issues in indonesian politics in papua there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the indonesian military social economic and political instability in papua could materially and adversely affect us if it results in damage to our property or interruption of our activities 

 

 

maintaining a good working relationship with the indonesian government is important to us because our mining operations there are among indonesia’s most significant business enterprises and are conducted pursuant to a contract of work with the indonesian government partially because of their significance to indonesia’s economy the environmentally sensitive area in which they are located and the number of people employed our operations are occasionally the subject of criticism in the indonesian press and in political debates and have been the target of protests and occasional violence   in october 2004 susilo bambang yudhoyono was elected as president of indonesia in the nations first direct presidential election indonesia has a presidential election scheduled for july 2009 while we intend to continue to maintain positive working relationships with the indonesian government we cannot predict the impact that the 2009 elections will have on our relationships

grasberg operated at reduced mining and milling rates during a fourday period from april 18 2007 to april 21 2007 as a result of peaceful protests by certain workers regarding benefits the protests ended on april 21 with an agreement on a framework for minimum wages for its workers and grasberg returned to normal operations the impacts to production were not significant illegal miners have continued to operate along the river designated to transport the tailings from the mill to the lowlands in pt freeport indonesia’s governmentapproved tailings management area the illegal miners who have trespassed from time to time in the area of our facilities have clashed with police who have attempted to move them away from our facilities in 2006 the illegal miners temporarily blocked the road leading to the grasberg mine and mill in protest and pt freeport indonesia temporarily suspended mining and milling operations as a precautionary measure 

we cannot predict whether additional incidents will occur that could disrupt our indonesian operations or whether similar incidents may occur in other countries that could affect our other operations if additional protests or other disruptive incidents occur at any of our facilities they could adversely affect our business and profitability in ways that we cannot predict at this time 

we do not expect to mine all of our indonesian ore reserves before the initial term of our contract of work in indonesia expires 

all of our indonesian proven and probable ore reserves including the grasberg deposit are located in block a the initial term of our contract of work covering these ore reserves expires at the end of 2021 we can extend this term for two successive 10year periods subject to the approval of the indonesian government which under our contract of work cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably our ore reserves reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041 ie through the expiration of the two 10year extensions and our current mine plan has been developed and our operations are based on the assumption that we will receive the two 10year extensions as a result we will not mine all of these ore reserves during the current term of our contract of work and there can be no assurance that the indonesian government will approve the extensions prior to the end of 2021 we expect to mine approximately 35 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable ore at december 31 2008 representing approximately 42 percent of pt freeport indonesia’s share of recoverable copper reserves and approximately 56 percent of its share of recoverable gold reserves 

our contracts of work in indonesia are subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations and if a dispute arises we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel 

pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work and other contracts of work in which we have an interest were entered into under indonesia’s 1967 foreign capital investment law which provides guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization our contracts of work can be terminated by the government of indonesia if we do not satisfy our contractual obligations which include the payment of royalties and taxes to the government and the satisfaction of certain mining environmental safety and health requirements 

at times certain government officials and others in indonesia have questioned the validity of contracts entered into by the government of indonesia prior to may 1998 ie during the suharto regime which lasted over 30 years including pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work which was signed in december 1991 we cannot assure you that the validity of or our compliance with the contracts of work will not be challenged for political or other reasons pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work and our other contracts of work require that disputes with the indonesian government be submitted to international arbitration consequently if a dispute arises under the contracts of work we face the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel and if we prevail in such a dispute we will face the additional risk of having to enforce the judgment of a foreign court or arbitration panel against indonesia within its own territory 

 

indonesian government officials have periodically undertaken reviews regarding our compliance with indonesian environmental laws and regulations and the terms of the contracts of work in 2006 the government of indonesia created a joint team for “periodic evaluation on implementation of the ptfi contract of work cow” to conduct an evaluation every five years the team consists of five working groups whose members are from relevant ministries or agencies covering production state revenues community development environmental issues and security issues we have conducted numerous meetings with these groups the joint team has indicated that it will issue a report while we believe that we comply with pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work in all material respects we cannot assure you that the report will support that conclusion separately the indonesian house of representatives created a working committee on pt freeport indonesia members of this group have also visited our operations and held a number of hearings in jakarta we will continue to work with these groups to respond to their questions about our operations and our compliance with pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work 

any suspension of required activities under our contracts of work requires the consent of the indonesian government 

our contracts of work permits us to suspend certain contractually required activities including exploration for a period of one year by making a written request to the indonesian government these requests are subject to the approval of the indonesian government and are renewable annually if we do not request a suspension or are denied a suspension then we are required to continue our activities under the contract of work or potentially be declared in default moreover if a suspension continues for more than one year for reasons other than force majeure and the indonesian government has not approved such continuation then the government would be entitled to declare a default under the contract of work 

we suspended our field exploration activities outside of block a in recent years because of safety and security issues and regulatory uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest areas and an indonesian forestry law enacted in 1999 prohibiting openpit mining in forest preservation areas in 2001 we requested and received from the government of indonesia formal temporary suspensions of our obligations under the contracts of work in all areas outside of block a recent indonesian legislation permits openpit mining in pt freeport indonesia’s block b area subject to certain requirements following an assessment of these requirements and a review of security issues in 2007 we resumed exploration activities in certain prospective contract of work areas outside of block a 

our tenke fungurume development project is located in the democratic republic of congo and our business may be adversely affected by political economic and social instability in the democratic republic of congo 

our most significant development project tenke fungurume is located in the democratic republic of congo a nation that since 1960 has undergone outbreaks of political violence changes in national leadership and financial crisis these factors heighten the risk of abrupt changes in the national policy towards foreign investors which in turn could result in unilateral modification of concessions or contracts increased taxation denial of permits or permit renewals or expropriation of assets our ability to continue development is currently subject to an ongoing review of all mining contracts by the ministry of mines ministry in the democratic republic of congo the outcome of which cannot be predicted we received notification on february 20 2008 that the ministry wishes to renegotiate several material provisions of our mining concessions we believe that the terms of the concessions are fair and that they were negotiated transparently and are legally binding however we cannot predict whether the government of the democratic republic of congo will respect our contract rights other political economic and social risks that are outside of our control and could adversely affect our business include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequently our tenke fungurume development project may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control any of which could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 

terrorist attacks throughout the world and the potential for additional future terrorist acts have created economic and political uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business 

on august 31 2002 three people were killed and 11 others were wounded in an ambush by a group of unidentified assailants on the road near tembagapura the mining town where the majority of pt freeport indonesia’s personnel reside the assailants shot at several vehicles transporting international contract teachers from our school in tembagapura their family members and other contractors to pt freeport indonesia the us federal bureau of investigation fbi investigated the incident which resulted in the us indictment of an alleged operational commander of the free papua movementnational freedom force in january 2006 indonesian police accompanied by fbi agents arrested the alleged operational commander and 11 other papuans in november 2006 verdicts and sentencing were announced for seven of those accused in the august 2002 shooting including a life sentence for the confessed leader of the attack 

on october 12 2002 a bombing killed 202 people in the indonesian province of bali which is 1500 miles west of our mining and milling operations indonesian authorities arrested 35 people in connection with this bombing and 29 of those arrested have been tried and convicted on august 5 2003 12 people were killed and over 100 were injured by a car bomb detonated outside of the jw marriott hotel in jakarta indonesia on september 9 2004 11 people were killed and over 200 injured by a car bomb detonated in front of the australian embassy in jakarta on october 1 2005 three suicide bombers killed 19 people and wounded over 100 in bali the same international terrorist organizations are suspected in each of these incidents in november 2005 indonesian police raided a house in east java that resulted in the death of other accused terrorists linked to the bombings discussed above our mining and milling operations were not interrupted by these incidents but pt freeport indonesia’s corporate office in jakarta had to relocate for several months following the bombing in front of the australian embassy in addition to the bali jw marriott hotel and australian embassy bombings there have been antiamerican demonstrations in certain sections of indonesia reportedly led by radical islamic activists 

no assurance can be given that additional terrorist incidents will not occur if there were to be additional violence it could materially and adversely affect our business in ways that we cannot predict at this time 

other risks 

if market prices for our commodities decline the carrying values of inventories and longlived assets may be further impaired which could require charges to operating income that could be material 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we recorded significant charges to reduce the carrying values of inventories and longlived assets and to eliminate goodwill further declines in the market price of copper among other factors may cause us to record additional lower of cost or market inventory adjustments and may also require us to further write down the carrying value of longlived assets which would potentially have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and shareholders equity but would have no effect on cash flows 

unanticipated litigation or negative developments in pending litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are a party to the litigation described in our sec filings and a number of other litigation matters including asbestos exposure cases disputes over the allocation of environmental remediation obligations at superfund and other sites disputes over water rights and disputes with regulatory authorities the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant monetary damages penalties or injunctive relief against us limitations on our property rights or regulatory interpretations that increase our operating costs if any of these disputes results in a substantial monetary judgment against us or an adverse legal interpretation is settled on unfavorable terms or otherwise affects our operations it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

 

we depend on our senior management team and other key employees and the loss of any of these employees could adversely affect our business 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract retain and motivate senior management and other key employees achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions competitors’ hiring practices cost reduction activities and the effectiveness of our compensation programs competition for qualified personnel can be very intense we must continue to recruit retain and motivate senior management and other key employees sufficient to maintain our current business and support our future projects a loss of such personnel could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and our operating results could be adversely affected 

our holding company structure may impact your ability to receive dividends  

we are a holding company with no material assets other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries as a result our ability to repay our indebtedness and pay dividends is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend loan debt repayment or otherwise our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to make funds available to us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends dividends from subsidiaries that are not wholly owned are shared with other equity owners in addition cash at our international operations is subject to foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation into the us 

in addition our subsidiaries may not be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries’ assets upon their liquidation reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries’ creditors including any trade creditors and preferred stockholders 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult these provisions 

 

 

 

 

these provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our board of directors 

in addition because we are incorporated in delaware we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with or acquisition of us 

these provisions may deter an acquisition of us that might otherwise be attractive to stockholders 

 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

not applicable 







 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings of a character normally incident to the ordinary course of our business we believe that potential liability in such proceedings would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations we maintain liability insurance to cover some but not all potential liabilities normally incident to the ordinary course of our business as well as other insurance coverage customary in our business with coverage limits that we deem prudent 

environmental proceedings 

pinal creek   we are a party to pinal creek group et al v newmont mining corporation et al   united states district court district of arizona case no civ 911764 phx dae loa filed on may 1 1991 the pinal creek site located near miami arizona was listed under the arizona department of environmental quality’s adeq water quality assurance revolving fund program in 1989 for contamination in the shallow alluvial aquifers within the pinal creek drainage near miami arizona since that time environmental remediation has been performed by members of the pinal creek group pcg consisting of phelps dodge miami inc miami a wholly owned subsidiary of freeportmcmoran corporation formerly phelps dodge corporation and two other companies in 1998 the district court approved a consent decree between the pcg members and the state of arizona resolving all matters related to an enforcement action contemplated by the state of arizona against the pcg members with respect to groundwater the consent decree committed the pcg members to complete the remediation work outlined in the consent decree that work continues at this time pursuant to the consent decree and consistent with state law and the national contingency plan prepared by the us environmental protection agency epa under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla 

remediation has been proceeding pursuant to an interim allocation of cost sharing among the members of the pcg with miami’s interim allocation being approximately twothirds however there are significant disagreements among the members of the pcg regarding the allocation of the cost of remediation and other members allege that miami should be responsible for substantially all of the costs discovery disputes resulted in a sanctions order against miami that included significant evidentiary restrictions on miami’s case the trial on the allocation issue will be scheduled after the final determination of miami’s pending interlocutory appeal of a trial court ruling on the liability standard that should apply to one of the remaining defendants a final determination of the allocation if different from the interim allocation would likely result in a “true up” payment with respect to the remediation that has already been completed from the party found to be responsible for a higher proportion than the interim allocation and would establish the costsharing proportions for the remainder of the clean up the overall cost of the clean up is expected to be significant 

blackwell oklahoma litigation  on april 14 2008 a purported class action was filed in the district court of kay county oklahoma against us and several direct and indirect subsidiaries including blackwell zinc company bzc and several other parties entitled coffey et al plaintiffs v freeportmcmoran copper  gold inc et al defendants  kay county oklahoma district court case no cj200868 the suit alleges that the operations of bzc’s zinc smelter in blackwell oklahoma from 1918 to 1974 resulted in contamination of the soils and groundwater in blackwell and the surrounding area unspecified compensatory and punitive damages are sought on behalf of the putative class members for alleged diminution in property values there is also a request for an order compelling remediation of alleged contaminated properties and the establishment of a monetary fund to monitor the present and future health of the putative class members we intend to defend this matter vigorously for more information about our remediation activities in blackwell oklahoma refer to note 15 – “contingencies – environmental and asset retirement obligations”

asbestos claims 

since approximately 1990 phelps dodge and various subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a large number of product liability or premises lawsuits claiming injury from exposure to asbestos contained in electrical wire products produced or marketed many years ago or from asbestos at certain phelps dodge properties based on information available to us to date we believe our liability if any in these matters will not have a material adverse effect either individually or in the aggregate upon our business financial condition liquidity results of operations or cash flow there can be no assurance however that future developments will not alter this conclusion 

water rights 

water law in the western us is generally based on the doctrine of prior appropriation first in time first in right and permits the water right holder the right to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location our operations in the western us require water for mining ore processing and related support facilities continuous operation of these mines is dependent on our ability to maintain our water rights and claims the loss of water rights in whole or in part could have a significant adverse affect on our mining operations 

two water rights adjudications have been initiated in the state of arizona in order to quantify and prioritize all surface water claims in two of the state’s river systems that include three of our operating mines morenci sierrita and safford and which may affect our bagdad arizona mine these adjudications have proceeded for many years and we cannot predict when they will be concluded but the loss of water claims in these legal proceedings could have a significant adverse affect on the operations of these mines 

in re the general adjudication of all rights to use water in the little colorado water system and sources  apache county superior court no 6417 filed on or about february 17 1978 the principal parties in addition to us include the state of arizona the salt river project the arizona public service company the navajo nation the hopi indian tribe the san juan southern paiute tribe and the united states on its own behalf on behalf of those indian tribes and on behalf of the white mountain apache tribe 

in re the general adjudication of all rights to use water in the gila river system and sources  

maricopa county superior court cause nos w1 salt w2 verde w3 upper gila and w4 san pedro filed on february 17 1978 the principal parties in addition to us include the state of arizona the gila valley irrigation district the san carlos irrigation and drainage district the salt river project the san carlos apache tribe the gila river indian community and the united states on behalf of those tribes on its own behalf and on behalf of the white mountain apache tribe the fort mcdowell mohaveapache indian community the salt river pimamaricopa indian community and the payson community of yavapai apache indians 

in 1998 we entered into a water rights settlement agreement with the gila river indian community gric which was later included in a comprehensive water rights settlement under the arizona water settlements act of 2004 the gric settlement is subject to contingencies that must be met before the agreement is fully effective and the comprehensive settlement has been challenged by other parties if we are unable to resolve the contingencies in the gric settlement and defeat the thirdparty challenges our water rights in the gila river watershed could be diminished and our operations at morenci sierrita and safford could be adversely affected 

prior to january 1 1983 various indian tribes filed suits in the us district court in arizona claiming superior rights to water being used by many other water users including us and claiming damages for prior use in derogation of their allegedly superior rights these federal proceedings have been stayed pending the arizona 

 

superior court adjudications

 

united states v gila valley irrigation district  united states district court district of arizona was initiated in 1925 by the united states to settle conflicting claims to water rights in portions of the gila river watershed a decree settling the claims of various parties was entered in 1935 after morenci had been dismissed from the case without prejudice in 1988 the gila river indian community intervened challenging uses of water in the gila river watershed which may impact water that we have the right to divert annually from eagle creek chase creek or the san francisco river for operation of our morenci mine pursuant to decreed rights and an agreement between us and the gila valley irrigation district our morenci operations also purchased farm lands with water rights in 1997 1998 and 2008 that are subject to this proceeding impairment of our water claims in the gila river watershed could adversely affect the operations of our morenci and safford mines

henderson the henderson molybdenum mine is located approximately 42 miles west of denver colorado off us highway 40 nearby communities include the towns of empire georgetown and idaho springs the henderson mill site is located approximately 15 miles west of the mine and is accessible from colorado state highway 9 the henderson mine and mill are connected by a 10mile conveyor tunnel under the continental divide and an additional fivemile surface conveyor the tunnel portal is located five miles east of the mill the mine has been in operation since 1976 the henderson mine is a porphyry molybdenum deposit with molybdenite as the primary sulfide mineral

 

the henderson operation consists of a large blockcave underground mining complex feeding a 36000 metric tonperday concentrator henderson has the capacity to produce approximately 40 million pounds of molybdenum per year with production expected to be at or near capacity over the next three years the underground mining equipment fleet consists of 17 ninemetric ton loadhauldumps and seven 36 and 73metric ton haul trucks which feed a gyratory crusher feeding a series of three overland conveyors to the mill stockpiles mining is currently from two production levels the majority of the molybdenum concentrate produced is shipped to our fort madison iowa processing facility 

 

the henderson mine is located in a mountain region with the main access shaft at 3180 meters above sea level the main production levels are currently at elevations of 2350 and 2000 meters above sea level this region experiences significant snowfall during the winter months 

 

the henderson mine and mill operations encompass approximately 11878 acres comprising 11843 acres of patented mining claims and other fee lands and a 35acre easement with the us forest service for the surface portion of the conveyor corridor 

 

henderson operations receive electrical power through longterm contracts with xcel energy and natural gas through longterm contracts with bp energy with xcel energy as the transporter we believe henderson has sufficient water resources at the mine and mill for any planned production scenarios 

 

climax the climax molybdenum mine is located 13 miles northeast of leadville colorado off colorado state highway 91 at the top of freemont pass the mine is accessible by paved roads the climax mine is a porphyry molybdenum deposit with molybdenite as the primary sulfide mineral 

 

the climax mine was placed on careandmaintenance status in 1995 in december 2007 we announced plans to restart the climax mine this 500 million project involves construction of new milling facilities and the restart of openpit mining refer to “development and exploration” for further discussion 

 

the climax mine is located in a mountain region the highest bench elevation is approximately 4050 meters above sea level and the ultimate pit bottom is expected to be approximately 3100 meters above sea level this region experiences significant snowfall during the winter months the climax operation encompasses approximately 14339 acres of patented mining claims and other fee lands 

 

climax’s electrical power is supplied by xcel energy we expect that once the operations are restarted xcel energy will be able to supply sufficient energy to the climax mine although we believe the climax operation has sufficient water resources to support mining operations as currently planned we are a party to litigation that could adversely affect our water rights at climax refer to item 3 legal proceedings for information concerning the status of these proceedings

indonesia 

 

pt freeport indonesia is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the republic of indonesia and incorporated in delaware we directly own 8128 percent of pt freeport indonesia 936 percent indirectly through our subsidiary pt indocopper investama and the government of indonesia owns the remaining 936 percent pt freeport indonesia mines processes and explores for ore containing copper gold and silver it operates in the remote highlands of the sudirman mountain range in the province of papua indonesia which is on the western half of the island of new guinea pt freeport indonesia markets its concentrates containing copper gold and silver worldwide 

 

pt freeport indonesia operates under an agreement the contract of work with the government of indonesia the contract of work allows us to conduct exploration mining and production activities in a 24700acre area referred to as block a located in papua under the contract of work pt freeport indonesia also conducts exploration activities which had been suspended but resumed in 2007 in an approximate 500000acre area referred to as block b in papua all of pt freeport indonesia’s proven and probable mineral reserves and current mining operations are located in block a 

 

in july 2004 we received a request from the indonesian department of energy and mineral resources that we offer to sell shares in pt indocopper investama to indonesian nationals at fair market value in response to this request and in view of the potential benefits of having additional indonesian ownership in our operations we agreed at that time to consider a potential sale of an interest in pt indocopper investama at fair market value neither our contract of work nor indonesian law requires us to divest any portion of our ownership interest in pt freeport indonesia or pt indocopper investama 

 

in 1996 we established joint ventures with rio tinto plc rio tinto an international mining company with headquarters in london england one joint venture covers pt freeport indonesia’s mining operations in block a and gives rio tinto through 2021 a 40 percent interest in certain assets and future production exceeding specified annual amounts of copper gold and silver in block a and after 2021 a 40 percent interest in all production from block a operating nonexpansion capital and administrative costs are shared proportionately between pt freeport indonesia and rio tinto based on the ratio of a the incremental revenues from production from our expansion completed in 1998 to b total revenues from 

 

block a including production from pt freeport indonesia’s previously existing reserves pt freeport indonesia receives 100 percent of the cash flow from specified annual amounts of copper gold and silver through 2021 calculated by reference to its proven and probable reserves as of december 31 1994 and 60 percent of all remaining cash flow pt freeport indonesia records its joint venture interest using the proportionate consolidation method 

 

contracts of work 

 

through a contract of work with the government of indonesia pt freeport indonesia conducts its current exploration and mining operations in indonesia the contract of work governs our rights and obligations relating to taxes exchange controls royalties repatriation and other matters and was concluded pursuant to the 1967 foreign capital investment law which expresses indonesia’s foreign investment policy and provides basic guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization a framework for economic incentives and basic rules regarding other rights and obligations of foreign investors specifically the contract of work provides that the government of indonesia will not nationalize or expropriate pt freeport indonesia’s mining operations any disputes regarding the provisions of the contract of work are subject to international arbitration we have experienced no disputes requiring arbitration during the 40 years we have operated in indonesia 

 

pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work covers both block a which was first included in a 1967 contract of work that was replaced by a new contract of work in 1991 and block b to which we gained rights in 1991 the initial term of our contract of work expires in december 2021 but we can extend it for two 10year periods subject to indonesian government approval which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably we originally had the rights to explore 65 million acres in block b but pursuant to the contract of work we have only retained the rights to approximately 500000 acres following significant geological assessment 

 

pt irja eastern minerals eastern minerals of which we own 100 percent has a contract of work with the government of indonesia containing similar terms to pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work eastern minerals signed its contract of work in august 1994 the contract of work originally covered approximately 25 million exploration acres eastern minerals’ contract of work provides for a fourtoseven year exploratory term and a 30year term for mining operations subject to indonesian government approval which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably we can extend this period for two 10year periods eastern minerals’ contract of work requires us to relinquish our rights to 25 percent of the original 25millionacre contract of work area at the end of each of three specified periods as of december 31 2007 we had relinquished approximately 13 million acres and we expect to relinquish an additional 06 million acres in early 2008 the exploration activities under eastern minerals’ contract of work also have been suspended in recent years however in december 2006 eastern minerals received approval from the government of indonesia to resume exploration activities in 2007 

 

under a joint venture agreement through pt nabire bakti mining we conduct exploration activities in an area covering approximately 500000 acres in five parcels contiguous to pt freeport indonesia’s block b and one of eastern minerals’ blocks 

 

pt freeport indonesia pays a copper royalty under its contact of work that varies from 15 percent of copper net revenue at a copper price of 090 or less per pound to 35 percent at a copper price of 110 or more per pound the contract of work royalty rate for gold and silver sales is 10 percent 

 

a large part of the mineral royalties under government of indonesia regulations are designated to the provinces from which the minerals are extracted in connection with our fourth concentrator mill expansion pt freeport indonesia agreed to pay the government of indonesia additional royalties royalties not required by our contract of work to provide further support to the local governments and the people of papua pt freeport indonesia pays the additional royalties on production exceeding specified annual amounts of copper gold and silver expected to be generated when its milling facilities operate above 200000 metric tons of ore per day the additional royalty for copper equals the contract of work royalty rate and for gold and silver equals twice the contract of work royalty rates therefore our royalty rate on copper net revenues from production above the agreed levels is double the contract of work royalty rate and our royalty rates on gold and silver sales from production above the agreed levels are triple the contract of work royalty rates 

 

 

 

pt freeport indonesia’s share of the combined royalties including the additional royalties which became effective january 1 1999 totaled 133 million in 2007 126 million in 2006 and 104 million in 2005

 

grasberg minerals district 

 

 

we and our predecessors have conducted exploration and mining operations in block a since 1967 and have been the only operator of these operations we currently have two mines in operation the grasberg open pit and the deep ore zone doz underground block cave the doz and the ertsberg stockwork zone are adjacent to each other and are being mined together following our recently completed expansion of our underground operations to 50000 metric tons per day and the planned expansion to 80000 metric tons per day 

 

grasberg openpit      we began openpit mining of the grasberg ore body in 1990 openpit operations are expected to continue until mid2015 at which time the grasberg underground mining operations are scheduled to begin production is currently at the 3305 to 4285meter elevation level and totaled 575 million metric tons of ore in 2007 and 637 million metric tons of ore in 2006 which provided 75 percent of our 2007 mill feed and 80 percent of our 2006 mill feed our openpit mining rate including ore and overburden totaled 667600 metric tons per day in 2007 and 677200 metric tons per day in 2006 approximate annual production rates are expected to range between 600000 metric tons per day and 700000 metric tons per day through 2010 and then decline through 2015 

 

the current grasberg equipment fleet consists of over 500 units as of december 31 2007 the larger mining equipment directly associated with production includes 143 haul trucks with payloads ranging from approximately 215 metric tons to 330 metric tons 18 shovels with bucket sizes ranging from 30 cubic meters to 42 cubic meters 

 

grasberg crushing and conveying systems are integral to the mine and provide the capacity to transport up to 225000 metric tons per day of grasberg ore to the mill and 135000 metric tons per day of overburden to the overburden stockpiles the remaining ore and overburden is moved by haul trucks 

 

deep ore zone  the doz ore body lies vertically below the now depleted intermediate ore zone we began production from the doz ore body in 1989 using open stope mining methods but we suspended production in 1991 in favor of production from the grasberg deposit production resumed in september 2000 using the blockcave method production is at the 3110meter elevation level and totaled 195 million metric tons of ore in 2007 and 165 million metric tons of ore in 2006 production from the doz 

averaged 53500 metric tons of ore per day in 2007 and 45200 metric tons of ore per day in 2006 

 

during 2007 we completed over 16300 meters of development drifting in support of the blockcave mining method and in mid2007 we completed an expansion of the doz underground operation to allow a sustained rate of 50000 metric tons of ore per day further expansion of the doz operation to 80000 metric tons of ore per day is under way with completion targeted by 2010 our success in developing the doz mine one of the world’s largest underground mines has given us additional confidence in the future development of our largescale undeveloped ore bodies 

 

the doz mine fleet consists of over 175 pieces of mobile heavy equipment the primary mining equipment directly associated with production and development includes 51 loadhauldump lhd units and 20 haul trucks our production lhd units typically carry approximately 11 metric tons of ore using ore passes and chutes the lhd units transfer ore into 55ton capacity haul trucks the trucks dump into two gyratory crushers and ore is then conveyed to the surface stockpiles 

 

our principal source of power for all our indonesian operations is a coalfired power plant that we built in conjunction with our fourth concentrator mill expansion diesel generators supply peaking and backup electrical power generating capacity a combination of naturally occurring mountain streams and water derived from our underground operations provides water for our operations our indonesian operations are in an active seismic zone and experience average annual rainfall of 195 inches 

 

mining operations  mines in development 

 

development projects in addition to the grasberg open pit and doz four other ore bodies the underground grasberg kucing liar mill level zonedeep mill level zone and big gossan are located in block a these ore bodies are at various stages of development and are included in our proven and probable recoverable reserves we continually review our operation’s development opportunities to maximize the value of the reserves we incurred 270 million 247 million for our share for mine development and supporting infrastructure capital expenditures related primarily to the grasberg block cave and big gossan ore bodies and 40 million 30 million for our share for common underground infrastructure development during the three years ended december 31 2007 see “risk factors” 

 

the underground grasberg reserves will be mined using the blockcave method at the end of openpit mining which is expected to continue until approximately mid2015 the kucing liar ore body lies on the southern flank of and underneath the southern portion of the grasberg open pit at the 2605 to 3115meter elevation level we expect to mine the kucing liar ore body using the blockcave method 

 

beginning in 2007 we report the mill level zone and deep mill level zone ore bodies as one ore body because we plan to mine them using some of the same infrastructure the mill level zone lies directly below the doz mine at the 2890meter elevation and the deep mill level zone lies beneath the mill level zone at the 2590meter elevation this ore represents the downward continuation of mineralization in the ertsberg east skarn system and neighboring ertsberg porphyry drilling efforts continue to determine the extent of this ore body we expect to mine the mill level zone using a blockcave method near completion of mining at the doz near the end of mining the mill level zone we expect to mine the deep mill level zone also using a blockcave method 

 

the big gossan ore body is located approximately 1000 meters southwest of the original ertsberg openpit deposit we began the initial underground development of the ore body in 1993 when we drove tunnels from the mill area into the ore zone at the 3000meter elevation level a stope and fill mining method will be used on the big gossan deposit we expect to begin mining the big gossan ore body in 2008 with production expected to ramp up to 7000 metric tons per day in late 2010 average annual aggregate incremental production of 125 million pounds of copper and 65000 ounces of gold with pt freeport indonesia receiving 60 percent of these amounts 

 

in 2004 pt freeport indonesia commenced its “common infrastructure” project which will provide access to its large undeveloped underground ore bodies located in the grasberg minerals district through a tunnel system located approximately 400 meters deeper than its existing underground tunnel system in addition to providing access to our underground ore bodies the tunnel system will enable us to conduct future exploration in prospective areas associated with currently identified ore bodies the tunnel system 

 

has reached the big gossan terminal and we are proceeding with development of the lower big gossan infrastructure we have also advanced development of the grasberg spur and as of december 31 2007 has completed 96 percent of the tunneling required to reach the grasberg underground ore body we expect the grasberg spur to reach the grasberg underground ore body and to initiate multiyear mine development activities in the second half of 2008 

 

studies are under way to update the estimated aggregate capital expenditures to reach full production capacity for the undeveloped ore bodies in the grasberg district previous estimates of approximately 31 billion for the development of these ore bodies were primarily based on studies completed in 2003 these amounts included 12 billion in estimated capital for the grasberg underground 07 billion for kucing liar 02 billion for big gossan and 06 billion for mlzdeep mlz recent estimates for the development of the grasberg underground ore body which continue to be reviewed indicate aggregate capital approximating 3 billion to be incurred between 2008 and 2021 the increase of approximately 18 billion primarily reflects higher labor and contractor costs increased costs for mobile equipment and other input costs current cost estimates for big gossan approximate 05 billion our underground operations in indonesia are more sensitive to changes in labor costs than our open pit and process operations we will continue to pursue productivity initiatives to mitigate the impact of increased labor costs cost estimates for kucing liar and mlzdeep mlz which are not expected to begin development for several years have not been updated from prior studies 

 

aggregate capital costs to develop the underground ore bodies are expected to average approximately 275 million per year through 2021 

 

description of ore bodies  our ore bodies are located within and around two main igneous intrusions the grasberg monzodiorite and the ertsberg diorite the host rocks of these ore bodies include both carbonate and clastic rocks that form the ridge crests and upper flanks of the sudirman range and the igneous rocks of monzonitic to dioritic composition that intrude them the igneoushosted ore bodies the grasberg open pit and block cave and the ertsberg stockwork zone block cave occur as vein stockworks and disseminations of copper sulphides dominated by chalcopyrite and to a much lesser extent bornite the sedimentaryrock hosted ore bodies occur as “magnetiterich calciummagnesian skarn” replacements whose location and orientation are strongly influenced by major faults and by the chemistry of the carbonate rocks along the margins of the intrusions 

 

the copper mineralization in these skarn deposits is also dominated by chalcopyrite but higher bornite concentrations are common moreover gold occurs in significant concentrations in all of the district’s ore bodies though rarely visible to the naked eye these gold concentrations usually occur as inclusions within the copper sulphide minerals though in some deposits these concentrations can also be strongly associated with pyrite 

 

the following diagram indicates the relative elevations in meters of our reported ore bodies 

 

the following map which encompasses an area of approximately 42 square kilometers approximately 16 square miles indicates the relative positions and sizes of our reported ore bodies and their locations

tenke fungurume 

 

the tenke fungurume deposits are located in the katanga province of the drc approximately 110 miles northwest of lubumbashi the deposits are accessible by unpaved roads and by rail we have an effective 5775 percent interest in the concessions and are the operator of the project the remaining ownership interests are held by tenke mining corptmc which is owned by lundin mining corporation 2475 percent and la generale des carrieres et des mines which is wholly owned by the government 

 

 

of the drc 175 percent we are responsible for funding 70 percent of project development costs and at our joint venture partner’s election we are also responsible for financing our partner’s share of project overruns of more than 25 percent of the feasibility study cost estimates 

 

in february 2008 we received a letter from the ministry of mines government of the democratic republic of congo seeking our comment on proposed material modifications to our mining contract for the tenke fungurume concession including the amount of transfer payments payable to the government the government’s percentage ownership and involvement in the management of the mine regularization of certain matters under congolese law and the implementation of social plans our mining contract was negotiated transparently and approved by the government of the drc following extended negotiations and we believe it complies with congolese law and is enforceable without modifications we are currently working cooperatively with the ministry of mines to resolve these matters while continuing with our project development activities 

 

the tenke fungurume deposits are sedimenthosted coppercobalt deposits with leachable oxide mixed oxidesulfide and sulfide mineralization the dominant oxide minerals are malachite pseudomalachite and heterogenite important sulfide minerals consist of bornite carrollite chalcocite and chalcopyrite 

 

copper and cobalt will be recovered through an agitationleach plant capable of processing 8000 metric tons of ore per day operations are expected to begin in 2009 with average annual production of approximately 250 million pounds of copper approximately 144 million pounds for our share and 18 million pounds of cobalt approximately 10 million pounds for our share the current fleet includes 28 fivecubic meter frontend loaders 28 45metric ton haul trucks surface miners production drills sampling machines and crawler dozers 

 

tenke fungurume is located in a tropical region however temperatures are moderated by its higher altitudes weather in this region is characterized by a dry season and a wet season each lasting about six months and average rainfall is 47 inches per year the highest bench elevation is expected to be 1480 meters above sea level and the ultimate pit bottom is expected to be 1270 meters above sea level the tenke fungurume deposits are located within four concessions totaling 394455 acres of mining claims 

 

tenke fungurume has entered into longterm power supply and infrastructure funding agreements with la societe nationale d’electricite snel the stateowned electric utility company serving the region the results of a recent water exploration program as well as the regional geological and hydrogeological conditions indicate that adequate water will be available for the expected life of the operation 

 

atlantic copper and pt smelting 

 

atlantic copper  sa we own 100 percent of atlantic copper a copper smelter located in huelva spain atlantic copper completed the last expansion of its production capacity in 1997 and the design capacity of its smelter is 290000 metric tons of copper per year and its refinery currently has a nominal capacity of 260000 metric tons of copper per year we have no present plans to expand atlantic copper’s production capacity 

 

during 2007 atlantic copper treated 952300 metric tons of concentrate and scrap and produced 256100 metric tons of new copper anodes and 243600 metric tons of copper cathodes during 2006 atlantic copper treated 953700 metric tons of concentrate and scrap and produced 263700 metric tons of new copper anodes and 235400 metric tons of copper cathodes in june 2007 atlantic copper completed a scheduled 23day maintenance turnaround major maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately every 12 years for atlantic copper with significantly shorter term maintenance turnarounds occurring in the interim the next scheduled maintenance activity at atlantic copper is in 2011 

 

atlantic copper purchased approximately 43 percent of its 2007 concentrate requirements from pt freeport indonesia at market prices atlantic copper has experienced no significant operating problems and we are not aware of any potential material environmental liabilities at atlantic copper 

 

we made no capital contributions to atlantic copper from 2005 through 2007 however we contributed 

 

 

202 million to atlantic copper in 2004 in addition we loaned 190 million to atlantic copper in 2004 the funds were used to improve atlantic copper’s financial structure during its 2004 major maintenance turnaround and during a period of extremely low treatment and refining charge rates our net investment in atlantic copper through december 31 2007 was approximately 139 million 

 

pt smelting  pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work required us to construct or cause to be constructed a smelter in indonesia if we and the indonesian government determined that such a project would be economically viable in 1995 following the completion of a feasibility study we entered into agreements relating to the formation of pt smelting and the construction of the copper smelter in gresik indonesia 

 

pt smelting is a joint venture among pt freeport indonesia mitsubishi materials corporation mitsubishi corporation and nippon mining  metals co ltd which own 25 percent 605 percent 95 percent and 5 percent respectively of the outstanding pt smelting common stock in accordance with the joint venture agreements pt freeport indonesia provides the majority of pt smelting’s copper concentrate requirements in december 2003 pt smelting’s shareholder agreement was amended to eliminate pt freeport indonesia’s assignment of its earnings in pt smelting to support a 13 percent cumulative annual return to the other owners for the first 20 years of operations pt freeport indonesia’s total investment in pt smelting through december 31 2007 was 101 million 

 

during 2007 pt smelting treated 976300 metric tons of concentrate and produced 277100 metric tons of new copper anodes and 256900 metric tons of copper cathodes during 2006 pt smelting treated 737500 metric tons of concentrate and produced 201200 metric tons of new copper anodes and 217600 metric tons of copper cathodes higher volumes in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily reflect a 22day maintenance turnaround in the second quarter of 2006 and pt smelting’s temporary suspension of operations beginning in october 2006 and ending in middecember 2006 following an equipment failure at the oxygen plant supplying the smelter major maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately every four years for pt smelting with significantly shorter term maintenance turnarounds in the interim we have a 25day maintenance turnaround scheduled for may 2008 pt smelting’s production capacity is approximately 275000 metric tons we are not aware of any potential material environmental liabilities at pt smelting

ore reserves 

recoverable proven and probable reserves shown below have been calculated as of december 31 2007 in accordance with industry guide 7 as required by the securities and exchange act of 1934 proven and probable reserves may not be comparable to similar information regarding mineral reserves disclosed in accordance with the guidance of other countries recoverable proven and probable reserves were determined by the use of mapping drilling sampling assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry as more fully discussed below the term “reserve” as used in the reserve data presented here means that part of a mineral deposit which can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination the term “proven reserves” means reserves for which 1 quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops trenches workings or drill holes 2 grade andor quality are computed from the result of detailed sampling and 3 the sites for inspection sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established the term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced the degree of assurance although lower than that for proven reserves is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 

 

our reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies we conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk we revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves were assessed using longterm average prices of 120 per pound for copper 450 per ounce for gold 650 per pound for molybdenum 750 per ounce for silver and 1200 per pound for cobalt along with nearterm price forecasts reflective of the current price environment the london spot metal prices for the past three years averaged 265 per pound for copper and 582 per ounce for gold and the metals week molybdenum dealer oxide price averaged 2890 per pound for molybdenum 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

the reserve table above and the tables on pages 27 to 31 and 34 utilize the following abbreviations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

in defining our openpit reserves we apply an “economic cutoff grade” strategy the objective of this strategy is to maximize the net present value of our operations we use a breakeven cutoff grade to define the insitu reserves for our underground ore bodies the breakeven cutoff grade is defined for a metric ton of ore as that equivalent copper grade once produced and sold that generates sufficient revenue to cover all operating and administrative costs associated with our production 

 

our copper mines may contain other commercially recoverable metals such as gold molybdenum silver and cobalt we value all commercially recoverable metals in terms of a copper equivalent percentage to determine a single breakeven cutoff grade copper equivalent percentage is used to express the relative value of multimetal ores in terms of one metal the calculation expresses the relative value of the ore using estimates of contained metal quantities metals prices as used for reserve determination recovery rates treatment charges and royalties our molybdenum properties use a molybdenum cutoff grade the table below shows the breakeven cutoff grade by process for each of our existing ore bodies as of december 31 2007 

 

 

 

 

drill hole spacing data is used by mining professionals such as mining engineers in determining the suitability of data coverage on a relative basis in a given deposit type and mining method scenario so as to achieve a given level of confidence in the resource estimate drill hole spacing is only one of several criteria necessary to establish resource classification drilling programs are typically designed to achieve an optimum sample spacing to support the level of confidence in results that apply to a particular stage of development of a mineral deposit the following table sets forth the average drill hole spacing for proven and probable ore reserves by process type 

 

 

 

 

the following chart illustrates our current plans for sequencing and producing the december 31 2007 proven and probable reserves at each of our ore bodies and the years in which we currently expect production of each ore body to begin and end the chart also shows the term of pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work production volumes are typically lower in the first few years of each ore body as development activities are ongoing and as the mine ramps up to full production the ultimate timing of the start of production from our undeveloped mines is dependent upon a number of factors including the results of our exploration and development efforts and may vary from the dates shown below in addition we develop our mine plans based on maximizing the net present value from the ore bodies 

 

mill and leach stockpiles 

both mill and leach stockpiles generally contain lowergrade ores that have been extracted from the ore body and are available for copper recovery for mill stockpiles recovery is through milling concentrating smelting and refining or alternatively by concentrate leaching for leach stockpiles recovery is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities 

 

because it is generally impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count reasonable estimation methods are employed the quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grades of material delivered 

 

 

to mill and leach stockpiles 

 

expected copper recovery rates for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing the recoverable copper in mill stockpiles once entered into the production process can be extracted into copper concentrate almost immediately 

 

expected copper recovery rates for leach stockpiles are determined using smallscale laboratory tests small to largescale column testing which simulates the productionscale process historical trends and other factors including mineralogy of the ore and rock type ultimate recovery of copper contained in leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low percentage to more than 90 percent depending on several variables including type of copper recovery mineralogy and particle size of the rock for newly placed material on active stockpiles as much as 70 percent of the copper ultimately recoverable may be extracted during the first year and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years 

 

processes and recovery rates are monitored continuously and recovery rate estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes 

 

following are our stockpiles and the estimated recoverable copper contained within those stockpiles as of december 31 2007 

 

 

mineralized material 

we hold various properties containing mineralized materials that we believe could be brought into production should market conditions warrant mineralized material is a mineralized body that has been delineated by appropriately spaced drilling andor underground sampling to support the reported tonnage and average metal grades such a deposit may not qualify as recoverable proven and probable reserves until legal and economic feasibility are confirmed based upon a comprehensive evaluation of development costs unit costs grades recoveries and other material factors estimated mineralized materials were assessed using prices of 150 per pound of copper 450 per ounce of gold and 1000 per pound of molybdenum permitting and significant capital expenditures would likely be required before operations could commence at these properties our estimated mineralized material as of december 31 2007 follows 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

development and exploration 

development activities we have significant development activities recently completed or under way to expand our production capacity extend our mine lives and develop largescale underground ore bodies recently completed or current major projects include 

 

·   the expansion of the cerro verde mill which reached capacity in the second half of 2007 

·   a major new mining complex at safford arizona currently ramping up to full production 

·   the restart of a mill and the completion of a concentrateleach directelectrowinning facility at morenci 

·   a sulfide leach project to extend the mine life at el abra 

·   the development of largescale highgrade underground ore bodies in the grasberg district 

·   development of the tenke fungurume project in the drc 

·   the planned restart of our climax molybdenum mine 

·   the planned restart of our miami mine and 

·   incremental expansion projects at morenci bagdad sierrita and cerro verde 

 

the recently expanded mill at cerro verde reached design capacity of 108000 metric tons of ore per day in mid2007 the expansion enables cerro verde to produce approximately 650 to 700 million pounds of copper per year 

 

the safford mining complex in arizona is substantially complete and commenced production in late 2007 safford will produce from two open pits and includes a sxew facility total capital expenditures for this project approximated 675 million 

 

the concentrateleach direct electrowinning facility at morenci was commissioned in thirdquarter 2007 and is currently ramping up production the project utilizes our proprietary mediumtemperature pressureleaching and directelectrowinning technology which will enhance cost savings by processing concentrate onsite instead of shipping concentrate to smelters for treatment in addition the project included the restart of a mill in the first half of 2007 mill throughput adds 115 million pounds of copper production per year and is running near capacity of 49000 metric tons of ore per day total capital expenditures for this project approximated 250 million 

 

at the end of 2006 a feasibility study was completed to evaluate the development of a large sulfide deposit at el abra the project would extend the mine life by over ten years and is expected to provide an additional 325 million pounds of copper per year copper production from sulfides is expected to begin in 2010 the project will utilize a portion of the existing facilities to process the additional reserves capital investment is expected to approximate 450 million the majority of which will be spent between 2008 and 2011 we are currently working with chilean authorities on an environmental impact study related to this project and expect to receive approval in the first half of 2008 

 

there are several projects in progress throughout the grasberg minerals district including developing the largescale underground ore bodies located beneath and adjacent to the grasberg open pit the doz expansion was completed in 2007 with fourthquarter production averaging 59000 metric tons of ore per day a further expansion of the doz mine is currently under way with completion targeted for 2010 other projects include the development of the highgrade big gossan mine expected to rampup to full production of 7000 metric tons per day in late 2010 and the continued development of the common infrastructure project which will provide access to the grasberg underground ore body the kucing liar ore body and future development of the mineralized areas below the doz mine 

 

the initial project at tenke fungurume is based on ore reserves approximating 100 million metric tons with ore grades of 23 percent copper and 03 percent cobalt construction of this project is in progress operations are targeted to commence during 2009 with average annual production of approximately 250 million pounds of copper and approximately 18 million pounds of cobalt 

 

 

we are responsible for funding 70 percent of project development costs the total capital investment for this project is currently estimated at approximately 900 million with approximately 35 percent incurred through december 31 2007 capital cost estimates will continue to be reviewed as engineering and construction activities progress 

 

in december 2007 we announced the plans to proceed with the restart of the climax mine which is expected to produce approximately 30 million pounds of molybdenum per year beginning in 2010 the project is designed to enable the consideration of further largescale expansion of the mine capital investment for this restart is expected to approximate 500 million 

 

in january 2008 we announced the restart of the miami mine in arizona for an approximate fiveyear period we expect production of 100 million pounds of copper per year by 2010 capital investment for this restart is expected to approximate 100 million primarily for mining equipment 

 

in addition to the projects currently under way we are continuing to evaluate expansion opportunities associated with existing ore bodies as an initial step we are pursuing incremental expansions at morenci sierrita bagdad and cerro verde the morenci project is expected to increase annual copper production by 100 million pounds starting in 2009 the bagdad mill expansion is expected to increase annual copper production by 55 million pounds starting in 2009 the sierrita mill expansion is expected to increase annual copper production by 25 million pounds starting in 2010 and the cerro verde mill expansion is expected to increase annual copper production by 30 million pounds these projects will require an aggregate capital investment of approximately 400 million detailed engineering for these projects is under way 

 

capital costs have been affected by the prices of input costs including equipment materials and supplies and labor we will continue to review and update our capital cost estimates as engineering and construction activities progress on our major projects

 

exploration activities we are conducting exploration activities near our existing mines and in other areas around the world aggregate exploration expenditures in 2008 are expected to approximate 175 million compared with 119 million in 2007 exploration is focused on finding largescale copper and coppergold deposits in the four principal copperproducing regions of the world southwest usmexico south american cordillera central africa and australasia as well as in other prospective areas this group operates in more than 15 countries and maintains offices in australia brazil bulgaria canada chile china central africa macedonia mexico peru russia serbia the philippines the united states and zambia 

 

our exploration efforts in north america include drilling of the lone star deposit located approximately four miles from the safford ore bodies as well as targets in the morenci and bagdad districts we are also conducting exploration activities near the henderson molybdenum deposit in south america exploration is ongoing in and around the cerro verde candelaria and ojos del salado deposits in africa we are actively pursuing targets outside of the area of initial development at tenke fungurume the number of drill rigs operating on these and other programs near our mine sites increased from 26 at the end of march 2007 to 55 at the end of 2007 

 

pt freeport indonesia’s 2008 exploration efforts in indonesia include testing extensions of the deep grasberg and kucing liar mine complex and evaluating targets in the area between the ertsberg east and grasberg mineral systems from the new common infrastructure tunnels initial drill results from the common infrastructure tunnel are positive and additional drilling is in process we are continuing our efforts to resume exploration activities in certain prospective areas in papua outside block a the grasberg contract area 

 

 

research and development following our acquisition of phelps dodge we conduct research and development programs relating to technology for exploration for minerals mining and recovery of metals from ores concentrates and solutions smelting and refining of copper metal processing reclamation and remediation and product and engineered materials development expenditures for research and 

 

development programs together with contributions to industry and governmentsupported research programs totaled 33 million in 2007

sales and competition 

north american mining 

 

copper a majority of the copper produced or purchased at our north american mining operations is cast into rod rod sales including phelps dodge sales volumes prior to our acquisition to outside wire and cable manufacturers constituted approximately 83 percent of north american copper sales in 2007 85 percent in 2006 and 88 percent in 2005 the remainder of our north american copper sales is primarily in the form of copper cathode or copper concentrate sales of rod and cathode principally are made directly to wire and cable fabricators and brass mills under us dollardenominated contracts usually of oneyear duration cathode and rod contract prices are generally based on the prevailing comex copper monthly average spot price for shipments in that period we generally sell our copper rod and cathode produced at our north american mining operations at a premium over comex prices 

 

molybdenum  most of our molybdenum is sold as five main product types molybdic oxide ferromolybdenum molybdenum chemicals molybdenum disulfide and pure molybdenum metal powder molybdic oxide and ferromolybdenum are used primarily in the steel industry for corrosion and heat resistance and strengthening approximately 80 percent of molybdenum production is used in this application molybdenum chemicals are used in a number of diverse applications such as catalyst for petroleum refining feedstock for the production of pure molybdenum metals lubricants and additives for water treatment molybdenum disulfide is used principally in lubricant and grease applications pure molybdenum metal powder products are used in a number of diverse applications such as lighting electronics and specialty steel alloys 

 

approximately 85 percent of our expected 2008 molybdenum production is committed for sale throughout the world pursuant to annual or quarterly agreements based primarily on prevailing market prices one month prior to the time of sale 

 

the market for molybdenum is characterized by cyclical and volatile prices little product differentiation and strong competition the chemical market is more diverse and contains more specialty products and segments in both markets prices are influenced by production costs of domestic and foreign competitors worldwide economic conditions world and regional supplydemand balances inventory levels governmental regulatory actions currency exchange rates and other factors molybdenum prices also are affected by the demand for enduse products in for example the construction transportation and durable goods markets a substantial portion of world molybdenum is produced as a byproduct of copper mining which is relatively insensitive to molybdenum price levels byproduct production was estimated at approximately 60 percent of global molybdenum production in 2007 

 

south american minin g    production from our south american mines is sold as copper concentrate or copper cathode under us dollardenominated longterm contracts   a majority of our cerro verde cathode production is shipped to our us rod mills for processing the remainder of cerro verde’s cathode production is sold under annual contracts to south american customers or to merchants on a spot basis cerro verde has committed to sell approximately 20 percent of its annual concentrate production at market prices to atlantic copper the balance of its copper concentrate production is sold to copper smelters primarily located in japan and elsewhere in asia under longterm contracts the candelaria mine sells its production in the form of copper concentrate primarily to copper smelters located in japan and elsewhere in asia while production not committed under longterm contracts is sold to other smelters or merchants a majority of our ojos del salado concentrate production is sold to local chilean smelters el abra produces copper cathodes that are sold primarily under annual or multiyear contracts to asian or european rod or brass mill customers or to merchants 

 

copper cathode sold by our south american operations is generally sold at a premium over lme prices with the price based on the prevailing lme copper monthly average spot price in the month of or the 

 

month following arrival substantially all of our concentrate sales are priced on the basis of the third calendar month following the month of arrival at the buyers facilities

 

indonesia  pt freeport indonesia sells its copper concentrates which contain significant quantities of gold and silver under us dollardenominated sales agreements mostly to companies in asia and europe and to international trading companies we sell substantially all of our budgeted production of copper concentrates under longterm contracts with copper selling prices based on lme prices under these contracts initial billing occurs at the time of shipment and final settlement on the copper portion is generally based on average prices for a specified future period pt freeport indonesia’s customers receive similar pricing options to those discussed above for south american mining gold generally is sold at the average london bullion market association price for a specified month near the month of shipment 

 

revenues from south american and indonesian concentrate sales are recorded net of royalties see “contracts of work” for indonesian sales treatment and refining charges including price participation charges if applicable based on the market prices of metals and the impact of derivative financial instruments if any used to hedge against risks from metals price fluctuations we do not plan on entering into hedging programs in the future moreover because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrates is unrecoverable as a result of the smelting process our revenues from concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances based on the quantity and value of these unrecoverable metals these allowances are a negotiated term of our contracts and vary by customer treatment and refining charges represent payments to smelters and refiners and are either fixed or in certain cases vary with the price of copper we sell a small amount of copper concentrates in the spot market 

 

we have commitments including commitments from atlantic copper and pt smelting for essentially all of pt freeport indonesia’s estimated 2008 production pt freeport indonesia has a longterm contract which is pending approval of the department of energy and mineral resources of the government of indonesia to provide atlantic copper with a quantity of copper concentrates at market prices that currently approximates 40 percent of atlantic copper’s annual copper concentrate requirements pt freeport indonesia’s agreement with pt smelting provides for the life of pt freeport indonesia’s mines for the supply of 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements necessary to produce 205000 metric tons of copper essentially the gresik smelter’s original design capacity on a priority basis in 2004 pt smelting increased its stated production capacity to 250000 metric tons of copper per year during 2006 pt smelting completed further expansion of its production capacity from 250000 metric tons of copper per year to 275000 metric tons for the first 15 years of pt smelting’s commercial operations beginning december 1998 pt freeport indonesia agreed that the treatment and refining charges on specified quantities of the concentrate pt freeport indonesia supplies will not fall below specified minimum rates subject to renegotiation in 2008 the rate was 023 per pound during the period from the commencement of pt smelting’s operations in 1998 until april 3 2004 when it declined to a minimum of 021 per pound pt smelting’s rates for 2008 are expected to exceed the minimum 021 per pound we anticipate that pt freeport indonesia will sell approximately 50 to 60 percent of its annual concentrate production to atlantic copper and pt smelting a summary of pt freeport indonesia’s aggregate percentage concentrate sales to its affiliates and to other parties for the last three years follows 

 

copper gold and molybdenum markets 

copper copper is an internationally traded commodity and the relevant prices are determined by the major metals exchanges – comex the lme and the shanghai futures exchange shfe prices on these exchanges generally reflect the worldwide balance of copper supply and demand 

 

copper is a critical component of the world’s infrastructure and the demand for copper ultimately reflects the rate of underlying world economic growth particularly in industrial production and construction according to brook hunt a widelyused independent metals market consultant copper’s enduse markets and their estimated shares of total consumption are 

·   construction 37 percent 

·   electrical applications 26 percent 

·   industrial machinery 15 percent 

·   transportation 11 percent and 

·   consumer products 11 percent 

 

since 1990 refined copper consumption has grown by an estimated compound annual growth rate of 31 percent to 181 million tons in 2007 according to cru an international metal markets consultancy this rate of increase was slightly higher than the growth rate of 29 percent for world industrial production over the same period asian copper consumption led by china has been particularly strong increasing by approximately six percent annually from 1990 asia now represents approximately half of the world’s refined copper consumption compared with approximately 24 percent for western europe and approximately 18 percent for the americas from 1990 through 2007 refined copper production has grown at an average annual rate of approximately three percent according to brook hunt 

 

copper consumption is closely associated with industrial production and therefore tends to follow global economic cycles copper prices are volatile and cyclical since 1990 the lme spot price of copper has averaged 124 per pound and ranged from a high annual average price of 323 per pound in 2007 to a low annual average price of 071 per pound in 1999 and 2002 over the same period the comex price of copper averaged 125 per pound and has ranged from a high annual average price of 322 per pound in 2007 to a low annual average price of 072 per pound in 1999 and 2002 

 

in 2007 the average lme price of 323 per pound was 018 above the average for 2006 continued low global inventory levels stronger global consumption in most regions and unanticipated production shortfalls resulted in continued high copper prices throughout the year during 2007 cru estimates global refined copper production and copper consumption grew by approximately 45 percent and 41 percent respectively consumption continued to be strong in asia up 61 percent driven largely by china whose copper consumption grew approximately 16 percent in 2007 european copper consumption however contracted by approximately two percent likewise us demand for copper was down approximately two percent as a result of slowing in the residential housing market visible exchange inventories decreased by approximately 14000 metric tons over the prior year to approximately 236000   metric tons 

 

in 2006 the average lme price of 305 per pound was 138 above the average for 2005 

 

gold the market for gold was strong in 2007 as a weak us dollar growing investment demand inflationary pressures and ongoing geopolitical tensions all contributed to strong market demand prices were higher in 2007 than 2006 ranging from a low of approximately 608 per ounce to a high of approximately 842 with the average price during the year of 696 per ounce prices in 2006 ranged from 521 to 725 averaging 604 per ounce compared with an average of 445 per ounce in 2005 

 

 

molybdenum  in 2007 worldwide molybdenum mine production increased by more than 10 percent from 2006 levels primary production in china grew by more than 20 percent in response to increased demand in china and restart of production idled by the government in 2005 primary production in north america declined because of unplanned production outages byproduct production in south america and north america grew at approximately 3 to 4 percent which was lower than expected because of labor unrest particularly in south america and lower ore grades following an extended period of higher ore grades

 

molybdenum supply from china to western molybdenum markets was sharply constrained later in the year because of new export quotas implemented by the chinese government in june 2007 western roaster capacity was adequate in 2007 for processing of concentrate supplies overall the industry production to consumption demand balance was in deficit for most of the year 

 

prices were higher in 2007 than 2006 and approached 2005’s record high levels prices were driven by 1 strong stainless and alloy steel demand in the first half of the year 2 strong chemical demand later in 2007 and 3 constrained supply in the us europe and japan annual metals week dealer oxide mean prices averaged 3023 per pound in 2007 compared with 2475 per pound in 2006 and 3173 per pound in 2005 inventory levels throughout the industry remain low the majority of our molybdenum sales are based on published pricing  ie  platts metals week  ryan’s notes or metal bulletin  plus a negotiated premium the remaining sales are priced on a fixed basis or on a variable basis within certain ranges for periods of varying duration 

costs 

energy including electricity diesel fuel and natural gas represents a significant portion of production costs at our operations because energy is a significant portion of our production costs we could be negatively affected by future energy availability issues or increases in energy costs 

 

during 2007 we realized cost increases that were the result of the overall improved business climate some of these cost increases were anticipated for example we realized additional compensation costs resulting from employee bonus and variablecompensation programs that are contingent on copper price andor our performance additionally our decision to bring back into production some of our highercost properties in response to strong demand for copper has increased our average cost of copper production other costs that have increased include labor taxes freight and transportation sulfuric acid and materials and supplies that are manufactured from metal or fossil fuels we anticipate that at least a portion of these cost increases may reverse in periods of lower metal and commodity prices 

 

in addition we own a onethird interest in the luna power plant located near deming new mexico public service company of new mexico pnm a subsidiary of pnm resources and tucson electric power a subsidiary of unisource energy corporation also own onethird interests and each coowner is responsible for a third of the costs and expenses pnm is the operating partner of the plant approximately 190 megawatts or onethird of the plant’s electricity is available to satisfy the electricity demands of our new mexico and arizona operations electricity in excess of our demand is sold on the wholesale market our interest in this efficient lowcost plant which utilizes natural gas is expected to continue to stabilize our southwest us operations’ energy costs and increase the reliability of our energy supply

mine operations 

 

south america at the operations in south america mine properties and facilities are controlled through mining claims or concessions under the general mining laws of the relevant country the claims or concessions are owned or controlled by the operating companies in which we or our subsidiaries have an ownership interest roads power lines and aqueducts are controlled by easements 

 

indonesia  all of our mining operations in indonesia are controlled through the contract of work which covers both block a which was first included in a 1967 contract of work that was replaced by a new contract of work in 1991 and block b to which we gained rights in 1991 the initial term of our contract of work expires in december 2021 but we can extend it for two 10year periods subject to indonesian government approval which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably 

 

africa  at the tenke fungurume operations in the drc mine properties and facilities are controlled through mining concessions under general mining laws the concessions are owned or controlled by the operating companies in which we or our subsidiaries have an ownership interest see additional discussion at tenke fungurume site description on page 20

fm services company fm services a whollyowned subsidiary of fcx furnishes certain executive administrative financial accounting legal tax and similar services to us as of december 31 2007 fm services had 141 employees fm services employees also provide services to two other publicly traded companies 

social development employment and human rights 

we have a social employment and human rights policy designed to insure we operate in compliance with the laws in the areas of our operations and in a manner that respects basic human rights and the culture of the people who are indigenous to the area we continue to make significant expenditures on social and cultural activities primarily in papua indonesia and we expect to make significant expenditures over time for similar activities in the drc these activities include 

 

·   comprehensive job training programs 

·   basic education programs 

·   public health programs including extensive malaria control 

·   agricultural assistance programs 

·   a business incubator program to encourage the local people to establish their own smallscale businesses 

·   cultural preservation programs and 

·   charitable donations 

 

in december 2000 we endorsed the joint us state departmentbritish foreign office voluntary principles on human rights and security several major natural resources companies and international human rights organizations participated in developing the voluntary principles and have endorsed them we participated in developing these principles and incorporated them into our social and human rights policy 

 

south america cerro verde has provided a variety of community support projects over the years during 2006 as a result of discussions with local mayors in the arequipa region cerro verde agreed to design domestic water and sewage treatment plants for the benefit of the region these facilities are being designed in a modular fashion so that initial installations can be readily expanded in the future the cost associated with the construction of these facilities is currently under review however we have agreed with the local authorities that the costs associated with the first phase of construction of the facilities currently estimated at 80 million 40 million for cerro verdes share will be split evenly between cerro verde and the local municipalities 

 

during 2006 the peruvian government announced that all mining companies operating in peru will make annual contributions to local development funds for a fiveyear period the contribution is equal to 375 percent of aftertax profits of which 275 percent is contributed to a local mining fund and 100 percent to a regional mining fund at december 31 2007 cerro verde’s liability associated with the local mining fund contributions totaled 49 million 

 

indonesia in 1996 pt freeport indonesia agreed to commit at least one percent of its revenues to the freeport partnership fund for community development formerly the freeport fund for irian jaya development to support villagebased health education economic and social development programs in its area of operations this commitment replaced our community development programs in which we spent a similar amount of money each year our share of contributions to the freeport partnership fund for community development totaled 48 million in 2007 44 million in 2006 and 36 million in 2005 our joint venture partner rio tinto also contributes to this fund and including their share the contributions totaled 53 million in 2007 48 million in 2006 and 42 million in 2005 

 

lembaga pembangunan masyarakat amungme kamoro lpmak oversees disbursement of the amounts we contribute to the fund lpmak’s board of commissioners is made up of a leader of the amungme people a leader of the kamoro people leaders of the three local churches a representative of the local government and a representative of pt freeport indonesia the amungme and kamoro people are original inhabitants of the land in our area of operations 

 

we believe that our social and economic development programs are responsive to the issues raised by 

 

the local villages and people and should help us to maintain good relations with the surrounding communities and avoid disruptions of mining operations nevertheless social and political instability in the area may adversely impact our mining operations see “risk factors” 

 

africa we have committed to assist the communities surrounding our tenke fungurume concession in the katanga province of the drc initiatives that have commenced over the past two years include the building of two schools and the remodeling of a third development of ten community water wells construction of roads and agricultural support programs to local farmers additionally we have committed to contribute a portion of net sales revenue from production to a trust fund for local development 

 

security matters in indonesia    consistent with our contract of work in indonesia and the requirement to protect our employees and property we have taken appropriate steps to provide a safe and secure working environment as part of its security program pt freeport indonesia maintains its own internal security department which performs functions such as protecting company facilities monitoring the shipment of company goods through the airport and terminal assisting in traffic control and aiding rescue operations pt freeport indonesia’s civilian security employees numbering approximately 680 are unarmed and perform duties consistent with their internal security role pt freeport indonesia’s share of costs for its internal civilian security department totaled approximately 17 million for 2007 14 million for 2006 and 11 million for 2005 the security department has received human rights training and each member is required to certify his or her compliance with our human rights policy 

 

pt freeport indonesia and all businesses and residents of indonesia rely on the government of indonesia for the maintenance of public order upholding the rule of law and the protection of personnel and property the grasberg mine has been designated by the government of indonesia as one of indonesia’s vital national assets this designation results in the military and police playing a significant role in protecting the area of our operations the government of indonesia is responsible for employing police and military personnel and directing their operations 

 

from the outset of pt freeport indonesia’s operations the government has looked to pt freeport indonesia to provide logistical and infrastructure support and assistance for these necessary services because of the limited resources of the indonesian government and the remote location of and lack of development in papua pt freeport indonesia’s financial support for the indonesian government security institutions assigned to the operations area represents a prudent response to its requirements to protect its workforce and property better ensuring that personnel are properly fed and lodged and have the logistical resources to patrol pt freeport indonesia’s roads and secure its operating area in addition provision of such support and oversight is consistent with pt freeport indonesia’s obligations under the contract of work reflects our philosophy of responsible corporate citizenship and is in keeping with our commitment to pursue practices that will promote human rights 

 

pt freeport indonesia’s share of support costs for the governmentprovided security involving approximately 2100 indonesian government security personnel currently located in the general area of our operations was 9 million for 2007 9 million for 2006 and 6 million for 2005 this supplemental support consists of various infrastructure and other costs such as food housing fuel travel vehicle repairs allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs and community assistance programs conducted by the military and police pt freeport indonesia’s capital costs for associated infrastructure was less than 1 million for the three years ended december 31 2007 

 

as reported in january 2006 we have received and responded to requests from governmental authorities related to pt freeport indonesia’s support of indonesian security institutions we are cooperating fully with these requests 

environmental and reclamation matters 

environmental 

in the us we are subject to stringent federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern emissions of air pollutants discharges of water pollutants and generation handling storage and 

 

disposal of hazardous substances hazardous wastes and other toxic materials we also are subject to potential liabilities arising under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and similar state laws that impose responsibility on persons who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances and on current and previous owners and operators of a facility for the cleanup of hazardous substances released from the facility into the environment including damages to natural resources 

 

phelps dodge and many of its affiliates and predecessor companies have been involved in mining milling and manufacturing in the us for more than a century activities that occurred in the late 19 th century and the 20 th century prior to the advent of modern environmental laws were not subject to environmental regulation and were conducted before american industrial companies understood the longterm effects of their operations on the surrounding environment with the passage of cercla in 1980 companies like phelps dodge became legally responsible for environmental remediation on properties previously owned or operated by them irrespective of when the damage to the environment occurred or who caused it that liability often is shared on a joint and several basis with all other owners and operators meaning that each owner or operator of the property is fully responsible for the cleanup although in many cases some or all of the historical owners or operators no longer exist do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found as a result because of our acquisition of phelps dodge in 2007 many of the subsidiary companies we now own are responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the us and we expect to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those remediation issues various of our subsidiaries previously have been advised by the us environmental protection agency epa the department of the interior the department of agriculture and several state agencies that under cercla or similar state laws and regulations they may be liable for costs of responding to environmental conditions at sites that have been or are being investigated by epa the department of the interior the department of agriculture or state agencies to determine whether releases of hazardous substances have occurred and if so to develop and implement remedial actions to address environmental concerns as of december 31 2007 we had more than 100 active remediation projects in the us in more than 25 states we are also subject to claims for natural resource damages where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have injured natural resources a number of our subsidiaries have also been advised by trustees for natural resources that they may be liable under cercla or similar state laws for damages to natural resources caused by releases of hazardous substances 

 

under applicable purchase accounting rules we are required to allocate the purchase price paid for phelps dodge in accordance with our estimate of the fair value of all the phelps dodge assets and liabilities including contingencies such as environmental remediation obligations that process must be completed by the first anniversary of the acquisition or march 19 2008 our revised estimates resulted in a significant increase in our reserve for environmental obligations at december 31 2007 at december 31 2007 environmental reserves recorded in our consolidated balance sheets totaled 13 billion which include the purchase accounting adjustments to reflect the estimated fair value of the phelps dodge obligations attributed to cercla or analogous state programs and for estimated future costs associated with environmental matters at closed facilities and closed portions of certain operating facilities 

 

in 2005 pt freeport indonesia agreed to participate in the government of indonesia’s proper program for pollution control evaluation and rating program in march 2006 the indonesian ministry of environment announced the preliminary results of its proper environmental management audit acknowledging the effectiveness of pt freeport indonesia’s environmental management practices in some areas while making several suggestions for improvement in others we are working with the ministry of environment to address the issues raised as we complete the audit process  

in connection with obtaining our environmental approvals from the indonesian government we committed to perform a onetime environmental risk assessment on the impacts of our tailings management plan we completed this extensive environmental risk assessment with more than 90 scientific studies 

 

 

conducted over four years and submitted it to the indonesian government in december 2002 we developed the risk assessment study with input from an independent review panel which included representatives from the indonesian government academia and nongovernmental organizations the risks that we identified during this process were in line with our impact projections of the tailings management program contained in our environmental approval documents 

 

the cost of complying with environmental laws is a fundamental cost of our business in 2007 we incurred aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs of 320 million including 228 million incurred since march 20 2007 related to the acquired phelps dodge operations for programs to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect our operations aggregate environmental capital expenditures totaled 63 million in 2006 and 44 million in 2005 in 2008 we expect to incur approximately 520 million of aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs which are part of our overall 2008 operating budget 

 

refer to note 15 for additional information on significant environmental matters 

asset retirement obligations 

we recognize asset retirement obligations aros as liabilities when incurred with the initial measurement at fair value these liabilities are accreted to full value over time through charges to income reclamation costs for future disturbances are recorded as an aro in the period of disturbance our cost estimates are reflected on a thirdparty cost basis and comply with our legal obligation to retire tangible longlived assets as defined by sfas no 143 refer to note 1 for further discussion of our accounting policy for reclamation and closure costs 

 

at december 31 2007 we had 728 million recorded for aros in current and longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet aro costs may increase or decrease significantly in the future as a result of changes in regulations engineering designs and technology permit modifications or updates mine plans cost of inflation or other factors and as actual reclamation spending occurs aro activities and expenditures generally are made over an extended period of time commencing near the end of the mine life however certain reclamation activities could be accelerated if we elect or are required to do so 

 

legal requirements in new mexico arizona and colorado require financial assurance to be provided for estimated costs of reclamation and closure including groundwater quality protection programs we have satisfied financial assurance requirements by using a variety of mechanisms such as thirdparty performance guarantees financial capability demonstrations trust funds surety bonds letters of credit and collateral the applicable regulatory requirements provide financial strength tests to support thirdparty performance guarantees and financial capability demonstrations which are designed to confirm a company’s or thirdparty guarantor’s financial capability to fund future estimated reclamation and closure costs the amount of financial assurance we are required to provide will vary with changes in laws regulations and reclamation and closure cost estimates at december 31 2007 we had trust assets totaling 544 million that are designated for funding global reclamation and remediation activities of which 106 million is legally restricted to fund a portion of our asset retirement obligations for chino tyrone and cobre as required by new mexico regulatory authorities 

 

additionally in 1996 pt freeport indonesia began contributing to a cash fund 10 million balance at december 31 2007 designed to accumulate at least 100 million by the end of our indonesian mining activities we plan to use this fund including accrued interest to pay mine closure and reclamation costs any costs in excess of the 100 million fund would be funded by operational cash flow or other sources 

 

prior to its acquisition by fcx phelps dodge had initiated a process of identifying and prioritizing opportunities to accelerate certain demolition environmental reserve and asset retirement obligation projects the projects were prioritized based on regulatory flexibility to remediate at a faster pace structures that could be readily demolished reclamation of visibly impacted areas and projects in arizona and new mexico where we have substantial longterm closure obligations these costs are included in our aggregate environmental capital and other costs reported above 

 

refer to note 15 for additional information on asset retirement obligations 

water rights 

our mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining ore processing and related support facilities our operations in north and south america are in desert areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant continuous production at our mines is dependent on our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and defeat claims adverse to our current water uses in legal proceedings 

 

at our us operations under state law our water rights give us only the right to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location in arizona we are a participant in two active general stream adjudications in which for 30 years the state of arizona has been attempting to quantify and prioritize surface water claims in two of the state’s largest river systems that include four of our mines morenci sierrita safford and miami and which may also affect our arizona mine at bagdad groundwater is not subject to adjudication in arizona but is subject to the doctrine of reasonable use which requires balancing the utility of the use against the gravity of the harm to others who have rights in the same aquifer however wells may be subject to adjudication to the extent they are found to produce or affect surface water in colorado our surface water and groundwater rights are subject to adjudication and we are involved in legal proceedings to resolve disputes regarding priority of administration of rights including priority of some of our rights for the climax mine our surface water and groundwater rights are fully licensed or have been fully adjudicated in new mexico 

 

in south america water for our mining operations at candelaria and ojos del salado is drawn from the copiapo river aquifer because of rapid depletion of this aquifer in recent years ongoing studies are addressing the adequacy of this water supply for our mining operations planned at these sites 

 

although we believe our mining operations have sufficient water the loss of water rights for any of our mines in whole or in part or shortages of water to which we have rights could require us to curtail or shut down mining operations additionally we have not yet secured adequate water rights to support all of our potential expansion projects and our inability to secure those rights could prevent us from pursuing some of those opportunities see “risk factors”

financial risks 

declines in the market prices of copper gold and molybdenum could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows and therefore our ability to repay debt such declines could also cause significant volatility in our financial performance and adversely affect the trading prices of our debt and equity securities 

 

our earnings and cash flows will be affected significantly by the market prices of copper and to a lesser extent gold and molybdenum the world market prices of these commodities have fluctuated historically and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control many financial analysts who follow the metals markets are predicting that copper prices will decline significantly from their current historically high levels over the next few years a decline in the world market price of one or more of these commodities could 1 adversely affect our earnings and cash flows 2 adversely affect our ability to repay our debt and meet our other fixed obligations and 3 depress the trading prices of our common and preferred stock and of our publicly traded debt securities in addition substantially all of our copper concentrate sales contracts and some of our copper cathode sales contracts provide final pricing in a specified future period based on lme or comex prices accordingly in times of falling copper prices our revenues during a quarter are negatively impacted from lower prices received for contracts priced at current market rates and also from a decrease related to the final pricing of provisionally priced contracts entered in prior periods 

world copper prices have historically fluctuated widely during the three years ended december 31 2007 lme daily closing spot prices ranged from 139 to 400 per pound for copper world copper prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control including 

·   the strength of the us economy and the economies of other industrialized and developing nations including china which has become the largest 

  consumer of refined copper in the world 

·   available supplies of copper from mine production and inventories 

·   sales by holders and producers of copper 

·   demand for industrial products containing copper 

·   investment activity including speculation in copper as a commodity 

·   the availability and cost of substitute materials and 

·   currency exchange fluctuations including the relative strength or weakness of the usdollar 

 

world gold prices have historically fluctuated widely during the three years ended december 31 2007 the daily closing prices on the london spot market ranged from 411 to 842 per ounce for gold world gold prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control including 

 

·   the strength of the us economy and the economies of other industrialized and developing nations including china 

·   global or regional political or economic crises 

·   the relative strength of the us dollar and other currencies 

·   expectations with respect to the rate of inflation 

·   interest rates 

·   purchases and sales of gold by central banks and other holders 

·   demand for jewelry containing gold and 

·   investment activity including speculation in gold as a commodity 

 

molybdenum prices also fluctuate widely molybdenum demand depends primarily on the global steel industry which uses the metal as a hardening and corrosion inhibiting agent approximately 80 percent of molybdenum production is used in this application the remainder is used in specialty chemical applications such as catalysts water treatment agents and lubricants approximately 60 percent of global molybdenum production is a byproduct of copper mining which is relatively insensitive to molybdenum prices during the three years ended december 31 2007 the metals week dealer oxide price for molybdenum ranged from 2050 to 4000 per pound molybdenum prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control including 

 

·   the worldwide balance of molybdenum demand and supply 

·   rates of global economic growth especially construction and infrastructure activity that requires significant amounts of steel 

·   the volume of molybdenum produced as a byproduct of copper production 

·   inventory levels 

·   currency exchange fluctuations including the relative strength of the us dollar and 

·   production costs of us and foreign competitors 

 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain provisions that limit our discretion in the operation of our business and require us to meet financial tests and other covenants in addition we are required to meet financial tests showing our capability to perform required closure and remediation the failure to comply with such tests and covenants could have a material adverse effect on us 

we incurred significant debt to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid to phelps dodge shareholders in our acquisition of phelps dodge as of december 31 2007 the outstanding principal amount of our indebtedness was 72 billion excluding unused availability under our revolving credit facilities of 14 billion after giving effect to outstanding letters of credit the agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants that restrict our ability to 

·   incur additional indebtedness 

·   engage in transactions with affiliates 

·   create liens on our assets 

·   make payments in respect of or redeem or acquire debt or equity issued by us or our subsidiaries including the payment of dividends on our common 

  stock 

·   make acquisitions of new subsidiaries 

·   make investments in or loans to entities that we do not control including joint ventures 

·   use assets as security in other transactions 

·   sell assets subject to certain exceptions 

·   merge with or into other companies 

·   enter into sale and leaseback transactions 

·   enter into unrelated businesses 

·   enter into agreements or arrangements that restrict the ability of certain of oursubsidiaries to pay dividends or other distributions 

·   prepay indebtedness and 

·   enter into certain new hedging transactions other than in the ordinary course of business 

in addition our senior credit facilities require that we meet specified financial tests at any time that borrowings or letters of credit are outstanding under our revolving credit facility including a leverage ratio test and a secured leverage ratio test 

 

any failure to comply with the restrictions of our senior credit facilities or any agreement governing our other indebtedness may result in an event of default such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt which may trigger crossacceleration or crossdefault provisions in other debt agreements our assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our debt instruments that are accelerated upon an event of default 

 

if we are unable to repay refinance or restructure our indebtedness under or amend the covenants contained in our senior credit agreements at maturity or in the event of a default the lenders under our senior credit facilities could terminate their commitments thereunder cease making further loans declare all borrowings outstanding together with accrued interest and other fees immediately due and payable and institute foreclosure proceedings against the security any such actions could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation 

 

 

in addition most of the financial assurance for our southwestern us mines is provided by financial capability demonstrations or guarantees both of which require a demonstration that we meet financial tests showing our capability to perform the required closure and remediation or ability to back guarantees provided for our subsidiaries financial capability demonstrations or guarantees have been submitted for essentially all of the financial assurance for our arizona mines we maintain a part of our financial assurance using guarantees in new mexico however a portion of our financial assurance requirements in new mexico is supplied in another form such as letters of credit real property collateral or a trust our ability to satisfy financial capability demonstrations or utilize thirdparty guarantees for financial assurance with respect to reclamation obligations may be adversely affected if our credit ratings continue to be rated below investment grade and we are unable to pass the affirmative financial tests if this w ere to occur we may be required to provide alternative forms of financial assurance such as letters of credit surety bonds real property collateral or a trust 

we need significant amounts of cash to service our debt if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to service our debt our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected 

we must generate sufficient amounts of cash to service and repay our debt our ability to generate cash will be affected by general economic financial competitive and other factors that may be beyond our control future borrowings may not be available to us under our senior credit facilities or from the capital markets in amounts sufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund other liquidity needs if we are not able to obtain such borrowings or generate sufficient cash from operations to service and repay our indebtedness we will need to refinance our indebtedness to avoid any default such refinancing may not be available on favorable terms or at all the inability to service repay or refinance our indebtedness could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

movements in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates could negatively affect our operating results 

substantially all of our revenues and a significant portion of our costs are denominated in us dollars however some of our costs and certain of our asset and liability accounts are denominated in indonesian rupiah chilean pesos peruvian nuevos soles australia dollars euros and other foreign currencies as a result we will be generally less profitable when the us dollar weakens in relation to these foreign currencies 

as of december 31 2007 approximately 18 percent of outstanding debt was subject to variable interest rates increases in these rates will increase our interest costs and reduce our profits and operating cash flows 

from time to time we may implement currency or interest rate hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange or interest rates however our hedging strategies may not be successful and any of our unhedged foreign exchange or interest payments will continue to be subject to market fluctuations 

operational risks 

the volume and grade of ore reserves that we recover and our rate of production may be more or less than anticipated in addition our exploration activities may not result in additional discoveries 

our ore reserve amounts are determined in accordance with established mining industry practices and standards and are estimates of the mineral deposits that can be recovered economically and legally based on currently available data ore bodies may not conform to standard geological expectations and estimates may change as new data becomes available because ore bodies do not contain uniform grades and types of minerals our metal recovery rates will vary from time to time there are also uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of ore reserves and copper recovered from stockpiles 

 

 

the quantity of copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records the volume and grade of ore reserves recovered rates of production and recovered copper from stockpiles may be less than anticipated additionally because the determination of reserves is based partially on historical selling prices a prospective decrease in such prices may result in a reduction in economically recoverable and therefore reported ore reserves these factors may result in variations in the volumes of mineral reserves that we report and the volume of minerals that we can sell from period to period 

 

our ability to replenish our ore reserves is important to our longterm viability our exploration programs may not result in the discovery of sufficient additional mineral deposits that can be mined profitably 

our business is subject to operational risks that are generally outside of our control and could adversely affect our business 

mines by their nature are subject to many operational risks and factors that are generally outside of our control and could adversely affect our business operating results and cash flows these operational risks and factors include the following 

 

·   unanticipated ground and water conditions 

·   adverse claims to water rights and shortages of water to which we have rights 

·   geological problems including earthquakes and other natural disasters 

·   metallurgical and other processing problems 

·   the occurrence of unusual weather or operating conditions and other force majeure events 

·   lower than expected ore grades or recovery rates 

·   accidents 

·   delays in the receipt of or failure to receive necessary government permits 

·   the results of litigation including appeals of agency decisions 

·   uncertainty of exploration and development 

·   delays in transportation 

·   interruption of energy supply 

·   labor disputes 

·   inability to hire and retain a sufficient number of skilled employees 

·   inability to obtain satisfactory insurance coverage 

·   unavailability of experienced labor equipment and materials and 

·   the failure of equipment or processes to operate in accordance with specifications or expectations 

 

continuation of our mining production is dependent on the availability of a sufficient water supply to support our mining operations 

our mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining ore processing and related support facilities our operations in north and south america are in desert areas where water is scarce and competition amoung users for continuing access to water is significant continuous production at our mines is dependent on our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and defeat claims adverse to our current water uses in legal proceedings in addition our right to use water at our us operations is subject to applicable state laws although each operation currently has sufficient water claims to cover its operational demands we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings on our water rights claims and uses the loss of some or all water rights for any of our mines in whole or in part or shortages of water to which we have rights could require us to curtail or shut down mining production and could prevent us from pursuing expansion opportunities 

 

an interruption of energy supply could adversely affect our mining operations 

our mining operations and development projects require significant energy our principal energy sources are electricity purchased petroleum products natural gas and coal our south american mining operations receive electrical power under longterm contracts with local energy companies our african development project tenke fungurume has entered into longterm power supply and infrastructure funding agreements with the stateowned electric utility company serving the katanga province of the drc a disruption in the transmission of energy inadequate energy transmission infrastructure or the termination of any of our energy supply contracts could interrupt our energy supply and adversely affect our operations 

worldwide expansion of mining activity has increased costs and created shortages of equipment supplies and experienced personnel increased production costs could reduce our profitability and cash flow 

in the last few years there has been a significant increase in mining activity worldwide to meet the demand of an expanding world economy and in response to significant increases in prices of natural resources the opening of new mines and expansion of existing mines has led to increased demand for and increased costs and shortages of equipment supplies and experienced personnel these cost increases have significantly increased overall operating and capital budgets of companies like ours and continuing shortages could affect the timing and feasibility of expansion projects 

 

energy represents a significant portion of our production costs our principal energy sources are electricity purchased petroleum products natural gas and coal an inability to procure sufficient energy at reasonable prices could adversely affect our profits cash flow and growth opportunities our production costs are also affected by the prices of commodities we consume or use in our operations such as sulfuric acid grinding media steel reagents liners explosives and diluents the prices of such commodities are influenced by supply and demand trends affecting the mining industry in general and other factors outside our control and such prices are at times subject to volatile movements increases in the cost of these commodities could make our operations less profitable even in an environment of relatively high copper prices increases in the costs of commodities that we consume or use may also significantly affect the capital costs of new projects 

in addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry our indonesian operations involve additional risks because they are located on unusually difficult terrain in a very remote area 

our grasberg mining operations are located in steep mountainous terrain in a very remote area in indonesia because of these conditions we have had to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities in addition the area receives considerable rainfall which has led to periodic floods and mudslides the mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time our insurance may not sufficiently cover an unexpected natural or operating disaster 

 

on october 9 2003 a slippage of material occurred in a section of the grasberg open pit resulting in eight fatalities on december 12 2003 a debris flow involving a relatively small amount of loose material occurred in the same section of the open pit resulting in only minor property damage the events caused us to alter our shortterm mine sequencing plans which adversely affected our 2003 and 2004 production we resumed normal production activities in the second quarter of 2004 

 

on march 23 2006 a mudtopsoil slide involving approximately 75000 metric tons of material occurred from a mountain ridge above service facilities supporting pt freeport indonesia’s mining facilities regrettably three contract workers were fatally injured in the event the material damaged a mess hall and an adjacent area as a result of investigations by pt freeport indonesia and the indonesian department of energy and mineral resources we conducted geotechnical studies to identify and address any potential hazards to workers and facilities from slides the existing early warning system for potential 

 

slides based upon rainfall and other factors has also been expanded however no assurance can be given that similar events will not occur in the future

 

development projects are inherently risky and may require more capital than anticipated which could adversely affect our business   in addition our most significant development project tenke fungurume is located in a remote area of the drc 

there are many risks and uncertainties inherent in all development projects including our significant future development of underground mines at the grasberg minerals district our tenke fungurume project and ongoing projects at our north and south american operations the economic feasibility of development projects is based on many factors including the accuracy of estimated reserves metallurgical recoveries capital and operating costs and future prices of the relevant minerals the capital expenditures and time required to develop new mines or other projects are considerable and changes in costs or construction schedules can affect project economics thus it is possible that actual costs and economic returns may differ materially from our estimates 

 

new development projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future cash flow these development projects also require the successful completion of feasibility studies acquisition of governmental permits acquisition of land power and water and ensuring that appropriate community infrastructure is developed by third parties to support such projects it is possible that we could fail to obtain the government approvals necessary for the operation of a project in which case the project may not proceed either on its original timing or at all it is not unusual for new mining operations to experience unexpected problems during the startup phase resulting in delays in producing revenue and increases in invested capital 

 

our tenke fungurume project is located in a remote area of the drc and is subject to additional challenges due to 

 

·   severely limited infrastructure including road and rail access 

·   limited and possibly unreliable energy supply 

·   security risks and 

·   limited health care in an area plagued by disease and other potential endemic health issues including malaria 

 

consequently our tenke fungurume development project may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control which could increase the cost of the project and adversely affect its ultimate contribution to our operating results 

environmental risks 

our domestic and international operations are subject to complex and evolving environmental laws and regulations and compliance with environmental and regulatory requirements involves significant costs 

our ongoing mining operations and exploration activities both in the us and elsewhere are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing exploration development production occupational health mine safety toxic substances waste disposal protection and remediation of the environment protection of endangered and protected species and other related matters compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs and we expect these costs to continue to increase in the future because of increased demand for remediation services and shortages of equipment supplies labor and other factors the federal clean air act caa has had a significant impact particularly on our domestic smelter and power plants any change in regulation of the mining industry under the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra could have a significant impact both on operational compliance and closure costs in addition environmental laws and regulations may change in ways that could adversely affect our operations or expansion opportunities 

 

in addition to compliance with environmental regulation at our operating sites we incur significant costs for remediating environmental conditions on properties that have not been operated in many years 

phelps dodge and many of its affiliates and predecessor companies have been involved in mining milling and manufacturing in the us for more than a century activities that occurred in the late 19 th century and the 20 th century prior to the advent of modern environmental laws were not subject to environmental regulation and were conducted before american industrial companies understood the longterm effects of their operations on the surrounding environment with the passage of cercla in 1980 companies like phelps dodge became legally responsible for environmental remediation on properties previously owned or operated by them irrespective of when the damage to the environment occurred or who caused it that liability is often shared on a joint and several basis with all other owners and operators meaning that each owner or operator of the property is fully responsible for the cleanup although in many cases some or all of the other historical owners or operators no longer exist do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found as a result because of our acquisition of phelps dodge in 2007 many of the subsidiary companies we now own are responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the us and we expect to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address these remediation issues we are also subject to claims for natural resource damages where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have injured natural resources as of december 31 2007 we had more than 100 active remediation projects in the us in more than 25 states 

mine closure regulations impose substantial costs on our operations 

our domestic operations are subject to various federal and state mine closure and minedland reclamation laws the requirements of these laws vary depending upon the jurisdiction in general our domestic mines are required to post increasing amounts of financial assurance as estimated costs increase to ensure the availability of funds to meet future closure and reclamation obligations 

 

our new mexico financial assurance amounts at december 31 2007 which reflected reductions for work completed through 2006 and agreed upon by the new mexico environment department and mining minerals division totaled 463 million up to 70 percent of which is in the form of guarantees issued by phelps dodge on behalf of our operating subsidiaries and the balance is in the form of real property collateral letters of credit and cash these amounts may change based on the completion of additional permitting procedures final agency determinations and the results of administrative appeals which could result in changes to the closure and reclamation plans and lead to increases in the cost estimates and our related financial assurance obligations 

 

at december 31 2007 we had accrued closure costs of approximately 152 million for our arizona operations the amount of financial assurance currently demonstrated for arizona closure and reclamation activities is approximately 147 million we have also approved minedland reclamation plans and financial assurance in place for our two colorado mines totaling approximately 81 million 

 

most of the financial assurance provided for our us mines requires that we meet financial tests that demonstrate our capability to perform the required closure and remediation or ability to back guarantees provided for our subsidiaries   financial capability demonstrations or guarantees have been submitted for essentially all of the financial assurance for our arizona mines we maintain a part of our financial assurance using guarantees in new mexico however a portion of our financial assurance requirements in new mexico is supplied in another form such as letters of credit real property collateral or a trust our ability to satisfy financial capability demonstrations or utilize thirdparty guarantees for financial assurance with respect to reclamation obligations may be adversely affected if our credit ratings continue to be rated below investment grade and we are unable to pass the affirmative financial tests if this were to occur we may be required to provide alternative form of financial assurance such as letters of credit surety bonds real property collateral or a trust 

 

in recent years many surety companies have begun to require a significant level of collateral to support surety bonds and the costs associated with such bonds have increased significantly as a result if surety bonds are unavailable at commercially reasonable terms to support our financial assurance obligations we could be required to post letters of credit other collateral or cash or cash equivalents directly in support of those obligations 

 

in addition our international mines are subject to various mine closure and minedland reclamation laws and there have recently been significant changes in closure and reclamation programs in both peru and chile that impose more stringent obligations on us for closure and reclamation 

regulation of greenhouse effects and climate change may adversely affect our operations and markets 

 

energy is a significant input to our mining and processing operations our principal energy sources are electricity purchased petroleum products natural gas and coal many scientists believe that emissions from the combustion of carbonbased fuels contribute to greenhouse effects and therefore potentially to climate change 

 

a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change the december 1997 kyoto protocol established a set of greenhouse gas emission targets for developed countries that have ratified the protocol although the kyoto protocol has not been ratified by the us several states have initiated legislative action on climate change climate change legislation has been introduced in but not yet passed by the us congress which could result in increased future energy and compliance costs from a medium and longterm perspective we are likely to see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit significant amounts of greenhouse gases as a result of regulatory initiatives in the countries in which we operate these regulatory initiatives may be either voluntary or mandatory and may impact our operations directly or through our suppliers or customers assessments of the potential impact of future climate change regulation are uncertain given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which we operate 

 

the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would be particular to the geographic circumstances these may include changes in rainfall patterns water shortages changing sea levels changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperatures these effects may adversely impact the cost production and financial performance of our operations 

our operating inactive and historical domestic mining sites and facilities may be subject to future regulation of radioactive materials that are commonly associated with or result from our mining operations 

a number of federal and state agencies are considering new regulations to characterize regulate and remediate potential workplace exposures and environmental impacts of radioactive materials commonly associated with mining operations for example the epa intends to promulgate rules to regulate technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive materials tenorm and their impacts at mining operations in addition several states are promulgating groundwater quality compliance and remediation standards for radioactive materials including uranium radioactive materials can be associated with copper mineral deposits consequently our copper operations may generate concentrate or release radioactive materials that may subject our operations to new and increased regulation the impact of such future regulation on our operating closure reclamation and remediation costs is uncertain 

our mining operations in indonesia create difficult and costly environmental challenges and future changes in environmental laws or unanticipated environmental impacts from those operations could require us to incur increased costs 

mining operations on the scale of our operations in papua involve significant environmental risks and challenges our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of crushed and ground rock material 

 

 

called tailings that results from the process by which we physically separate the copper gold and silverbearing materials from the ore that we mine our tailings management plan which has been approved by the government of indonesia uses the river system near our mine to transport the tailings to the lowlands where the tailings and natural sediments are deposited in a controlled area contained within an engineered levee system that will be revegetated 

another major environmental challenge is managing overburden which is the rock that must be moved aside in the mining process in order to reach the ore in the presence of air water and naturally occurring bacteria some overburden can cause acid rock drainage or acidic water containing dissolved metals which if not properly managed can have a negative impact on the environment 

 

certain indonesian governmental officials have from time to time raised issues with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans including a suggestion that we implement a pipeline system rather than our river deposition system for tailings disposal because our mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area a pipeline system would be costly difficult to construct and maintain and more prone to catastrophic failure and could therefore involve significant potentially adverse environmental issues based on our own studies and others conducted by third parties we do not believe that a pipeline system is necessary or practical 

 

in march 2006 the indonesian ministry of environment announced the preliminary results of its proper program for pollution control evaluation and rating environmental management audit acknowledging the effectiveness of pt freeport indonesia’s environmental management practices in some areas while making several suggestions for improvement in others we are working with the ministry of environment to address the issues raised as it completes the audit process 

international risks 

our operations outside of the united states are subject to political social and geographic risks of doing business in foreign countries 

we are a global mining company with substantial assets located outside of the united states we conduct international mining operations in indonesia chile and peru we also have a significant development project in the drc which is expected to begin production in 2009 accordingly our business may be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties in each of these countries in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in foreign countries such risks include 1 forced modification of existing contracts 2 expropriation 3 changes in a country’s laws and policies including those relating to labor taxation royalties divestment imports exports trade regulations currency and environmental matters 4 political instability and civil strife 5 exchange controls and 6 the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel or having to enforce the judgment of a foreign court or arbitration panel against a sovereign nation within its own territory our insurance does not cover most losses caused by these risks 

because our grasberg mine in papua indonesia remains our most significant operating asset our business may continue to be adversely affected by indonesian political economic and social uncertainties 

indonesia has faced political economic and social uncertainties including separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces in particular several separatist groups are opposing indonesian rule over the province of papua where our grasberg mine is located and have sought political independence for the province in response indonesia enacted regional autonomy laws which became effective january 1 2001 the manner in which the new laws are being implemented and the degree of political and economic autonomy that they may bring to individual provinces including papua are uncertain and are ongoing issues in indonesian politics in papua there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the indonesian military social economic and political instability in papua could materially and adversely affect us if it results in damage to our property or interruption of our activities 

 

maintaining a good working relationship with the indonesian government is important to us because our mining operations there are among indonesia’s most significant business enterprises and are conducted pursuant to a contract of work with the indonesian government partially because of their significance to indonesia’s economy the environmentally sensitive area in which they are located and the number of people employed our operations are occasionally the subject of criticism in the indonesian press and in political debates and have been the target of protests and occasional violence 

 

grasberg operated at reduced mining and milling rates during a fourday period from april 18 2007 to april 21 2007 as a result of peaceful protests by certain workers regarding benefits the protests ended on april 21 with an agreement on a framework for minimum wages for its workers and grasberg returned to normal operations the impacts to production were not significant 

 

we cannot predict whether additional incidents will occur that could disrupt our indonesian operations or whether similar incidents may occur in other countries that could affect our other operations if additional protests or other disruptive incidents occur at any of our facilities they could adversely affect our business and profitability in ways that we cannot predict at this time 

we do not expect to mine all of our indonesian ore reserves before the initial term of our contract of work in indonesia expires 

all of our indonesian proven and probable ore reserves including the grasberg deposit are located in block a the initial term of our contract of work covering these ore reserves expires at the end of 2021 we can extend this term for two successive 10year periods subject to the approval of the indonesian government which under our contract of work cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably our ore reserves reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041 ie through the expiration of the two 10year extensions and our current mine plan has been developed and our operations are based on the assumption that we will receive the two 10year extensions as a result we will not mine all of these ore reserves during the current term of our contract of work and there can be no assurance that the indonesian government will approve the extensions prior to the end of 2021 we expect to mine approximately 37 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable ore at december 31 2007 representing approximately 43 percent of pt freeport indonesia’s share of recoverable copper reserves and approximately 57 percent of its share of recoverable gold reserves 

our contracts of work in indonesia are subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations and if a dispute arises we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel 

pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work and other contracts of work in which we have an interest were entered into under indonesia’s 1967 foreign capital investment law which provides guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization our contracts of work can be terminated by the government of indonesia if we do not satisfy our contractual obligations which include the payment of royalties and taxes to the government and the satisfaction of certain mining environmental safety and health requirements 

 

at times certain government officials and others in indonesia have questioned the validity of contracts entered into by the government of indonesia prior to may 1998 ie during the suharto regime which lasted over 30 years including pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work which was signed in december 1991 we cannot assure you that the validity of or our compliance with the contracts of work will not be challenged for political or other reasons pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work and our other contracts of work require that disputes with the indonesian government be submitted to international arbitration consequently if a dispute arises under the contracts of work we face the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel and if we prevail in such a dispute we will face the additional risk of having to enforce the judgment of a foreign court or arbitration panel against indonesia within its own territory 

 

indonesian government officials have periodically undertaken reviews regarding our compliance with indonesian environmental laws and regulations and the terms of the contracts of work in 2006 the government of indonesia created a joint team for “periodic evaluation on implementation of the ptfi contract of work cow” to conduct an evaluation every five years the team consists of five working groups whose members are from relevant ministries or agencies covering production state revenues community development environmental issues and security issues we have conducted numerous meetings with these groups the joint team has indicated that it will issue a report while we believe that we comply with pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work in all material respects we cannot assure you that the report will support that conclusion separately the indonesian house of representatives created a working committee on pt freeport indonesia members of this group have also visited our operations and held a number of hearings in jakarta we will continue to work with these groups to respond to their questions about our operations and our compliance with pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work 

any suspension of required activities under our contracts of work requires the consent of the indonesian government 

our contracts of work permit us to suspend certain contractually required activities including exploration for a period of one year by making a written request to the indonesian government these requests are subject to the approval of the indonesian government and are renewable annually if we do not request a suspension or are denied a suspension then we are required to continue our activities under the contract of work or potentially be declared in default moreover if a suspension continues for more than one year for reasons other than force majeure and the indonesian government has not approved such continuation then the government would be entitled to declare a default under the contract of work 

 

we suspended our field exploration activities outside of block a in recent years because of safety and security issues and regulatory uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest areas and an indonesian forestry law enacted in 1999 prohibiting openpit mining in forest preservation areas in 2001 we requested and received from the government of indonesia formal temporary suspensions of our obligations under the contracts of work in all areas outside of block a recent indonesian legislation permits openpit mining in pt freeport indonesia’s block b area subject to certain requirements following an assessment of these requirements and a review of security issues in 2007 we resumed exploration activities in certain prospective contract of work areas outside of block a 

our tenke fungurume development project is located in the drc and our business may be adversely affected by political economic and social instability in the drc 

 

our most significant development project tenke fungurume is located in the drc a nation that since 1960 has undergone outbreaks of political violence changes in national leadership and financial crisis these factors heighten the risk of abrupt changes in the national policy towards foreign investors which in turn could result in unilateral modification of concessions or contracts increased taxation denial of permits or permit renewals or expropriation of assets our ability to continue development is currently subject to an ongoing review of all mining contracts by the ministry of mines in the drc ministry the outcome of which cannot be predicted we received notification on february 20 2008 that the ministry wishes to renegotiate several material provisions of our mining concessions we believe that the terms of the concessions are fair and that they were negotiated transparently and are legally binding however we cannot predict whether the government of the drc will respect our contract rights other political economic and social risks that are outside of our control and could adversely affect our business include 

 

·   political risks associated with the limited tenure of the newly elected government 

·   cancellation or renegotiation of mining contracts by the government 

·   royalty and tax increases or claims by governmental entities including retroactive claims 

·   security risks due to the remote location and violence in the northeastern provinces of thedrc 

·   risk of loss of property due to expropriation or nationalization of property and 

·   risk of loss due to civil strife acts of war guerrilla activities insurrection and terrorism 

 

 

consequently our tenke fungurume development project may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control any of which could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 

terrorist attacks throughout the world and the potential for additional future terrorist acts have created economic and political uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business 

on august 31 2002 three people were killed and 11 others were wounded in an ambush by a group of unidentified assailants on the road near tembagapura the mining town where the majority of pt freeport indonesia’s personnel reside the assailants shot at several vehicles transporting international contract teachers from our school in tembagapura their family members and other contractors to pt freeport indonesia the us fbi investigated the incident which resulted in the us indictment of an alleged operational commander of the free papua movementnational freedom force in january 2006 indonesian police accompanied by fbi agents arrested the alleged operational commander and 11 other papuans in november 2006 verdicts and sentencing were announced for seven of those accused in the august 2002 shooting including a life sentence for the confessed leader of the attack 

 

on october 12 2002 a bombing killed 202 people in the indonesian province of bali which is 1500 miles west of our mining and milling operations indonesian authorities arrested 35 people in connection with this bombing and 29 of those arrested have been tried and convicted on august 5 2003 12 people were killed and over 100 were injured by a car bomb detonated outside of the jw marriott hotel in jakarta indonesia on september 9 2004 11 people were killed and over 200 injured by a car bomb detonated in front of the australian embassy in jakarta on october 1 2005 three suicide bombers killed 19 people and wounded over 100 in bali the same international terrorist organizations are suspected in each of these incidents in november 2005 indonesian police raided a house in east java that resulted in the death of other accused terrorists linked to the bombings discussed above our mining and milling operations were not interrupted by these incidents but pt freeport indonesia’s corporate office in jakarta had to relocate for several months following the bombing in front of the australian embassy in addition to the bali jw marriott hotel and australian embassy bombings there have been antiamerican demonstrations in certain sections of indonesia reportedly led by radical islamic activists 

other risks 

the impact of purchase accounting in connection with our acquisition of phelps dodge in march 2007 will adversely affect our reported earnings 

 

purchase accounting requires us to allocate the price paid for the acquisition of phelps dodge to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values on the acquisition date of march 19 2007 this allocation resulted in significant increases in the carrying values of certain acquired assets including based on preliminary estimates increases of approximately 28 billion in metal inventories and stockpiles and approximately 161 billion in property plant and equipment although these increases in metal inventories and stockpiles and property plant and equipment do not impact our cash flows the increases in metal inventories and stockpiles had a significant impact to our reported earnings in 2007 and the increases in property plant and equipment had a significant impact on our reported earnings in 2007 and will continue to have an impact on reported earnings 

 

a decline in copper or molybdenum prices from those used to estimate the fair values of the acquired assets could result in impairment to the carrying values of metal and stockpile inventories and property plant and equipment these charges would reduce reported earnings but would have no effect on cash flows 

 

in addition at december 31 2007 the carrying value of goodwill associated with the acquisition of phelps dodge totaled 61 billion absent the occurrence of events or circumstances in an interim period that may indicate impairment we are required to evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis if we 

 

conclude that the goodwill associated with the transaction is impaired the amount of the impairment would be charged to our reported earnings but would have no effect on cash flows 

we depend on our senior management team and other key employees and the loss of any of these employees could adversely affect our business 

our success depends in part on our ability to retain senior management and other key employees competition for qualified personnel can be very intense in addition senior management and key employees may depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty or difficulty associated with the successful integration of the business and operations as formerly conducted by phelps dodge or a desire not to remain with us accordingly no assurance can be given that we will be able to retain senior management and key employees to the same extent that we have been able to do so in the past 

our holding company structure may impact your ability to receive dividends  

we are a holding company with no material assets other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries as a result our ability to repay our indebtedness and pay dividends is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to make funds available to us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends in addition our subsidiaries may not be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries’ assets upon their liquidation reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries’ creditors including any trade creditors and preferred shareholders 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult these provisions 

 

·   authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval andto designate the rights preferences and privileges of each 

  class if issued such preferredstock would increase the number of outstanding shares of our capital stock and could include terms that may deter an 

  acquisition of us 

·   establish advanced notice requirements for nominations to the board of directors or forproposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and 

·   limit who may call stockholder meetings 

 

in addition because we are incorporated in delaware we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with or acquisition of us 

 

these provisions may deter an acquisition of us that might otherwise be attractive to stockholders 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

not applicable 







 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings of a character normally incident to the ordinary course of our business we believe that potential liability in such proceedings would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations we maintain liability insurance 

 

 

to cover some but not all potential liabilities normally incident to the ordinary course of our business as well as other insurance coverage customary in our business with coverage limits that we deem prudent 

environmental proceedings 

pinal creek   the pinal creek site located near miami arizona was listed under the arizona department of environmental quality’s adeq water quality assurance revolving fund program in 1989 for contamination in the shallow alluvial aquifers within the pinal creek drainage near miami arizona since that time environmental remediation has been performed by members of the pinal creek group pcg consisting of phelps dodge miami inc pdmi a wholly owned subsidiary of phelps dodge and two other companies in 1998 the district court approved a consent decree between the pcg members and the state of arizona resolving all matters related to an enforcement action contemplated by the state of arizona against the pcg members with respect to groundwater the consent decree committed the pcg members to complete the remediation work outlined in the consent decree that work continues at this time pursuant to the consent decree and consistent with state law and the national contingency plan prepared by the us environmental protection agency epa under cercla 

 

the pcg members have been pursuing contribution litigation against three other parties involved with the site pdmi dismissed its contribution claims against one defendant when another pcg member agreed to be responsible for any share attributable to that defendant pdmi and the other pcg members settled their contribution claims against another defendant in april 2005 while the terms of the settlement are confidential the proceeds of the settlement will be used to address remediation at the pinal creek site there are significant disagreements among the members of the pcg regarding the allocation of the cost of remediation and a trial on that issue is currently scheduled to begin in late 2008 the overall cost of the clean up is expected to be significant 

 

arizona notice of violation nov – sierrita operations    in september and october 2006 adeq issued two novs to the phelps dodge sierrita inc sierrita operations in southeastern arizona the two novs alleged certain visibility and permit violations associated with dust emissions from sierrita’s tailing facility during highwind events no action has been filed at this time and sierrita has responded to the novs by acknowledging that dust likely did exceed a visibility standard but denying the other allegations sierrita has implemented response actions that adeq has accepted and has entered into discussions with adeq to seek to resolve the novs 

 

epa notice re violation of consent decree – sierrita operations    in september 2006 epa notified sierrita of the possible assessment of stipulated penalties arising from deviations from certain provisions of a consent decree dated june 21 2004 by and among pdsi the united states and adeq entitled united states and the state of arizona v phelps dodge sierrita inc no civ 04312 tuc frz in november 2007 sierrita paid stipulated penalties of 140500 to epa and adeq as a condition to a joint request to the federal court for termination of the consent decree 

 

new mexico environment department – chino mines  on october 24 2007 chino mines co chino notified nmed that heavy rains during july august and september led to a release of diluted leach solutions through a storm water outfall to an ephemeral stream on chino’s property chino sent a follow up notice to nmed on november 7 2007 which identified the interim corrective actions taken as a result of the discharge on february 28 2008 chino received a proposed administrative compliance order which included a demand for civil penalties in the amount of 276600 for violation of legal requirements in connection with chino’s management of the solutions chino is preparing a response to nmed 

 

asbestos claims 

since approximately 1990 phelps dodge and various other subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a large number of product liability or premises lawsuits claiming injury from exposure to asbestos contained 

 

 

in electrical wire products produced or marketed many years ago or from asbestos at certain phelps dodge properties based on information available to us to date we believe our liability if any in these matters will not have a material adverse effect either individually or in the aggregate upon our business financial condition liquidity results of operations or cash flow there can be no assurance however that future developments will not alter this conclusion 

antitrust claims 

columbian chemical company columbian formerly a subsidiary of phelps dodge and several other companies were named as defendants in an action entitled technical industries inc v cabot corporation et al  no civ 0310191 wgy filed on january 30 2003 in the us district court in boston massachusetts and 14 other actions filed in four us district courts on behalf of a purported class of all individuals or entities who purchased carbon black directly from the defendants since january 1999 all of these actions were consolidated in the us district court for the district of massachusetts under the caption in re carbon black antitrust litigation  on september 27 2007 the court entered an order approving a proposed settlement and dismissing with prejudice all claims against columbian and other defendants in these actions 

 

columbian and the other defendants entered into an agreement to settle the separate action entitled carlisle companies incorporated et al v cabot corporation et al  which was filed against columbian and other defendants on behalf of a group of affiliated companies that opted out of the federal class action all claims in that action were dismissed with prejudice on october 16 2007 

 

columbian and the other defendants have also settled state law claims filed on behalf of purported classes of indirect purchasers of carbon black in california tennessee and kansas and six other states represented by kansas counsel similar actions filed in new jersey and north carolina have been dismissed actions remain pending in state courts in florida and south dakota threatened litigation in massachusetts has not been initiated we retained responsibility for these claims in the agreement pursuant to which we sold columbian and we have paid an aggregate of 7 million to settle the claims referenced above columbian and the other defendants are attempting to negotiate a resolution of the remaining state lawsuits 

water rights 

water law in the western us is generally based on the doctrine of prior appropriation first in time first in right and permits the water right holder the right to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location our operations in the western us require water for mining ore processing and related support facilities continuous operation of these mines is dependent on our ability to maintain our water rights and claims the loss of water rights in whole or in part could have a significant adverse affect on our mining operations 

arizona 

 

two water rights adjudications have been initiated in the state of arizona in order to quantify and prioritize all surface water claims in two of the state’s river systems that include four of our mines morenci sierrita safford and miami and which may affect our bagdad arizona mine these adjudications have proceeded for many years and we cannot predict when they will be concluded but the loss of any water claims in these legal proceedings could have a significant adverse affect on the operations of these mines 

 

in re the general adjudication of all rights to use water in the little colorado water system and sources  apache county superior court no 6417 filed on or about february 17 1978 the principal parties in addition to phelps dodge include the state of arizona the salt river project the arizona public service company the navajo nation the hopi indian tribe the san juan southern paiute tribe and the united states on its own behalf on behalf of those indian tribes and on behalf of the white mountain apache tribe 

 

in re the general adjudication of all rights to use water in the gila river system and sources  

maricopa county superior court cause nos w1 salt w2 verde w3 upper gila and w4 san pedro filed on february 17 1978 the principal parties in addition to us include the state of arizona the gila valley irrigation district the san carlos irrigation and drainage district the salt river project the san carlos apache tribe the gila river indian community and the united states on behalf of those tribes on its own behalf and on behalf of the white mountain apache tribe the fort mcdowell mohaveapache indian community the salt river pimamaricopa indian community and the payson community of yavapai apache indians 

 

in 1998 we entered into a water rights settlement agreement with the gila river indian community gric which was later included in a comprehensive water rights settlement under the arizona water settlements act of 2004 the gric settlement is subject to contingencies that must be met before the agreement is fully effective and the comprehensive settlement has been challenged by other parties if we are unable to resolve the contingencies in the gric settlement and defeat the thirdparty challenges our water rights in the gila river watershed could be diminished and our operations at morenci safford sierrita and miami could be adversely affected 

 

prior to january 1 1983 various indian tribes filed suits in us district court in arizona claiming superior rights to water being used by many other water users including us and claiming damages for prior use in derogation of their allegedly superior rights these federal proceedings have been stayed pending the arizona superior court adjudications 

 

united states v gila valley irrigation district  united states district court district of arizona was initiated in 1925 by the united states to settle conflicting claims to water rights in portions of the gila river watershed a decree settling the claims of various parties was entered in 1935 after phelps dodge morenci had been dismissed from the case with the court retaining jurisdiction in 1988 the gila river indian community intervened challenging uses of water in the gila river watershed which may impact approximately 3000 acrefeet of water that we have the right to divert annually from eagle creek chase creek or the san francisco river for operation of our morenci mine pursuant to decreed rights and an agreement between us and the gila valley irrigation district our morenci operations also purchased farm lands with water rights in 1997 1998 and 2007 that are subject to this proceeding impairment of our water claims in the gila river watershed could adversely affect the operation of our morenci and safford mines

general 

through our majorityowned subsidiary pt freeport indonesia we have one of the world’s largest copper and gold mining and production operations in terms of reserves and production our principal asset is the grasberg minerals district we discovered the largest ore body in the district grasberg in 1988 based on available yearend 2005 data provided by thirdparty industry consultants the grasberg minerals district contains the largest single copper reserve and the largest single gold reserve of any mine in the world 

our principal operating subsidiary is pt freeport indonesia a limited liability company organized under the laws of the republic of indonesia and incorporated in delaware we own approximately 9064 percent of pt freeport indonesia and the government of indonesia owns the remaining approximate 936 percent pt freeport indonesia mines processes and explores for ore containing copper gold and silver it operates in the remote highlands of the sudirman mountain range in the province of papua indonesia which is on the western half of the island of new guinea pt freeport indonesia markets its concentrates containing copper gold and silver worldwide 

pt freeport indonesia conducts its operations pursuant to an agreement called a contract of work with the government of indonesia see “contracts of work” the contract of work allows us to conduct extensive mining production and exploration activities in a 24700acre area that we call block a which contains the grasberg minerals district and governs our rights and obligations relating to taxes exchange controls royalties repatriation and other matters the contract of work also allows us to explore for minerals in an approximately 500000acre area that we call block b exploration activities in block b have been suspended in recent years but we expect to resume those activities in 2007 the primary term of our contract of work expires in 2021 and we can extend it for two 10year periods subject to indonesian government approval which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably 

another of our operating subsidiaries pt irja eastern minerals which we refer to as eastern minerals holds an additional contract of work in papua covering approximately 12 million acres eastern minerals conducts exploration activities which had been suspended in recent years under this contract of work see “contracts of work” in december 2006 eastern minerals received approval from the government of indonesia to resume exploration activities in 2007 we have a 100 percent ownership interest in eastern minerals 

in 1996 we established joint ventures with rio tinto plc which is an international mining company with headquarters in london england rio tinto conducts mining operations in north america south america asia australia europe and southern africa one of our joint ventures with rio tinto covers pt freeport indonesia ’s mining operations in block a this joint venture gives rio tinto through 2021 a 40 percent interest in certain assets and in production above specified levels from operations in block a and after 2021 a 40 percent interest in all production in block a under our joint venture arrangements rio tinto also has a 40 percent interest in pt freeport indonesia ’s contract of work and eastern minerals ’ contract of work in addition rio tinto has the 

 

 

option to participate in 40 percent of any of our other future exploration projects in papua to date rio tinto has elected to participate in all exploration projects including pt nabire bakti mining 

under a joint venture agreement through pt nabire bakti mining we conduct exploration activities which have been suspended in recent years see “contracts of work” in an area covering approximately 500000 acres in five parcels contiguous to pt freeport indonesia ’s block b and one of eastern minerals ’ blocks we expect to resume exploration activities in pt nabire bakti mining ’s exploration area in 2007 

at december 31 2006 pt freeport indonesia’s share of proven and probable recoverable reserves totaled 388 billion pounds of copper and 411 million ounces of gold all of which are located in block a our approximate 9064 percent equity share of these proven and probable recoverable reserves totaled 352 billion pounds of copper and 372 million ounces of gold see “ore reserves” in this annual report we refer to 1 aggregate reserves which means all reserves for the operations we manage 2 pt freeport indonesia’s share of reserves which means the reserves net of rio tinto’s interest under our joint venture arrangements and which are the reserves reported as those of our operations in our consolidated financial statements and 3 our equity share of reserves which is net of the 936 percent of pt freeport indonesia owned by the government of indonesia 

in july 2003 we acquired the 857 percent ownership interest in pt puncakjaya power owned by affiliates of duke energy corporation puncakjaya power is the owner of assets supplying power to pt freeport indonesia’s operations including the 3x65 megawatt coalfired power facilities see “infrastructure” 

we also smelt and refine copper concentrates in spain and market the refined copper products through our wholly owned subsidiary atlantic copper sa in addition pt freeport indonesia has a 25 percent interest in pt smelting an indonesian company that operates a copper smelter and refinery in gresik indonesia these smelters play an important role in our concentrate marketing strategy as approximately onehalf of pt freeport indonesia ’s concentrate production has been sold to atlantic copper and pt smelting over the last several years see “investment in smelters”

contracts of work 

through contracts of work with the government of indonesia pt freeport indonesia and eastern minerals conduct their current exploration operations and pt freeport indonesia conducts its mining operations in indonesia both contracts of work govern our rights and obligations relating to taxes exchange controls royalties repatriation and other matters both contracts of work were concluded pursuant to the 1967 foreign capital investment law which expresses indonesia ’s foreign investment policy and provides basic guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization a framework for economic incentives and basic rules regarding other rights and obligations of foreign investors specifically the contracts of work provide that the government of indonesia will not nationalize or expropriate pt freeport indonesia ’s or eastern minerals’ mining operations any disputes regarding the provisions of the contracts of work are subject to international arbitration we have experienced no disputes requiring arbitration during the 39 years we have operated in indonesia 

pt freeport indonesia ’s contract of work covers both block a which was first included in a 1967 contract of work that was replaced by a new contract of work in 1991 and block b to which we gained rights in 1991 the initial term of our contract of work expires in december 2021 but we can extend it for two 10year periods subject to indonesian government approval which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably we originally had the rights to explore 65 million acres in block b but pursuant to the contract of work we have only retained the rights to approximately 500000 acres following significant geological assessment 

eastern minerals signed its contract of work in august 1994 the contract of work originally covered approximately 25 million acres eastern minerals contract of work provides for a fourtoseven year exploratory term and a 30year term for mining operations subject to indonesian government approval which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably we can extend this period for two 10year periods eastern minerals’ contract of work requires us to relinquish our rights to 25 percent of the original 25millionacre contract of work area at the end of each of three specified periods as of december 31 2006 we had relinquished approximately 13 million acres and must relinquish an additional 06 million acres at the end of the threeyear exploration period which can be extended by the government of indonesia for as many as two additional years the exploration activities under eastern minerals’ contract of work also had been suspended in recent years however in december 2006 eastern minerals received approval from the government of indonesia to resume exploration activities in 2007 

we suspended our exploration activities outside of block a in recent years because of safety and security issues and regulatory uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest areas and an indonesian forestry law enacted in 1999 prohibiting openpit mining in forest preservation areas in 2001 we requested and received from the government of indonesia formal temporary suspensions of our obligations under the contracts of work in all areas outside block a the current suspensions were granted for oneyear periods ending february 26 2007 for block b and march 30 2007 for pt nabire bakti mining recent indonesian legislation permits openpit mining in pt freeport indonesia ’s block b area subject to certain requirements following an assessment of these requirements and a review of security issues we plan to resume exploration activities in certain prospective contract of work areas outside of block a in 2007 

pt freeport indonesia pays a copper royalty under its contact of work that varies from 15 percent of copper net revenue at a copper price of 090 or less per pound to 35 percent at a copper price of 110 or more per pound the contract of work royalty rate for gold and silver sales is 10 percent 

a large part of the mineral royalties under government of indonesia regulations are designated to the provinces from which the minerals are extracted in connection with our “fourth concentrator mill expansion” pt freeport indonesia agreed to pay the government of indonesia additional royalties royalties not required by our contract of work to provide further support to the local governments and the people of papua pt freeport indonesia pays the additional royalties on production exceeding specified annual amounts of copper gold and silver expected to be generated when its milling facilities operate above 200000 metric tons of ore per day the additional royalty for copper equals the contract of work royalty rate and for gold and silver equals twice the contract of work royalty rates therefore our royalty rate on copper net revenues from production above the agreed levels is double the contract of work royalty rate and our royalty rates on gold and silver sales from production above the agreed levels are triple the contract of work royalty rates 

pt freeport indonesia ’s share of the combined royalties including the additional royalties which became effective january 1 1999 totaled 1260 million in 2006 1037 million in 2005 and 435 million in 2004 

republic of indonesia 

general the republic of indonesia consists of more than 17000 islands stretching 3000 miles along the equator from malaysia to australia and is the fourth most populous nation in the world with over 245 million people following many years of dutch colonial rule indonesia gained independence in 1945 and now has a presidential republic system of government 

our mining complex was indonesia ’s first copper mining project and was the first major foreign investment in indonesia following the economic development program instituted by the indonesian government in 1967 we work closely with the central provincial and local governments in development efforts in the area surrounding our operations we have had positive relations with the indonesian government since we commenced business activities in indonesia in 1967 and we intend to continue to maintain positive working relationships with the central provincial and local branches of the indonesian government 

political developments in may 1998 president suharto indonesia ’s political leader for more than 30 years resigned in the wake of an economic crisis in indonesia and other parts of southeast asia and in the face of growing social unrest vice president bj habibie succeeded suharto in june 1999 indonesia held a new parliamentary election on a generally peaceful basis as the first step in the process of electing a new president in october 1999 in accordance with the indonesian constitution the country ’s highest political institution the people ’s consultative assembly composed of the newly elected national parliament along with additional provincial and other representatives elected abdurrahman wahid as president and megawati sukarnoputri as vice president 

in july 2001 the people ’s consultative assembly voted to remove president wahid and elected vice president megawati sukarnoputri as president in october 2004 susilo bambang yudhoyono was elected as president in the nation’s first direct presidential election 

other developments in february 2006 a group of illegal gold panners engaged in conflict with indonesian police and pt freeport indonesia security personnel when they were requested to leave an area near our milling facilities following the incident the illegal panners blocked the road leading to the grasberg mine and mill in protest and we temporarily suspended mining and milling operations as a precautionary measure the panners also vandalized some of our light vehicles and offices near this area causing approximately 2 million in damages our port facilities continued to operate during the disruption and concentrate shipments were not affected the panners mostly papuans from outside our area of operations presented a list of aspirations primarily relating to their desire to share in the benefits of our existing initiatives and programs provided for the papuans who are the traditional residents of our operations area mining and milling operations resumed after an approximate fourday outage during the incident at our mine and mill protestors in jakarta vandalized the entrance floor of the office building housing our indonesian headquarters and staged a threeday rally outside the building the indonesian police handled this matter which did not disrupt our administrative functions or damage any of our facilities 

on august 31 2002 three people were killed and 11 others were wounded in an ambush by a group of assailants the assailants shot at several vehicles transporting international contract teachers from pt freeport indonesia ’s school in tembagapura their family members and other contractors to pt freeport indonesia on the road near tembagapura the mining town where the majority of pt freeport indonesia ’s personnel reside indonesian authorities and the united states federal bureau of investigation fbi investigated the incident which resulted in the us indictment of an alleged operational commander in the free papua movementnational freedom force in january 2006 indonesian police arrested this individual and 11 other papuans in november 2006 verdicts and sentencing were announced for seven of the accused in the august 2002 shooting including a life sentence for the confessed leader of the attack 

on october 12 2002 a bombing killed 202 people in the indonesian province of bali which is 1500 miles west of our mining and milling operations indonesian authorities arrested 35 people in connection with this bombing and 29 of those arrested have been tried and convicted on august 5 2003 12 people were killed and over 100 others were injured by a car bomb detonated outside of the jw marriott hotel in jakarta indonesia on september 9 2004 11 people were killed and over 200 others injured by a car bomb detonated in front of the australian embassy on october 1 2005 three suicide bombers killed 19 people and wounded over 100 others in bali international terrorist organizations are suspected in each of these incidents in november 2005 indonesian police raided a house in east java that resulted in the death of other accused terrorists linked to these bombings our mining and milling operations were not interrupted by these incidents but our corporate offices in jakarta sustained damages and relocated for several months as a result of the september 2004 bombing 

 

the government of indonesia which provides security for pt freeport indonesia ’s personnel and operations see “security matters” has expressed a strong commitment to protect natural resources businesses operating in indonesia including pt freeport indonesia with heightened security following the incidents discussed above 

economic and social conditions the indonesian economy grew by an estimated 6 percent in 2006 and 2005 the indonesian currency the rupiah averaged approximately 9150 rupiah to one united states us dollar during 2006 and closed at 8989 rupiah to one us dollar on december 29 2006 compared with 9825 rupiah to one us dollar on december 30 2005 

despite gradual improvements on the economic front indonesia ’s recovery remains vulnerable to ongoing political and social tensions proindependence movements have been prominent in certain areas especially in the province of aceh and to a lesser extent in papua in 2005 the government of indonesia and the free aceh movement reached a peace agreement which included the withdrawal of 24000 military troops from aceh subsequently the us restored full relations with the indonesian military after a 14year moratorium partly because of the successes by the government of indonesia in fighting terrorism and in reaching a peaceful agreement in aceh 

the area surrounding our mining development is sparsely populated by indigenous people and former residents of other areas of indonesia some of whom have resettled in papua under the government of indonesia ’s transmigration program a segment of the local population is opposing indonesian rule over papua and several separatist groups have sought political independence for the province in addition to the august 31 2002 shooting incident there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the indonesian military in papua 

in 2001 new autonomy laws became effective in indonesia the laws were intended to shift a greater share of revenues and greater control of economic regulatory and social affairs to indonesia’s 31 provinces and over 300 regencies the central government and the provinces continue to consider the implementation and administration of these new responsibilities 

our contracts of work and the government of indonesia the indonesian government has assured investors that existing contracts would be honored in our 39 years of operating in indonesia the indonesian government has always honored its commitments to us our belief that our contracts of work will continue to be honored is further supported by us laws which prohibit us aid to countries that nationalize property owned by or take steps to nullify a contract with a us citizen or company at least 50 percent owned by us citizens if the foreign country does not within a reasonable time take appropriate steps to provide full value compensation or other relief under international law 

in july 2004 we received a request from the indonesian department of energy and mineral resources that we offer to sell shares in pt indocopper investama to indonesian nationals at fair market value pt indocopper investama which we wholly own has an approximate 936 percent ownership interest in pt freeport indonesia in response to this request and in view of the potential benefits of having additional indonesian ownership in our operations we have agreed to consider a potential sale of an interest in pt indocopper investama at fair market value neither our contract of work nor indonesian law requires us to divest any portion of our ownership interest in pt freeport indonesia or pt indocopper investama 

our investment in indonesia and papua we have a boardapproved policy on social employment and human rights and have comprehensive and extensive social cultural and community development programs to which we have committed significant financial and managerial resources see “social development employment and human rights” these policies and programs are designed to address the impact of our operations on the local villages and people and to provide assistance for the development of the local people while we believe these efforts serve to avoid damage to and disruptions of our operations our operations could be adversely affected by social economic and political forces beyond our control 

pt freeport indonesia contributes to the economies of papua and the republic of indonesia through the payment of taxes dividends and royalties economic development programs infrastructure development employment and the purchase of local and national goods pt freeport indonesia has frequently been one of the largest taxpayers in the republic of indonesia in addition it pays royalties on all minerals removed from the ground royalty payments are based on the volumes and prices of minerals sold in accordance with the terms of pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work as discussed above 

 

since it began development activities more than 35 years ago pt freeport indonesia has made significant investments in infrastructure both for its use and for use by the papuan public these infrastructure improvements include medical facilities roads an airport and heliports schools housing community buildings and places of worship 

pt freeport indonesia is also one of the largest private employers in indonesia and by far the largest in papua as of december 31 2006 pt freeport indonesia directly employed 8957 people and 6141 contract workers provided services to pt freeport indonesia in addition 4579 persons worked for privatized companies providing services within pt freeport indonesia ’s operations area 

besides the estimated 51 billion in direct benefits from taxes royalties dividends and fees paid to the indonesian government under the contract of work from 1992 through 2006 pt freeport indonesia’s operations have provided an additional estimated 111 billion during this period in indirect benefits to papua and the republic of indonesia in the form of wages and benefits paid to workers purchases of goods and services charitable contributions and reinvestments in operations for 2006 direct benefits paid to the indonesian government totaled approximately 16 billion and indirect benefits totaled approximately 11 billion in addition approximately 02 billion of direct benefits attributable to 2006 operations is being paid during the first quarter of 2007 in accordance with the terms of the contract of work 

ore reserves 

during 2006 pt freeport indonesia added 418 million metric tons of ore averaging 066 percent copper and 070 grams per metric ton gt of gold associated with positive drilling results at the mill level zone and deep mill level zone deposits a 387millionmetricton complex with average grades of 102 percent copper and 081 gt of gold pt freeport indonesia’s reserve estimates also reflect revisions resulting from changes to its longrange mine plans 

during the fourth quarter of 2006 pt freeport indonesia completed an analysis of its longerrange mine plans to assess the optimal design of the grasberg open pit and the timing of development of the grasberg underground block cave ore body the analysis incorporated the latest geological and geotechnical studies costs and other economic factors in developing the optimal timing for transitioning from the open pit to underground the revised longrange plan includes changes to the expected final grasberg openpit design which will result in a section of highgrade ore previously expected to be mined in the open pit to be mined in the grasberg underground block cave mine approximately 100 million metric tons of highgrade ore in the southwest corner located in the 8 south pushback of the open pit with aggregate recoverable metal approximating 4 billion pounds of copper and 5 million ounces of gold is expected to be mined through pt freeport indonesias large scale block caving operations rather than from openpit mining the revised mine plan reflects a transition from the grasberg open pit to the grasberg underground block cave ore body currently estimated to occur in mid2015 

the mine plan revisions alter the timing of metal production in the period of 2015 and beyond but do not have a significant effect on ultimate recoverable reserves the success of pt freeport indonesias underground operations and the significant progress to establish underground infrastructure provides confidence in developing the highgrade largescale underground ore bodies in the grasberg minerals district pt freeport indonesia will continue to assess opportunities to optimize the longrange mine plans and net present values of the grasberg minerals district 

yearend aggregate proven and probable recoverable reserves net of 2006 production were 28 billion metric tons of ore averaging 104 percent copper 090 gt of gold and 416 gt of silver representing 548 billion pounds of copper 543 million ounces of gold and 1845 million ounces of silver our aggregate exploration budget for 2007 including rio tinto ’s share is expected to total approximately 31 million 25 million for our share pt freeport indonesia’s exploration efforts in 2007 within block a will continue to test extensions of the deep grasberg and kucing liar mine complex engineering studies are under way to incorporate positive drilling results from 2006 activities at deep grasberg and kucing liar pt freeport indonesia also expects to test the openpit potential of the wanagon gold prospect and the ertsberg openpit resource and will begin testing for extensions of the deep mill level zone deposit and other targets in the space between the ertsberg and grasberg mineral systems from the new common infrastructure tunnels see “mining operations  mines in development” located at the 2500 meter level 

 

pursuant to joint venture arrangements between pt freeport indonesia and rio tinto rio tinto has a 40 percent interest in production from reserves above those reported at december 31 1994 net of rio tinto ’s share pt freeport indonesia ’s share of proven and probable recoverable reserves as of december 31 2006 was 388 billion pounds of copper 411 million ounces of gold and 1280 million ounces of silver fcx ’s equity interest in proven and probable recoverable reserves as of december 31 2006 was 352 billion pounds of copper 372 million ounces of gold and 1160 million ounces of silver we estimated recoverable reserves using a copper price of 100 per pound and a gold price of 400 per ounce if metal prices were adjusted to the approximate average london spot prices for the past three years ie copper prices adjusted from 100 per pound to 201 per pound and gold prices adjusted from 400 per ounce to 486 per ounce the resulting additional proven and probable reserves would not be material to our reported reserves 

all of our proven and probable recoverable reserves lie within block a aggregate grasberg open pit and underground proven and probable recoverable ore reserves as of december 31 2006 are shown below along with those of our other deposits reserve calculations were prepared by our employees under the supervision of george d macdonald our vice president of exploration and were reviewed and verified by independent mining consultants inc experts in mining geology and reserve determination see “risk factors” we developed our current mine plan based on completing the mining of all of our currently designated recoverable reserves before the end of 2041 which would be the expiration of our contract of work including the two 10year extensions discussed above prior to the expiration of the initial term of our contract of work in december 2021 under our current mine plan we expect to mine approximately 39 percent of aggregate proven and probable ore representing approximately 45 percent of pt freeport indonesia ’s share of recoverable copper reserves and approximately 59 percent of pt freeport indonesia ’s share of recoverable gold reserves 

 

 

 

 

 

in defining its openpit reserves pt freeport indonesia applies an “economic cutoff grade” strategy the objective of this strategy is to maximize the net present value of its operations pt freeport indonesia uses a breakeven cutoff grade to define the insitu reserves for its underground ore bodies the breakeven cutoff grade is defined for a metric ton of ore as that equivalent copper grade once produced and sold that generates sufficient revenue to cover all operating and administrative costs associated with its production 

our reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies we conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk we revise our mine plans and estimates of proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies 

pt freeport indonesia’s ores contain three commercially recoverable metals copper gold and silver we value all three metals in terms of a copper equivalent percentage to determine a single breakeven cutoff grade copper equivalent percentage is used to express the relative value of multimetal ores in terms of one metal the calculation expresses the relative value of the ore using estimates of contained metal quantities metals prices as used for reserve determination recovery rates treatment charges and royalties the table below shows the breakeven cutoff grade expressed as a copper equivalent percentage for each of our existing ore bodies as of december 31 2006 

 

 

the following table sets forth the average drill hole spacing for each of our ore bodies drill hole spacing data are used by mining professionals such as mining engineers in determining the suitability of data coverage on a relative basis in a given deposit type and mining method scenario so as to achieve a given level of confidence in the resource estimate drill hole spacing is only one of several criteria necessary to establish resource classification drilling programs are typically designed to achieve an optimum sample spacing to support the level of confidence in results that apply to a particular stage of development of a mineral deposit we calculate the average drill hole spacing within each ore body using the distance from the center of each block in the resource model to the nearest drill hole composite we then calculate the averages of these values within the volume of each ore body and reported them under the column entitled “average distance to nearest sample” this value represents at least onehalf of the average drill hole spacing within each deposit we calculate the value under the column entitled “average distance between drill holes” by multiplying the average minimum distance value by two and this value represents the maximum average drill hole spacing 

 

mining operations  mines in production 

we and our predecessors have conducted exploration and mining operations in block a since 1967 and have been the only operator of these operations we currently have two mines in operation the grasberg open pit and the deep ore zone block cave 

grasberg open pit   we began openpit mining of the grasberg ore body in 1990 openpit operations are expected to continue until mid2015 at which time the grasberg underground mining operations are scheduled to begin production is currently at the 3340 to 4285meter elevation level and totaled 637 million metric tons of ore in 

 

 

2006 and 603 million metric tons of ore in 2005 which provided 80 percent of our 2006 mill feed and 81 percent of our 2005 mill feed our openpit mining rate including ore and overburden totaled 677200 metric tons per day in 2006 and 691600 metric tons per day in 2005 approximate annual production rates are expected to range between 650000 metric tons per day and 750000 metric tons per day through 2010 and then decline through 2015 we are studying potential capital outlays for additional haul trucks which would be above the expected maintenance capital costs that will be incurred during the pit’s remaining life 

the current grasberg equipment fleet consists of over 675 units as of december 31 2006 the larger mining equipment directly associated with production includes 168 haul trucks with payloads ranging from approximately 70 metric tons to 330 metric tons 18 shovels with bucket sizes ranging from 29 cubic meters to 42 cubic meters and 65 bulldozers and graders besides the potential purchases of haul trucks discussed above we believe our current equipment level is adequate to meet our projected production levels over the remaining life of the pit 

grasberg crushing and conveying systems are integral to the mine and provide the capacity to transport up to 225000 metric tons per day of grasberg ore to the mill and 135000 metric tons per day of overburden to the overburden stockpiles 

mining costs are charged to operations as incurred however because of the configuration and location of the grasberg openpit ore body and the location and extent of the related surrounding overburden the ratio of overburden to ore is much higher in the initial mining of the open pit than in later years in 2005 and years prior surface mining costs associated with overburden removal at pt freeport indonesia’s grasberg openpit mine that were estimated to relate to future production were initially deferred when the ratio of actual overburden removed to ore mined exceeded the estimated average ratio of overburden removed to ore mined over the life of the grasberg openpit mine as projected in our most recent mine plan those deferred costs were to be charged subsequently to operating costs when the ratio of actual overburden removed to ore mined fell below the estimated average ratio of overburden to ore over the life of the grasberg openpit mine the reserve quantities used to develop the life of mine ratio are the proven and probable ore quantities for the grasberg open pit shown above 

in the mining industry the costs of removing overburden and waste material to access mineral deposits are referred to as “stripping costs” through december 31 2005 we applied the deferred mining cost method in accounting for our postproduction stripping costs the deferred mining cost method was used by some companies in the metals mining industry however industry practice varied the deferred mining cost method matches the cost of production with the sale of the related metal from the open pit by assigning each metric ton of ore removed an equivalent amount of overburden tonnage thereby averaging overburden removal costs over the life of the mine the mining cost capitalized in inventory and the amounts charged to cost of goods sold do not represent the actual costs incurred to mine the ore in any given period the application of the deferred mining cost method resulted in an asset on fcx’s balance sheet “deferred mining costs” totaling 2854 million at december 31 2005 see note 1 

on january 1 2006 we adopted emerging issues task force issue no 046 “accounting for stripping costs incurred during production in the mining industry” eitf 046 which requires that stripping costs incurred during production be considered costs of the extracted minerals and included as a component of inventory to be recognized in cost of sales in the same period as the revenue from the sale of that inventory see note 1 upon adoption of eitf 046 we recorded our deferred mining costs asset 2854 million at december 31 2005 net of taxes minority interest share and inventory effects 1359 million as a cumulative effect adjustment to reduce our retained earnings on january 1 2006 in addition stripping costs incurred in 2006 and later periods are now charged to cost of sales as prescribed by eitf 046 as a result of adopting eitf 046 on january 1 2006 our income before income taxes and minority interests for the year ended december 31 2006 was 354 million lower and net income was 188 million 010 per basic share and 008 per diluted share lower than if we had not adopted eitf 046 and continued to defer stripping costs stripping costs are now charged to cost of sales as prescribed by eitf 046 adoption of the new guidance has no impact on our cash flows the pro forma impact of applying eitf 046 would be to reduce net income by 353 million or 016 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2005 and 394 million or 021 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2004 

deep ore zone the deep ore zone ore body lies vertically below the now depleted intermediate ore zone ore body we began production from the deep ore zone ore body in 1989 using open stope mining methods but we suspended production in 1991 in favor of production from the grasberg deposit production resumed in september 2000 using the blockcave method production is at the 3110meter elevation level and totaled 165 million metric tons of ore in 2006 and 153 million metric tons of ore in 2005 the deep ore zone continues to perform above 

 

 

design capacity of 35000 metric tons of ore per day production from the deep ore zone averaged 45200 metric tons of ore per day in 2006 and 42000 metric tons of ore per day in 2005 

during 2006 at the deep ore zone mine we completed over 12000 meters of development drifting in support of the blockcave mining method and the ongoing expansion to 50000 metric tons of ore per day the expansion to a sustained rate of 50000 metric tons of ore per day is expected to be completed in mid2007 the cumulative aggregate development costs for the deep ore zone expansion through december 31 2006 totaled approximately 56 million approximately 34 million for pt freeport indonesia’s share and the aggregate development costs for 2007 are expected to total approximately 4 million approximately 2 million for pt freeport indonesia’s share we anticipate a further expansion of the deep ore zone operation to 80000 metric tons of ore per day with budgeted capital of approximately 18 million approximately 11 million for pt freeport indonesia’s share in 2007 the success of the development of the deep ore zone mine one of the world’s largest underground mines provides confidence in the future development of pt freeport indonesia’s largescale undeveloped ore bodies 

the deep ore zone mine fleet consists of over 160 pieces of mobile heavy equipment the primary mining equipment directly associated with production and development includes 45 loadhauldump lhd units and 16 haul trucks our production lhd units typically carry approximately 11 metric tons of ore using ore passes and chutes the lhd units transfer ore into 55ton capacity haul trucks the trucks dump into a gyratory crusher and ore is then conveyed to the surface stockpiles 

our development costs include costs incurred resulting from mine preproduction activities undertaken to gain access to proven and probable reserves including adits drifts ramps permanent excavations infrastructure and removal of overburden depreciation for mining and milling lifeofmine assets is determined using the unitofproduction method based on estimated recoverable proven and probable copper reserves development costs that relate to a specific ore body are depreciated using the unitofproduction method based on estimated recoverable proven and probable copper reserves for the ore body benefited pt freeport indonesia’s total development costs at december 31 2006 for the deep ore zone mine currently our only operating underground mine totaled approximately 224 million which are being depreciated on a unitofproduction basis over the life of the deep ore zone proven and probable reserves see note 1 

the majority of maintenance activities are performed on site by a combination of pt freeport indonesia employees and contract workers as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 7000 employees and contract workers directly involved in grasberg openpit and deep ore zone underground mining milling and ore flow operations 

our principal source of power for all our operations is a coalfired power plant that we built in conjunction with our fourth concentrator mill expansion see “infrastructure” diesel generators supply peaking and backup electrical power generating capacity a combination of naturally occurring mountain streams and water derived from our underground operations provides water for our operations the average annual rainfall in the project area is 185 inches 

mining operations  mines in development 

seven other ore bodies the underground grasberg kucing liar mill level zone deep mill level zone ertsberg stockwork zone big gossan and the dom are located in block a these ore bodies are at various stages of development and are included in our proven and probable recoverable reserves we continually review our operation’s development opportunities to maximize the value of the reserves we incurred 614 million for mine development expansion and infrastructure capital expenditures related to these ore bodies and 495 million for common underground infrastructure development during the three years ended december 31 2006 see “risk factors” 

the underground grasberg reserves will be mined using the blockcave method at the end of openpit mining which is expected to continue until approximately mid2015 the kucing liar ore body lies on the southern flank of and underneath the southern portion of the grasberg open pit at the 2605 to 3115meter elevation level we expect to mine the kucing liar ore body using the blockcave method 

the mill level zone ore body lies directly below the deep ore zone mine at the 2890meter elevation the deep mill level zone ore body lies beneath the mill level zone ore body at the 2590meter elevation this ore represents the downward continuation of mineralization in the ertsberg east skarn system and neighboring ertsberg porphyry drilling efforts continue to determine the extent of these ore bodies we expect to mine the mill level 

 

 

zone ore body using a blockcave method near completion of mining at the deep ore zone ore body near the end of mining the mill level zone ore body we expect to mine the deep mill level zone ore body also using a blockcave method 

the ertsberg stockwork zone ore body extends off the southwest side of the deep ore zone ore body at the 3126 to 3626meter elevation level drilling efforts continue to determine the extent of this ore body which we expect to mine using a blockcave method starting in about 2008 

the big gossan ore body is located approximately 1000 meters southwest of the original ertsberg openpit deposit we began the initial underground development of the ore body in 1993 when we drove tunnels from the mill area into the ore zone at the 3000meter elevation level a stope and fill mining method will be used on the big gossan deposit in 2005 we completed a feasibility study and an update to the sitewide development plan to determine the timing of initial production currently projected to be 2008 

the dom ore body lies approximately 1500 meters southeast of the depleted ertsberg openpit deposit production at the openpit and underground portions of the ore body will begin after completion of openpit mining at grasberg 

in 2004 pt freeport indonesia commenced its “common infrastructure” project which will provide access to its large undeveloped underground ore bodies located in the grasberg minerals district through a tunnel system located approximately 400 meters deeper than its existing underground tunnel system in addition to providing access to our underground ore bodies the tunnel system will enable pt freeport indonesia to conduct future exploration in prospective areas associated with currently identified ore bodies the tunnel system has reached the big gossan terminal and pt freeport indonesia is proceeding with development of the lower big gossan infrastructure pt freeport indonesia has also advanced development of the grasberg spur and as of december 31 2006 has completed 67 percent of the tunneling required to reach the grasberg underground ore body pt freeport indonesia expects the grasberg spur to reach the grasberg underground ore body and to initiate multiyear mine development activities in the second half of 2007 

the projected aggregate capital expenditures required to reach full production capacity for each of our undeveloped ore bodies based on our latest mine plans and our proven and probable recoverable reserves as of december 31 2006 are shown below in millions of us dollars actual costs could differ materially from these estimates as we will not incur most of the expenditures for several years and we will incur them over a period of several years in addition to the mine development costs below our current mine development plans include approximately 1 billion of capital expenditures at our processing facilities to optimize the handling of underground ore types once grasberg openpit operations cease we continue to review our processing plans to maximize the value of our reserves based on our current estimates we expect aggregate expenditures will range between approximately 100 million and 320 million annually during the next 15 years in addition these costs will be shared with rio tinto in accordance with our joint venture agreement 

 

 

description of ore bodies our ore bodies are located within and around two main igneous intrusions the grasberg monzodiorite and the ertsberg diorite the host rocks of these ore bodies include both carbonate and clastic rocks that form the ridge crests and upper flanks of the sudirman range and the igneous rocks of monzonitic to dioritic composition that intrude them the igneoushosted ore bodies the grasberg open pit and block cave and the ertsberg stockwork zone block cave occur as vein stockworks and disseminations of copper sulphides dominated by chalcopyrite and to a much lesser extent bornite the sedimentaryrock hosted ore bodies occur as “magnetiterich calciummagnesian skarn” replacements whose location and orientation are strongly influenced by major faults and by the chemistry of the carbonate rocks along the margins of the intrusions 

the copper mineralization in these skarn deposits is also dominated by chalcopyrite but higher bornite concentrations are common moreover gold occurs in significant concentrations in all of the district ’s ore bodies though rarely visible to the naked eye these gold concentrations usually occur as inclusions within the copper sulphide minerals though in some deposits these concentrations can also be strongly associated with pyrite 

 

the following diagram indicates the relative elevations in meters of our reported reserve ore bodies 

 

 

 

the following map which encompasses an area of approximately 42 square kilometers approximately 16 square miles indicates the relative positions and sizes of our reported reserve ore bodies and their locations 

 

 

the following chart illustrates our current plans for sequencing and producing each of our ore bodies and the years in which we currently expect that production of each ore body will begin and end production volumes are typically lower in the first few years of each ore body as development activities are ongoing and as the mine ramps up to full production currently the grasberg open pit and deep ore zone are our only producing mines the ultimate timing of the start of production from our undeveloped mines is dependent upon a number of factors including the results of our exploration and development efforts and may vary from the dates shown below in addition we develop our mine plans for the grasberg open pit and underground mines based on maximizing the net present value from the ore bodies 

 

 

during 2006 we mined an average of 722400 metric tons of material per day including ore and overburden we do not require any additional approvals for higher mining rates during 2005 we mined an average of 733600 metric tons of material per day the following chart illustrates our current aggregate mill capacity our aggregate permitted mill capacity and our projected milling rates mill capacity will vary with the ore type being processed the decline in milling rates in 2015 reflects the expected completion date of openpit mining at the grasberg ore body we are continuing to develop mine plans to optimize production levels 

 

milling and production 

the ore from our mines moves by a conveyor system to a series of shafts through which it drops to our milling and concentrating complex located approximately 2900 meters above sea level at the mill the ore is crushed and ground and mixed in tanks with water and small amounts of flotation reagents where it is continuously agitated with air during this physical separation process copper gold and silverbearing particles rise to the top of the tanks and are collected and thickened into a concentrate the concentrate leaves the mill complex as a slurry consisting of approximately 65 percent solids by weight and is pumped through three parallel 115kilometer pipelines to our coastal port site facility at amamapare where it is filtered dried and stored for shipping ships are loaded at dock facilities at the port until they draw their maximum dockside water and they then move to deeper water where loading is completed from shuttling barges 

our production results for the last three years are as follows 

 



 

 

although average mill throughput increased by six percent to 229400 metric tons of ore per day from 216200 metric tons per day in 2005 we mined lower grade ore and reported lower production in 2006 compared with 2005 copper production for 2006 totaled 12 billion pounds 2547 million pounds lower than 2005 production gold production for 2006 totaled 17 million ounces 11 million ounces lower than 2005 production average unit net cash costs for 2006 increased to 060 per pound from 007 per pound for 2005 as a result of higher unit production costs resulting from lower volumes higher input costs and the impact of changes in accounting for stripping costs and higher treatment charges and royalties attributable to increased copper prices 

mill throughput and production improved significantly in 2005 compared to 2004 which was negatively affected by pt freeport indonesia ’s efforts to accelerate removal of overburden material and restore safe access to highergrade areas in the pit see below mill throughput averaged 216200 metric tons of ore per day in 2005 a 17 percent increase from the 185100 metric tons average in 2004 copper and gold production was higher in 2005 compared with 2004 reflecting the higher mill throughput and higher average ore grades copper production for 2005 totaled 146 billion pounds 4594 million pounds higher than 2004 production gold production for 2005 totaled 279 million ounces 13 million ounces higher than 2004 production the higher sales volumes and the primarily fixed nature of a large portion of pt freeport indonesia ’s cost structure resulted in average unit net cash costs for 2005 decreasing to 007 per pound compared with 040 per pound for 2004 

in october 2003 a slippage of material occurred in a section of the grasberg open pit and in december 2003 a smaller debris flow occurred in the same section the area affected by the slippage events included two active mining areas which were scheduled to be mined in the fourth quarter of 2003 see “grasberg openpit slippage” mill throughput and production in 2004 was negatively affected by pt freeport indonesia ’s efforts to accelerate removal of overburden material and restore safe access to highergrade areas in the pit 

because of the fixed nature of a large portion of our costs unit costs vary significantly from period to period depending on volumes of copper and gold sold during the period in addition we have experienced significant increases in our production costs in recent years primarily as a result of higher energy costs and costs of other consumables higher mining costs and milling rates labor costs and other factors once we complete our openpit mining operations at the grasberg mine in approximately mid2015 and transition to underground we expect our share of annual copper and gold production to be lower than current levels and all other factors being equal our average unit net cash costs to increase for more information regarding our operating and financial results see our 2006 annual report incorporated herein by reference 

we estimate our share of sales for 2007 to approximate 11 billion pounds of copper and 18 million ounces of gold average annual sales volumes over the fiveyear period from 2007 through 2011 are expected to approximate 124 billion pounds of copper and 18 million ounces of gold the achievement of pt freeport indonesia’s sales estimates will be dependent among other factors on the achievement of targeted mining rates the successful operation of pt freeport indonesia production facilities the impact of weather conditions at the end of fiscal periods on concentrate loading activities and other factors see “risk factors” 

geotechnical programs 

our geotechnical programs support several phases of the operations including our openpit mine pit slope and overburden stockpile stability our underground mine our infrastructure and our tailings management program for information regarding our tailings management program see “environmental matters” 

a group of our senior level employees has the responsibility authority and oversight for our overall geotechnical programs our multidisciplinary approach combines inhouse personnel with backgrounds in civil geotechnical mining engineering geology and hydrology to form a technical services group that reports to our senior managers our technical services group develops information that our mine engineering group uses to develop mine and stockpile designs production schedules and related plans our technical services group also monitors slope stability and other geotechnical and hydrological developments 

our technical services group is composed of expatriates and indonesian nationals who are university educated international consulting experts in each of the applicable technical fields also provide additional support to this group inhouse training provided by consultants as well as offsite seminars and industry conferences supports the training of our staff our joint venture partner has also provided geotechnical and engineering support to our operations consultants and our joint venture partner provide input into program development and assess performance of these critical roles 

 

our technical services group uses information from geological drilling for the development and updating of our geological geotechnical and hydrologic models we develop computerbased geologic models for mine design and dewatering programs we provide continuous ground and slope monitoring in our mines and on overburden stockpiles using various computerized and automated systems we also daily inspect all openpit working areas with any items of concern being reported to our senior managers our hydrology function measures and tracks water flow patterns to determine the effectiveness and need for dewatering and depressurization programs we drain all surface flows away from the open pit and pump any inpit surface water to dedicated drain holes connected to our underground dewatering drift system we also continuously monitor rainfall at our operations so that we may adjust for operational impacts and safety considerations 

grasberg openpit slippage 

on october 9 2003 a slippage of material occurred in a section of the grasberg open pit eight workers perished and five workers were injured in the incident the area affected by the slippage comprising approximately five percent of the surface area of the massive grasberg pit included two active mining areas that were scheduled to be mined in 2003 and 2004 on december 12 2003 a debris flow involving a relatively small amount of loose material occurred in the same area of the grasberg open pit resulting in only minor property damage following these two events pt freeport indonesia redirected its openpit operations to accelerate removal of waste material from the south wall to restore safe access to the highergrade ore areas in the pit these activities resulted in reduced production levels in april 2004 pt freeport indonesia established safe access and initiated mining in highergrade ore areas while continuing waste removal activities pt freeport indonesia resumed normal milling rates in june 2004 

pt freeport indonesia maintains property damage and business interruption insurance related to its operations in december 2004 we entered into an insurance settlement agreement and settled all claims that arose from the fourthquarter 2003 slippage and debris flow events in the grasberg openpit mine pt freeport indonesia ’s insurers agreed to pay an aggregate of 1250 million in connection with its claims after considering our joint venture partner ’s interest in the proceeds pt freeport indonesia ’s share of proceeds totaled 950 million 

exploration 

as a result of our joint venture arrangements rio tinto generally pays for 40 percent of our joint venture exploration and exploratory drilling costs in papua the joint ventures incurred total exploration costs of 167 million in 2006 and 133 million in 2005 the joint ventures’ exploration budget for 2007 including rio tinto’s share is expected to total approximately 31 million 25 million for our share pt freeport indonesia’s exploration efforts in 2007 within block a will continue to test extensions of the deep grasberg and kucing liar mine complex engineering studies are under way to incorporate positive drilling results from 2006 activities at deep grasberg and kucing liar pt freeport indonesia also expects to test the openpit potential of the wanagon gold prospect and the ertsberg openpit resource and will begin testing for extensions of the deep mill level zone deposit and other targets in the space between the ertsberg and grasberg mineral systems from the new common infrastructure tunnels located at the 2500 meter level during 2007 we plan to resume exploration activities which had been suspended in recent years in certain prospective areas outside block a 

in june 1998 we entered into a joint venture agreement to conduct exploration activities in pt nabire bakti mining ’s contract of work area which currently covers approximately 500000 acres in several blocks contiguous to pt freeport indonesia ’s block b and one of eastern minerals’ blocks in papua rio tinto shares in 40 percent of our interest and costs in this exploration joint venture we and rio tinto can earn up to a 62 percent interest in the pt nabire bakti mining contract of work by spending up to 21 million on exploration and other activities in the joint venture areas we have spent 180 million through december 31 2006 

with the subsequent approval of the indonesian government in 2000 we suspended our field exploration activities in block b which includes the wabu ridge gold prospect as well as in the other contract of work areas of eastern minerals and pt nabire bakti mining the suspensions were because of safety and security issues and regulatory uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest areas and an indonesian forestry law enacted in 1999 prohibiting openpit mining in forest preservation areas recent indonesian legislation permits openpit mining in pt freeport indonesia’s block b area subject to certain requirements following an assessment of these requirements and a review of security issues we plan to resume exploration activities in certain prospective contract of work areas outside of block a in 2007 

 

infrastructure 

the location of our mining operations in a remote area requires that our operations be virtually selfsufficient in addition to the mining facilities described above in the course of the development of our project we have constructed ourselves or participated with others in the construction of an airport a port a 119 kilometer road an aerial tramway two hospitals and related medical facilities and two town sites with housing schools and other facilities sufficient to support more than 17000 persons 

in 1996 we completed a significant infrastructure program which includes various residential community and commercial facilities we designed the program to provide the infrastructure needed for our operations to enhance the living conditions of our employees and to develop and promote the growth of local and other third party activities and enterprises in papua we have developed the facilities through joint ventures or direct ownership involving local indonesian interests and other investors 

in july 2003 we acquired the 857 percent ownership interest in puncakjaya power owned by affiliates of duke energy corporation for 681 million cash net of 99 million of cash acquired puncakjaya power is the owner of assets supplying power to pt freeport indonesia’s operations including the 3x65 megawatt coalfired power facilities pt freeport indonesia purchases power from puncakjaya power under infrastructure asset financing arrangements in march 2005 we prepaid 1870 million of bank debt associated with puncakjaya power’s operations at december 31 2006 we had a 1052 million loan outstanding to puncakjaya power pt freeport indonesia had infrastructure asset financing obligations payable to puncakjaya power totaling 1924 million and puncakjaya power had a receivable from pt freeport indonesia for 2473 million including rio tinto’s share we consolidate pt freeport indonesia and puncakjaya power and our consolidated balance sheet only reflects a 546 million receivable 86 million in other accounts receivable and 460 million in longterm assets for rio tinto’s share of puncakjaya power’s receivable as provided for in our joint venture agreement with rio tinto 

marketing 

pt freeport indonesia sells its copper concentrates which contain significant quantities of gold and silver under us dollardenominated sales agreements mostly to companies in asia and europe and to international trading companies we sell substantially all of our budgeted production of copper concentrates under longterm contracts with selling prices based on world metals prices generally the london metal exchange settlement prices for grade a copper under these contracts initial billing occurs at the time of shipment and final settlement on the copper portion is generally based on average prices for a specified future period gold generally is sold at the average london bullion market association price for a specified month near the month of shipment 

revenues from concentrate sales are recorded net of royalties see “contracts of work” treatment and refining charges including price participation charges if applicable based on the market prices of metals and the impact of derivative financial instruments if any used to hedge against risks from metals price fluctuations moreover because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrates is unrecoverable as a result of the smelting process our revenues from concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances based on the quantity and value of these unrecoverable metals these allowances are a negotiated term of our contracts and vary by customer treatment and refining charges represent payments to smelters and refiners and are either fixed or in certain cases vary with the price of copper we sell a small amount of copper concentrates in the spot market see “risk factors” 

we have commitments including commitments from atlantic copper and pt smelting for essentially all of pt freeport indonesia’s estimated 2007 production pt freeport indonesia has a longterm contract through december 2007 to provide atlantic copper with a quantity of copper concentrates at market prices which currently approximates 60 percent of atlantic copper ’s annual copper concentrate requirements pt freeport indonesia ’s agreement with pt smelting provides for the life of pt freeport indonesia ’s mines for the supply of 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements necessary to produce 205000 metric tons of copper essentially the gresik smelter ’s original design capacity on a priority basis in 2004 pt smelting increased its stated production capacity to 250000 metric tons of copper per year during 2006 pt smelting completed an expansion of its production capacity from 250000 metric tons of copper per year to 275000 metric tons for the first 15 years of pt smelting ’s commercial operations beginning december 1998 pt freeport indonesia agreed that the treatment and refining charges on specified quantities of the concentrate pt freeport indonesia supplies will not fall below specified minimum rates subject to renegotiation in 2008 the rate was 023 per pound during the period from the commencement of pt smelting ’s operations in 1998 until april 3 2004 when it declined to a minimum of 021 per 

 

 

pound pt smelting’s rates for 2007 are expected to exceed the minimum 021 per pound current rates are higher than the minimum rate we anticipate that pt freeport indonesia will sell approximately 50 to 60 percent of its annual concentrate production to atlantic copper and pt smelting a summary of pt freeport indonesia ’s aggregate percentage concentrate sales to its affiliates and to other parties for the last three years follows 

 

investment in smelters 

our investment in smelters atlantic copper and pt smelting serves an important role in our concentrate marketing strategy as discussed above pt freeport indonesia generally sells approximately onehalf of its concentrate production to its affiliated smelters atlantic copper and pt smelting and the remainder to other customers treatment charges for smelting and refining copper concentrates represent a cost to pt freeport indonesia and income to atlantic copper and pt smelting through downstream integration we are assured placement of a significant portion of our concentrate production low smelter treatment and refining charges prior to 2005 adversely affected the operating results of atlantic copper and benefited the operating results of pt freeport indonesia ’s mining operations smelting and refining charges consist of a base rate and in certain contracts price participation and price sharing based on copper prices market rates for treatment and refining charges have increased significantly since late 2004 as worldwide smelter availability was insufficient to accommodate increased mine production and because of higher copper prices however more recently we have begun to see these market rates decline higher treatment and refining charges benefit our smelter operations and adversely affect our mining operations taking into account taxes and minority ownership interests an equivalent change in pt freeport indonesia’s and atlantic copper’s smelting and refining charge rates essentially offsets in our consolidated operating results 

atlantic copper sa we own 100 percent of atlantic copper atlantic copper completed the last expansion of its production capacity in 1997 and the design capacity of its smelter and its refinery are 290000 metric tons of copper per year and its refinery currently has a nominal capacity of 260000 metric tons of copper per year respectively we have no present plans to expand atlantic copper ’s production capacity during 2006 atlantic copper treated 953700 metric tons of concentrate and scrap and produced 263700 metric tons of new copper anodes during 2005 atlantic copper treated 975400 metric tons of concentrate and scrap and produced 284200 metric tons of new copper anodes atlantic copper’s positive financial results in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily reflect higher treatment charges partially offset by higher unit costs the next maintenance activity at atlantic copper is a 23day maintenance turnaround currently scheduled for the second quarter of 2007 which is expected to adversely affect costs and volumes resulting in an approximate 25 million impact on 2007 operating results major maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately every nine years for atlantic copper with significantly shorter term maintenance turnarounds occurring in the interim atlantic copper purchased approximately 42 percent of its 2006 concentrate requirements from pt freeport indonesia at market prices atlantic copper has experienced no material operating problems and we are not aware of any potential material environmental liabilities at atlantic copper 

we made no capital contributions to atlantic copper in 2005 and 2006 however we contributed 2020 million to atlantic copper in 2004 in addition we loaned 1895 million to atlantic copper in 2004 the funds were used to improve atlantic copper ’s financial structure during its major maintenance turnaround and during a period of extremely low treatment and refining charge rates which negatively affected atlantic copper ’s results our net investment in atlantic copper through december 31 2006 was approximately 170 million 

pt smelting pt freeport indonesia ’s contract of work required us to construct or cause to be constructed a smelter in indonesia if we and the indonesian government determined that such a project would be economically viable in 1995 following the completion of a feasibility study we entered into agreements relating to the formation of pt smelting and the construction of the copper smelter in gresik indonesia 

pt smelting is a joint venture among pt freeport indonesia mitsubishi materials corporation mitsubishi corporation and nippon mining  metals co ltd which own 25 percent 605 percent 95 percent and 5 percent respectively of the outstanding pt smelting common stock in accordance with the joint venture agreements pt 

 

 

freeport indonesia provides the majority of pt smelting ’s copper concentrate requirements in december 2003 pt smelting ’s shareholder agreement was amended to eliminate pt freeport indonesia ’s assignment of its earnings in pt smelting to support a 13 percent cumulative annual return to the other owners for the first 20 years of operations no amounts were paid under this assignment pt freeport indonesia ’s total investment in pt smelting through december 31 2006 was 1006 million 

during 2006 pt smelting treated 737500 metric tons of concentrate and produced 201200 metric tons of new copper anodes during 2005 pt smelting treated 908900 metric tons of concentrate and produced 275000 metric tons of new copper anodes the lower volumes in 2006 primarily reflect a 22day maintenance turnaround in the second quarter and pt smelting’s temporary suspension of operations beginning in october 2006 and ending in middecember 2006 following an equipment failure at the oxygen plant supplying the smelter major maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately every four years for pt smelting with significantly shorter term maintenance turnarounds in the interim the next major maintenance turnaround is scheduled for 2008 in 2004 pt smelting completed a refinery expansion during its maintenance turnaround increasing its production capacity to approximately 250000 metric tons of copper per year during 2006 pt smelting completed an expansion of its production capacity from 250000 metric tons of copper per year to 275000 metric tons we are not aware of any potential material environmental liabilities at pt smelting 

competition 

we compete with other mining companies in the sale of our mineral concentrates and the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel some competing companies possess financial resources greater than ours and possess multiple mining assets less geographically concentrated in a single area than ours we believe however that we are one of the lowest cost copper producers in the world after taking into account credits for related gold and silver production which gives us a significant competitive advantage 

social development employment and human rights 

we have a social employment and human rights policy designed to result in our operating in compliance with the laws in the areas of our operations and in a manner that respects basic human rights and the culture of the people who are indigenous to the area we continue to make significant expenditures on social and cultural activities primarily in papua these activities include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in 1996 pt freeport indonesia agreed to commit at least one percent of its revenues to the freeport partnership fund for community development formerly the freeport fund for irian jaya development to support villagebased health education economic and social development programs in its area of operations this commitment replaced our community development programs in which we spent a similar amount of money each year our share of contributions to the freeport partnership fund for community development totaled 439 million in 2006 357 million in 2005 and 175 million in 2004 our joint venture partner rio tinto also contributes to this fund and including their share the contributions totaled 476 million in 2006 423 million in 2005 and 190 million in 2004 

lembaga pembangunan masyarakat amungme kamoro lpmak oversees disbursement of the amounts we contribute to the fund lpmak ’s board of commissioners is made up of a leader of the amungme people a leader of the kamoro people leaders of the three local churches a representative of the local government and a representative of pt freeport indonesia the amungme and kamoro people are original inhabitants of the land in our area of operations 

we believe that our social and economic development programs are responsive to the issues raised by the local villages and people and should help us to avoid disruptions of mining operations nevertheless social and political instability in the area may adversely impact our mining operations see “risk factors” 

 

in december 2000 we endorsed the joint us state departmentbritish foreign office voluntary principles on human rights and security several major natural resources companies and international human rights organizations participated in developing the voluntary principles and have endorsed them we participated in developing these principles and incorporated them into our social and human rights policy 

security matters 

consistent with our contract of work and the requirement to protect our employees and property we have taken appropriate steps to provide a safe and secure working environment as part of its security program pt freeport indonesia maintains its own internal security department which performs functions such as protecting company facilities monitoring the shipment of company goods through the airport and terminal assisting in traffic control and aiding rescue operations pt freeport indonesia ’s civilian security employees numbering about 675 are unarmed and perform duties consistent with their internal security role pt freeport indonesia ’s share of costs for its internal civilian security department totaled 142 million for 2006 113 million for 2005 and 123 million for 2004 the security department has received human rights training and each member is required to certify his or her compliance with our human rights policy 

pt freeport indonesia and all businesses and residents of indonesia relies on the government of indonesia for the provision of public order upholding the rule of law and the protection of personnel and property the grasberg mine has been designated by the government of indonesia as one of indonesia ’s vital national assets this designation results in the military ’s playing a significant role in protecting the area of our operations the government of indonesia is responsible for employing police and military personnel and directing their operations 

from the outset of pt freeport indonesia ’s operations the government has looked to pt freeport indonesia to provide logistical and infrastructure support and assistance for these necessary services because of the limited resources of the indonesian government and the remote location of and lack of development in papua pt freeport indonesia ’s financial support for the indonesian government security institutions assigned to the operations area represents a prudent response to its requirements to protect its workforce and property better ensuring that personnel are properly fed and lodged and have the logistical resources to patrol pt freeport indonesia ’s roads and secure its operating area in addition provision of such support and oversight is consistent with pt freeport indonesia ’s obligations under the contract of work reflects our philosophy of responsible corporate citizenship and is in keeping with our commitment to pursue practices that will promote human rights which include our endorsement of the joint us state departmentbritish foreign office voluntary principles on human rights and security 

pt freeport indonesia ’s share of support costs for the governmentprovided security involving over 2625 indonesian government security personnel currently located in the general area of our operations was 85 million for 2006 62 million for 2005 and 69 million for 2004 this supplemental support consists of various infrastructure and other costs such as food housing fuel travel vehicle repairs allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs and community assistance programs conducted by the militarypolice pt freeport indonesia ’s capital costs for associated infrastructure was 01 million for 2006 01 million for 2005 and 02 million for 2004 

as reported in january 2006 we are responding to requests from governmental authorities in united states and indonesia for information about pt freeport indonesia primarily relating to pt freeport indonesia’s support of indonesian security institutions as discussed above we provide support to assist security institutions deployed and directed by the government of indonesia with infrastructure logistics and the hardship elements of posting in papua and our practices adhere to the joint us state departmentbritish foreign office voluntary principles on security and human rights we are cooperating with these requests 

environmental matters 

we have a boardapproved environmental policy that commits us not only to compliance with applicable federal state and local environmental statutes and regulations but also to continuous improvement of our environmental performance at every operational site we believe that we conduct our indonesian operations pursuant to all necessary permits and are in compliance in all material respects with applicable indonesian environmental laws rules and regulations additionally the environmental management systems for our pt freeport indonesia mining and milling operations and our atlantic copper smelting operations are iso international standardization organization 14001 certified 

 

mining operations on the scale of our operations in papua involve significant environmental challenges primarily related to the disposition of tailings which are the crushed and ground rock material resulting from the physical separation of commercially valuable minerals from the ore we have comprehensive ongoing environmental management and monitoring plans for the disposal of tailings resulting from our milling operations which the government of indonesia has approved pursuant to these plans we manage and monitor the impact of our tailings disposal on the surrounding area of the ajkwa river and adjoining water bodies and the surrounding coastal areas in 1997 we completed an engineered levee system to minimize the impact of the tailings through a controlled deposition area located on a portion of the flood plain on the ajkwa river 

in furtherance of our commitments to the indonesian government pursuant to our tailings management plan we monitor the acidneutralizing capacity of tailings on a daily basis to ensure the discharge of nonacid generating tailings into our tailings deposition area the net acidneutralizing capacity of our tailings discharge is maintained through a managed program of blending underground ore with ore from the open pit the addition of supplemental limestone or lime to the ore blend and the addition of lime for control of the ph levels in the flotation system daily samples are collected and tested and this data is communicated to our mill operations so that appropriate adjustments in ore blending and limelimestone addition can be made 

with respect to overburden control and treatment of acid rock drainage is our primary environmental issue our approaches to this issue include the prevention of acid rock drainage generation the control of acid rock drainage migration and the capture and treatment of acid rock drainage emanating from the overburden stockpile in addition tests have shown the feasibility of revegetating the overburden stockpile and as a result we have engaged in stockpile reclamation as an additional means of mitigating acid rock drainage 

we have made significant capital expenditures with respect to the capture and treatment of acid rock drainage we continue to evaluate various technologies for the treatment of captured acid rock drainage currently acid rock drainage collected by boreholes at the base of the overburden stockpile is treated using conventional lime neutralization 

we have also committed to the indonesian government to have independent external environmental audits of our papuan operations performed by qualified experts every three years with results available for public review we have had four independent environmental audits conducted by internationally recognized consulting and auditing firms audits were completed in 1996 by dames  moore in 1999 by montgomery watson in 2002 by sgs international certification services indonesia a member of the société générale de surveillance group and in 2005 by montgomery watson harza montgomery watson harza concluded that pt freeport indonesia’s mining operations “are among the largest and most environmentally challenging and complex in the world” and that the company’s “environmental management practices continue to be based on and in some cases represent best management practices for the international copper and gold mining industry” the audit also concluded as have previous independent audits that pt freeport indonesia’s tailings management program “remains the tailings management option best suited to the unique topographical and climatological conditions of the site with a far lower level of environmental impact and risk” than those posed by alternatives the montgomery watson harza auditors also made a number of specific recommendations for improvements in pt freeport indonesia’s environmental management practices and these are being implemented we also conduct annual internal audits to ensure that our environmental management and monitoring programs remain sound and our operations will continue to comply in all material respects with applicable regulations 

in addition to these audits pt freeport indonesia agreed to participate in the government of indonesia’s proper program in 2005 in march 2006 the indonesian ministry of environment announced the preliminary results of its proper environmental management audit acknowledging the effectiveness of pt freeport indonesia’s environmental management practices in some areas while making several suggestions for improvement in others we are working with the ministry of environment to address the issues raised as we complete the audit process 

in connection with obtaining our environmental approvals from the indonesian government we committed to performing a onetime environmental risk assessment on the impacts of our tailings management plan we completed this extensive environmental risk assessment with more than 90 scientific studies conducted over four years and submitted it to the indonesian government in december 2002 we developed the risk assessment exercise with input from an independent review panel which included representatives from the indonesian government academia and nongovernmental organizations the risks that we identified during this process were in line with our impact projections of the tailings management program contained in our environmental approval documents 

 

we have environmental approvals from the government of indonesia to expand our milling rate up to a maximum of 300000 metric tons of ore per day in 2006 we averaged 229400 metric tons of ore per day and in 2005 we averaged 216200 metric tons of ore per day 

the cost of complying with environmental laws is a fundamental cost of our business we incurred aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs totaling 627 million in 2006 440 million in 2005 and 651 million in 2004 including tailings management levee maintenance and mine reclamation in 2007 we expect to incur approximately 43 million of aggregate environmental capital expenditures and 55 million of other environmental costs 

we are currently revegetating portions of the tailings deposition area upon the completion of our mining operations we will fulfill the commitments included in our approved environmental management plans our plans for revegetation of affected areas of the deposition area include natural revegetation forage crops and grasses fruits grains and vegetables and other traditional food and medicinal crops decisions on these plans are made in consultation with local and regional government local residents and other stakeholders in addition to the revegetation and reclamation of the deposition area we will continue to operate treatment systems as long as necessary we also monitor and test the water discharged from our mine and the ph sulfate and electrical conductivity levels of ground water in the deposition area the stability of our levees will be ensured through comprehensive visual inspection maintenance and improvement programs directed by an experienced engineering group dedicated to levee management and revegetation of the levee embankments moreover we will submit an annual written report to the indonesian government regarding our reclamation activities 

our ultimate reclamation and closure activities will be determined after consultation with the indonesian government local residents and other parties our estimate as of december 31 2006 of pt freeport indonesia ’s total aggregate reclamation and closure obligations total approximately 157 million estimates of reclamation and closure costs involve complex issues requiring integrated assessments over a period of many years and we may revise them as we perform more complete studies some reclamation costs will be incurred during mining activities while most closure costs and the remaining reclamation costs will be incurred at the end of mining activities which are currently estimated to continue for more than 34 years 

moreover we cannot predict with any certainty the ultimate future uses of the tailings deposition area once our mining operations are completed in addition to forage crop and grass planting and food and medicinal crop production possible future uses of the tailings deposition area include rainforest regrowth production of timber fuel woods fruits and nuts and other economic forestry and the cultivation of fish shellfish and other aquaculture the ultimate future uses will be determined in consultation with local and regional government local residents and other stakeholders 

in 1996 we began contributing to a cash fund 85 million balance at december 31 2006 designed to accumulate at least 100 million by the end of our indonesian mining activities we plan to use this fund including accrued interest to pay for mine closure and reclamation costs any incremental costs in excess of this 100 million fund are expected to be incurred throughout the life of the mine and would be funded by operational cash flow or other sources future environmental considerations and future changes in regulations could require us to incur additional costs that would be charged against future operations estimates involving environmental matters are by their nature imprecise and changes in government regulations operations technology and inflation can be expected to require us to revise them over time 

we believe that atlantic copper ’s facilities and operations are in compliance in all material respects with all currently applicable spanish environmental laws rules and regulations in july 2002 the integrated pollution prevention and control guidelines were adopted under spanish law with a phase in for compliance by 2009 atlantic copper working with local environmental authorities is continually assessing the impact of these new guidelines on its operations and has budgeted approximately 27 million as its estimate of the remaining required capital expenditures from 2007 through 2010 to comply in april 2006 the environmental management systems at atlantic copper’s operations in huelva were audited by the spanish association for standardization and certification aenor in accordance with the iso 1400196 international certification standards and the european union environmental ecomanagement and ecoauditing emas regulation no 7612001 aenor is a spanish notforprofit entity that has been accredited by the spanish government to inspect audit and certify environmental management systems atlantic copper received positive results from the audits which are required annually to retain the iso 14001 certification that atlantic copper achieved in prior years 

 

the indonesian and spanish governments may periodically revise their environmental laws and regulations or adopt new ones and we cannot predict the effects on our operations of new or revised regulations we have expended significant resources both financial and managerial to comply with environmental regulations and permitting and approval requirements and we anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future there can be no assurance that we will not incur additional significant costs and liabilities to comply with such current and future regulations or that such regulations will not materially affect our operations see “risk factors” 

employees and relationship with fm services company 

as of december 31 2006 pt freeport indonesia had 8957 employees approximately 98 percent indonesian and 6141 contract workers the vast majority of whom were indonesian approximately 74 percent of pt freeport indonesia ’s employees are represented by the all indonesia workers’ union which operates under government of indonesia supervision pt freeport indonesia has a labor agreement covering its hourly paid indonesian employees the key provisions of which are renegotiated biannually in june 2005 pt freeport indonesia and its workers agreed to terms for a new labor agreement that expires in september 2007 pt freeport indonesia’s relations with the workers’ union have generally been satisfactory in addition 4579 persons worked for privatized companies providing services within pt freeport indonesia ’s operations area 

as of december 31 2006 atlantic copper had 550 employees of which approximately 74 percent are represented by union contracts atlantic copper’s labor contract covering its smelterrefinery workforce in huelva spain expired on december 31 2005 and was renewed for a threeyear period with no material changes in terms atlantic copper experienced a fourday labor strike in october 2004 at its smelter facility in huelva because of a workforce reduction plan the union’s issues with the workforce reduction plan were resolved and the plan was approved by spanish authorities and implemented in december 2004 

fm services company fm services furnishes executive administrative financial accounting legal tax and similar services to us fm services became our wholly owned subsidiary in october 2002 when we purchased the remaining 50 percent ownership in fm services from mcmoran exploration co mcmoran for 13 million as of december 31 2006 fcx had 9 employees and fm services had 145 employees fm services employees continue to also provide services to mcmoran a publicly traded company engaged in the exploration development and production of oil and gas and stratus properties inc a publicly traded company engaged in the development of real estate

because our primary operating assets are located in the republic of indonesia our business may be adversely affected by indonesian political economic and social uncertainties in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in a foreign country 

indonesia has faced political economic and social uncertainties including separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces in particular several separatist groups are opposing indonesian rule over the province of papua where our mining operations are located and have sought political independence for the province in response to demands for political independence new indonesian regional autonomy laws became effective january 1 2001 however the manner in which the new laws are being implemented and the degree of political and economic autonomy that they may bring to individual provinces including papua are uncertain and are ongoing issues in indonesian politics moreover in papua there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by 

 

 

separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the indonesian military social economic and political instability in papua could materially and adversely affect us if this instability results in damage to our property or interruption of our activities 

maintaining a good working relationship with the indonesian government is important to us because all of our mining operations are located in indonesia and are conducted pursuant to contracts of work with the indonesian government accordingly we are also subject to the usual risks associated with conducting business in and with a foreign country including the risk of forced modification of existing contracts changes in the country ’s laws and policies including those relating to taxation royalties divestment imports exports and currency and the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel or having to enforce the judgment of a foreign court or arbitration panel against a sovereign nation within its own territory in addition we are subject to the risk of expropriation and our insurance does not cover losses caused by expropriation 

in february 2006 a group of illegal gold panners engaged in conflict with indonesian police and pt freeport indonesia security personnel when they were requested to leave an area near our milling facilities following the incident the illegal panners blocked the road leading to the grasberg mine and mill in protest and we temporarily suspended mining and milling operations as a precautionary measure the panners also vandalized some of our light vehicles and offices near this area causing approximately 2 million in damages our port facilities continued to operate during the disruption and concentrate shipments were not affected the panners mostly papuans from outside our area of operations presented a list of aspirations primarily relating to their desire to share in the benefits of our existing initiatives and programs provided for the papuans who are the traditional residents of our operations area mining and milling operations resumed after an approximate fourday outage during the incident at our mine and mill protestors in jakarta vandalized the entrance floor of the office building housing our indonesian headquarters and staged a threeday rally outside the building the indonesian police handled this matter which did not disrupt our administrative functions or damage any of our facilities 

we cannot predict if there will be additional incidents similar to the february 2006 protests or other incidents that could disrupt our operations if there were additional protests at our mine and mill facilities it could materially and adversely affect our business and profitability in ways that we cannot predict at this time 

in addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry we face additional risks because our operations are located on difficult terrain in a very remote area 

our mining operations are located in steeply mountainous terrain in a very remote area in indonesia because of these conditions we have had to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities in addition the area receives considerable rainfall which has led to periodic floods and mudslides the mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time in addition to these special risks we are also subject to the usual risks associated with the mining industry such as the risk of encountering unexpected geological conditions that may result in caveins and flooding of mine areas our insurance may not sufficiently cover an unexpected natural or operating disaster 

on october 9 2003 a slippage of material occurred in a section of the grasberg open pit resulting in eight fatalities on december 12 2003 a debris flow involving a relatively small amount of loose material occurred in the same section of the open pit resulting in only minor property damage all material involved in the affected mining areas was removed the events caused us to alter our shortterm mine sequencing plans which adversely affected our 2003 and 2004 production while we resumed normal production activities in the second quarter of 2004 no assurance can be given that similar events will not occur in the future 

on march 23 2006 a mudtopsoil slide involving approximately 75000 metric tons of material occurred from a mountain ridge above service facilities supporting pt freeport indonesia’s mining facilities regrettably three contract workers were fatally injured in the event the material damaged a mess hall and an adjacent area as a result of investigations by pt freeport indonesia and the indonesian department of energy and mineral resources we conducted geotechnical studies to identify any potential hazards to facilities from slides the existing early warning system for potential slides based upon rainfall and other factors has also been expanded pt freeport indonesia recorded a charge of 19 million 10 million to net income or less than 001 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2006 for damages related to this event the event did not directly involve operations within the grasberg openpit mine or pt freeport indonesia’s milling operations 

 

the terrorist attacks in the united states on september 11 2001 subsequent attacks in indonesia and the potential for additional future terrorist acts and other recent events have created economic and political uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business and the prices of our securities 

on august 31 2002 three people were killed and 11 others were wounded in an ambush by a group of assailants the assailants shot at several vehicles transporting international contract teachers from our school in tembagapura their family members and other contractors to pt freeport indonesia on the road near tembagapura the mining town where the majority of pt freeport indonesia ’s personnel reside we along with the us government the central indonesian government the papuan provincial and local governments and leaders of the local people residing in the area of our operations condemned the attack indonesian authorities and the us fbi investigated the incident which resulted in the us indictment of an alleged operational commander of the free papua movementnational freedom force in january 2006 indonesian police accompanied by fbi agents arrested the alleged operational commander in the free papua movementnational freedom force and 11 other papuans in november 2006 verdicts and sentencing were announced for seven of the accused in the august 2002 shooting including a life sentence for the confessed leader of the attack 

on october 12 2002 a bombing killed 202 people in the indonesian province of bali which is 1500 miles west of our mining and milling operations indonesian authorities arrested 35 people in connection with this bombing and 29 of those arrested have been tried and convicted on august 5 2003 12 people were killed and over 100 others were injured by a car bomb detonated outside of the jw marriott hotel in jakarta indonesia on september 9 2004 11 people were killed and over 200 others injured by a car bomb detonated in front of the australian embassy in jakarta on october 1 2005 three suicide bombers killed 19 people and wounded over 100 others in bali the same international terrorist organizations are suspected in each of these incidents in november 2005 indonesian police raided a house in east java that resulted in the death of other accused terrorists linked to the bombings discussed above our mining and milling operations were not interrupted by these incidents but our corporate office in jakarta had to relocate for several months following the bombing in front of the australian embassy 

we cannot predict whether there will be additional incidents similar to the recent shooting or bombings if there were to be additional separatist terrorist or other violence in indonesia it could materially and adversely affect our business and profitability in ways that we cannot predict at this time 

terrorist attacks and other events have caused uncertainty in the world ’s financial and insurance markets and may significantly increase global political economic and social instability including in indonesia in addition to the bali jw marriott hotel and australian embassy bombings there have been antiamerican demonstrations in certain sections of indonesia reportedly led by radical islamic activists radical activists have also threatened to attack foreign interests and have called for the expulsion of us and british citizens and companies from indonesia 

it is possible that further acts of terrorism may be directed against the us domestically or abroad and such acts could be directed against properties and personnel of companies such as ours the attacks and the resulting economic and political uncertainties including the potential for further terrorist acts have negatively impacted insurance markets moreover while our property and business interruption insurance covers damages to insured property directly caused by terrorism this insurance does not cover damages and losses caused by war terrorism and war developments may materially and adversely affect our business and profitability and the prices of our securities in ways that we cannot predict at this time 

our profitability can vary significantly with fluctuations in the market prices of copper and gold 

our revenues are derived primarily from the sale of copper concentrates which also contain significant quantities of gold and silver and from the sale of copper cathodes and anodes although we sell most of our copper concentrates under longterm contracts the selling price is based on world metal prices at or near the time of shipment and delivery 

during 2006 the daily closing prices on the london spot market ranged from 206 to 399 per pound for copper and 521 to 726 per ounce for gold during 2005 the daily closing prices on the london spot market ranged from 139 to 211 per pound for copper and 411 to 538 per ounce for gold 

world copper prices have historically fluctuated widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

world gold prices also have historically fluctuated widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any material decrease in market prices of copper or gold would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition see our 2006 annual report incorporated herein by reference for an analysis of the effect on our revenues and net income of changes in copper and gold prices 

our contracts of work are subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations and if a dispute arises we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel 

pt freeport indonesia ’s contracts of work and other contracts of work in which we have an interest were entered into under indonesia ’s 1967 foreign capital investment law which provides guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization our contracts of work can be terminated by the government of indonesia if we do not satisfy our contractual obligations which include the payment of royalties and taxes to the government and the satisfaction of certain mining environmental safety and health requirements 

at times certain government officials and others in indonesia have questioned the validity of contracts entered into by the government of indonesia prior to may 1998 ie during the suharto regime which lasted over 30 years including pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work which was signed in december 1991 we cannot assure you that the validity of or their compliance with the contracts of work will not be challenged for political or other reasons pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work and our other contracts of work require that disputes with the indonesian government be submitted to international arbitration notwithstanding that provision if a dispute arises under the contracts of work we face the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel and if we prevail in such a dispute we will face the additional risk of having to enforce the judgment of a foreign court or arbitration panel against indonesia within its own territory 

 

indonesian government officials have periodically undertaken reviews regarding our compliance with indonesian environmental laws and regulations and the terms of the contracts of work in 2006 the government of indonesia created a joint team for “periodic evaluation on implementation of the ptfi contract of work cow” to conduct a periodic evaluation every five years the team consists of five working groups whose members are from relevant ministries or agencies covering production state revenues community development environmental issues and security issues we have conducted numerous working meetings with these groups while we believe that we comply with the contract of work in all material respects we cannot assure you that the report will conclude that we are complying with all of the provisions of pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work separately the indonesian house of representatives created a working committee on pt freeport indonesia members of this group have also visited our operations and held a number of hearings in jakarta we will continue to work with these groups to respond to their questions about our operations and our compliance with pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work 

any suspension of required activities under our contracts of work requires the consent of the indonesian government 

our contracts of work permit us to suspend certain contractually required activities including exploration for a period of one year by making a written request to the indonesian government these requests are subject to the approval of the indonesian government and are renewable annually if we do not request a suspension or are denied a suspension then we are required to continue our activities under the contract of work or potentially be declared in default moreover if a suspension continues for more than one year for reasons other than force majeure and the indonesian government has not approved such continuation then the government would be entitled to declare a default under the contract of work 

we suspended our field exploration activities outside of block a in recent years because of safety and security issues and regulatory uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest areas and an indonesian forestry law enacted in 1999 prohibiting openpit mining in forest preservation areas in 2001 we requested and received from the government of indonesia formal temporary suspensions of our obligations under the contracts of work in all areas outside of block a recent indonesian legislation permits openpit mining in pt freeport indonesia ’s block b area subject to certain requirements following an assessment of these requirements and a review of security issues we plan to resume exploration activities in certain prospective contract of work areas outside of block a in 2007 

our mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges and future changes in environmental laws or unanticipated environmental impacts from our operations could require us to incur increased costs 

mining operations on the scale of our operations in papua involve significant environmental risks and challenges our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of crushed and ground rock material called tailings that results from the process by which we physically separate the copper gold and silverbearing materials from the ore that we mine our tailings management plan uses the river system near our mine to transport the tailings to the lowlands where the tailings and natural sediments are deposited in a controlled area contained within a levee system that will be revegetated we incurred aggregate costs relating to tailings management of 128 million in 2006 87 million in 2005 and 118 million in 2004 

another major environmental challenge is managing overburden which is the rock that must be moved aside in the mining process in order to reach the ore in the presence of air water and naturally occurring bacteria some overburden can cause acid rock drainage or acidic water containing dissolved metals which if not properly managed can have a negative impact on the environment 

certain indonesian governmental officials have from time to time raised issues with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans including a suggestion that we implement a pipeline system rather than our river deposition system for tailings disposal because our mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area a pipeline system would be costly difficult to construct and maintain more prone to catastrophic failure and involve significant potentially adverse environmental issues an external panel of qualified experts as directed in our 300k andal the environmental impact assessment document submitted to the indonesian government and approved in 1997 conducted detailed reviews and analyses of a number of technical studies they concluded that all significant impacts identified were in line with the 300k andal 

 

 

predictions and that the current system of riverine tailings management was appropriate considering all sitespecific factors for these reasons we do not believe that a pipeline system is necessary or practical 

in march 2006 the indonesian ministry of environment announced the preliminary results of its proper environmental management audit acknowledging the effectiveness of pt freeport indonesia’s environmental management practices in some areas while making several suggestions for improvement in others we are working with the ministry of environment to address the issues raised as it completes the audit process 

we anticipate that we will continue to spend significant financial and managerial resources on environmental compliance in addition changes in indonesian environmental laws or unanticipated environmental impacts from our operations could require us to incur significant unanticipated costs 

the volume and grade of the reserves we recover and our rates of production may be more or less than we anticipate 

our reserve amounts are determined in accordance with established mining industry practices and standards but are estimates of the mineral deposits that can be recovered economically and legally based on currently available data our ore bodies may not conform to standard geological expectations and estimates may change as new data become available because ore bodies do not contain uniform grades of minerals our metal recovery rates will vary from time to time which will result in variations in the volumes of minerals that we can sell from period to period some of our reserves may become unprofitable to develop if there are unfavorable longterm market price fluctuations in copper and gold or if there are significant increases in our operating or capital costs in addition our exploration programs may not result in the discovery of additional mineral deposits that we can mine profitably 

we do not expect to mine all of our reserves before the initial term of our contract of work expires 

all of our current proven and probable reserves including the grasberg deposit are located in block a the initial term of our contract of work covering these reserves expires at the end of 2021 we can extend this term for two successive 10year periods subject to the approval of the indonesian government which under our contract of work cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably our reserves reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041  ie  through the expiration of the two 10year extensions and our current mine plan has been developed and our operations are based on the assumption that we will receive the two 10year extensions as a result we will not mine all of our reserves during the current term of our contract of work and there can be no assurance that the indonesian government will approve the extensions prior to the end of 2021 we expect to mine approximately 39 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable ore at december 31 2006 representing approximately 45 percent of pt freeport indonesia ’s share of recoverable copper reserves and approximately 59 percent of its share of recoverable gold reserves 

increased energy and other production costs could reduce our profitability and cash flow 

we have experienced significant increases in our production costs in recent years primarily as a result of higher energy costs and costs of other consumables higher mining costs and milling rates and higher labor costs aggregate energy costs which approximated 22 percent of our 2006 production costs primarily include purchases of diesel fuel and coal diesel prices have nearly tripled since 2002 and our coal costs are approximately 40 percent higher the costs of other consumables including steel and reagents also have increased continued increases in the cost of diesel coal and other commodities that we consume or use in our operations could adversely affect our profits and cash flow 

our business is subject to operational risks 

mines by their nature are subject to many operational risks and factors that are generally outside of our control and could impact its business operating results and cash flows these operational risks and factors include but are not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

movements in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates could negatively affect our operating results 

all of our revenues and a significant portion of our costs are denominated in us dollars however some costs and certain asset and liability accounts are denominated in indonesian rupiah australian dollars or euros as a result we are generally less profitable when the us dollar weakens in relation to these foreign currencies 

the rupiahus dollar daily closing exchange rate ranged from 8613 to 9881 rupiah per us dollar during 2006 and on december 29 2006 the closing exchange rate was 8989 rupiah per us dollar compared with 9825 rupiah per us dollar on december 30 2005 during 2006 the australian dollarus dollar daily closing exchange rate ranged from 070 to 079 per australian dollar and the eurous dollar daily closing exchange rate ranged from 118 to 134 per euro on december 29 2006 the closing exchange rates were 079 per australian dollar and 132 per euro compared with the december 30 2005 closing exchange rates of 073 per australian dollar and 118 per euro 

from time to time we have in the past and may in the future implement currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates however our hedging strategies may not be successful and any of our unhedged foreign exchange payment requirements will continue to be subject to market fluctuations in addition our bank credit facilities are based on fluctuating interest rates accordingly an increase in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

because we are a holding company our ability to pay our debts depends upon the ability of our subsidiaries to pay us dividends and to advance us funds in addition our ability to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries’ assets is generally subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries’ creditors 

because we conduct business primarily through pt freeport indonesia our major subsidiary and other subsidiaries our ability to pay our debts depends upon the earnings and cash flow of pt freeport indonesia and our other subsidiaries and their ability to pay us dividends and to advance us funds contractual and legal restrictions applicable to our subsidiaries could also limit our ability to obtain cash from them our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries’ assets upon their liquidation reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries’ creditors including any trade creditors and preferred shareholders 

 

risk factors associated with the proposed acquisition of phelps dodge 

shareholders cannot be sure of the market value of our shares that will be issued in the transaction 

upon the completion of the transaction each phelps dodge common share outstanding immediately prior to the transaction will be converted into the right to receive a combination of 067 of a share of our common stock and 8800 in cash without interest because the exchange ratio for the stock consideration is fixed in the merger agreement the market value of our common stock issued in the transaction will depend upon the market price of a share of our common stock upon the completion of the transaction this market value will fluctuate prior to the completion of the transaction and therefore may be different at the time the transaction is completed from what it was at the time the merger agreement was signed the date of this document or at the time of the shareholder meetings accordingly shareholders cannot be sure of the market value of our common stock that will be issued in the transaction or the market value of our common stock at any time after the transaction 

we may not be able to obtain the financing needed for the transaction on favorable terms 

we have received commitments from certain lenders to provide financing of up to 175 billion in the aggregate for the transaction however if the proceeds of this financing are unavailable for any reason we will be forced to obtain an alternate source of financing which may be more expensive for us may have an adverse impact on the combined company’s capital structure or may be unavailable 

the combined company will be highly leveraged and its high level of debt may limit its financial and operating flexibility 

we will be incurring significant debt to consummate the transaction and to refinance existing debt it is expected that we will utilize much of the financing to be made available pursuant to the financing commitments discussed above to fund a portion of the cash consideration payable to the phelps dodge shareholders in the transaction the combined company on a pro forma basis will have approximately 100 billion of debt under its new senior secured term credit facilities and either 60 billion in aggregate principal amount of new unsecured senior notes or a 60 billion bridge loan or some combination of the two in addition approximately 16 billion of existing debt of the combined companies will remain outstanding following the transaction the combined company is also expected to have a new 15 billion senior secured revolving credit facility with at least 10 billion of availability 

this debt could limit the combined company’s financial and operating flexibility including by requiring the combined company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flows from operations and the proceeds of equity issuances to the repayment of its debt and making the combined company more vulnerable to economic downturns additionally the combined company’s ability to satisfy financial tests or utilize thirdparty guarantees for financial assurance with respect to reclamation obligations may be adversely impacted as a result of the increase in debt 

upon consummation of the transaction we and all of our restricted subsidiaries must comply with various covenants contained in our credit agreement these covenants will among other things limit the ability of the respective restricted entities to 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the combined company will be subject to financial covenants 

 

declines in the market prices of copper gold and molybdenum could adversely affect the combined company’s earnings and cash flows and therefore its ability to repay its debt 

the earnings and cash flows of the combined company will be affected significantly by the market prices of copper and to a lesser extent gold and molybdenum the world market prices of these commodities have fluctuated historically and will be affected by numerous factors beyond the control of the combined company many financial analysts who follow the metals markets are predicting that copper prices will decline significantly from their current historically high levels over the next few years a decline in the world market price of one or more of these commodities could adversely affect the combined company’s earnings and cash flows and therefore could adversely affect its ability to repay its debt and depress its stock price 

the combined company will operate on a broader geographical scope than either we or phelps dodge has operated individually and will be exposed to a broader range of political social and geographic risks than either company has been exposed to on an individual basis 

phelps dodge conducts mining operations in the united states chile and peru and has a significant development project in the democratic republic of the congo which is expected to begin production by 2009 accordingly the business of the combined company may be adversely affected by political economic and social uncertainties in these countries in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in a foreign country because we have no significant operations in any of these countries these risks are different from and in addition to those to which our business has historically been exposed 

in addition all of the combined company’s revenues and a significant portion of its costs will be denominated in us dollars however some of its costs and certain of its asset and liability accounts will be denominated in indonesian rupiah chilean pesos peruvian nuevos soles and other foreign currencies as a result the combined company will be generally less profitable when the us dollar weakens in relation to these foreign currencies from time to time the combined company may implement currency hedges intended to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates however its hedging strategies may not be successful and any of its unhedged foreign exchange payments will continue to be subject to market fluctuations 

the impact of purchase accounting could adversely affect the combined company’s earnings 

purchase accounting will require the combined company to allocate the price being paid in the transaction to phelps dodge’s assets on the basis of their fair values at the time of the closing of the transaction those adjustments are expected to result in significant increases in the carrying values of certain acquired assets including based on preliminary estimates increases of 40 billion in metal inventories and stockpiles and 119 billion in property plant equipment and development costs as reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet contained in amendment no 2 to our form s4 filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 12 2007 the increased value of property plant equipment and development costs will increase the combined company’s depreciation expense which will reduce reported earnings but have no effect on cash flows 

a decline in the market price of commodities produced by the combined company could result in a write down of metal inventories and stockpiles to recoverable values and the recognition of impairment charges to property plant equipment and development costs in addition the increased value of metal inventories and stockpiles would cause the combined company’s cost of goods sold to increase in the year the metal in those inventories and stockpiles are recognized as sold if the combined company changes the historical method of accounting for phelps dodge’s metal inventories and stockpiles from the current method of lastin firstout this increase in the combined company’s cost of goods would occur in the near term these factors would have the effect of reducing reported earnings although they would have no effect on cash flows 

in addition the preliminary estimate of goodwill associated with the transaction is approximately 85 billion as reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet contained in amendment no 2 to our form s4 filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 12 2007 the combined company will annually assess this amount for impairment if the combined company concludes that the goodwill associated with the transaction is impaired the amount of the impairment would reduce the combined company’s reported earnings but would have no effect on cash flows 

we may experience difficulties in integrating our business with phelps dodge’s business which could cause the combined company to fail to realize many of the anticipated potential benefits of the transaction 

 

we have entered into the merger agreement because we believe that the transaction will be beneficial to our company phelps dodge and our respective shareholders achieving the anticipated benefits of the transaction will depend in part upon whether our two companies integrate our businesses in an efficient and effective manner we may not be able to accomplish this integration process smoothly or successfully the difficulties of combining the two companies’ businesses potentially will include among other things 

 

 

 

an inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the transaction as well as any delays encountered in the transition process could have an adverse effect upon the revenues level of expenses and operating results of the combined company which may affect the value of our common stock after the closing of the transaction 

the combined company will depend on its senior management team and other key employees and the loss of any of these employees could adversely affect the combined company’s business 

the success of the combined company after the transaction will depend in part upon our ability to retain senior management and other key employees of both companies competition for qualified personnel can be very intense in addition senior management and key employees may depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty or difficulty associated with the integration of the companies or a desire not to remain with the combined company accordingly no assurance can be given that we will be able to retain senior management and key employees to the same extent that they have been able to do so in the past 

resales of shares of our common stock following the transaction and future issuances of equity or equitylinked securities by us may cause the market price of shares of our common stock to fall 

as of february 12 2007 we had approximately 197 million shares of common stock outstanding approximately 23 million shares authorized for issuance upon conversion of preferred stock and convertible notes and approximately six million shares authorized for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options or the vesting of restricted stock units we expect to issue approximately 137 million shares of our common stock in connection with the transaction the issuance of these new shares and the sale of additional shares that may become eligible for sale in the public market from time to time upon the exercise of options including options that will replace existing phelps dodge options could have the effect of depressing the market price for shares of our common stock also because many phelps dodge shareholders are also our shareholders some may decide to sell rather than hold the additional shares of our common stock they will receive in the transaction the sale of those shares could also have the effect of depressing the market price for shares of our common stock 

subject to market conditions we intend to consider opportunities to reduce debt of the combined company shortly following the closing of the transaction through issuances of equity and equitylinked securities the issuance of those securities could also have the effect of depressing the market price for the shares of our common stock 

the trading price of shares of our common stock following the transaction may be affected by factors different from those affecting the trading price of phelps dodge common shares and shares of our common stock prior to the transaction 

following completion of the transaction the results of operations of the combined company as well as the trading price of our common stock may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting phelps dodge’s results of operations and the trading price of phelps dodge common shares 

 

in addition the trading price of shares of our common stock following the transaction may be affected by factors different from those affecting the trading price of shares of our common stock prior to the transaction following the transaction we will have significantly greater indebtedness and will derive a significantly smaller proportion of our revenues from gold current shareholders may decide to sell their shares as a result of those changes which could have the effect of depressing the market price of shares of our common stock

as reported in january 2006 we are responding to requests from governmental authorities in the united states and indonesia for information about pt freeport indonesia primarily relating to pt freeport indonesia’s support of indonesian security institutions as described elsewhere in this form 10k under the heading “security matters” we provide support to assist security institutions deployed and directed by the government of indonesia with infrastructure logistics and the hardship elements of posting in papua and our practices adhere to the joint us state departmentbritish foreign office voluntary principles on security and human rights we are cooperating with these requests 

the company has been named as a defendant in one of three actions brought on behalf of a purported class of all of the shareholders of phelps dodge corporation we have been named as a defendant in knisley v phelps dodge corp et al no cv2006053422 filed in the superior court of the state of arizona county of maricopa in all three class actions the plaintiffs allege breaches of fiduciary duties by the phelps dodge board of directors in connection with the merger transaction the complaints allege among other things that the named defendants engaged in selfdealing obtained personal benefits for themselves not shared equally by phelps dodge shareholders and failed to disclose all material information concerning the transaction to phelps dodge shareholders in knisley  the plaintiffs also allege that we aided and abetted such alleged violations of fiduciary duties the plaintiffs seek among other things injunctive relief barring consummation of the transaction and directing that the defendants obtain a transaction which is in the best interests of phelps dodge shareholders we as well as phelps dodge and the other named defendants believe the allegations are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the actions

general 

through our majorityowned subsidiary pt freeport indonesia we have one of the world’s largest copper and gold mining and production operations in terms of reserves and production we are also one of the lowestcost copper producers in the world after taking into account credits for related gold and silver production our principal asset is the grasberg minerals district we discovered the largest ore body in the district grasberg in 1988 based on available yearend 2004 reserve data the grasberg minerals district contains the largest single copper reserve and the largest single gold reserve of any mine in the world 

our principal operating subsidiary is pt freeport indonesia a limited liability company organized under the laws of the republic of indonesia and incorporated in delaware we own approximately 9064 percent of pt freeport indonesia and the government of indonesia owns the remaining approximate 936 percent pt freeport indonesia mines processes and explores for ore containing copper gold and silver it operates in the remote highlands of the sudirman mountain range in the province of papua indonesia which is on the western half of the island of new guinea pt freeport indonesia markets its concentrates containing copper gold and silver worldwide 

pt freeport indonesia conducts its operations pursuant to an agreement called a contract of work with the government of indonesia see “contracts of work” the contract of work allows us to conduct extensive mining production and exploration activities in a 24700acre area that we call block a which contains the grasberg minerals district and governs our rights and obligations relating to taxes exchange controls royalties repatriation and other matters the contract of work also allows us to explore for minerals in an approximately 500000acre area that we call block b exploration activities in block b have been suspended in recent years but we continue to assess the possible timing for the resumption of those activities the term of our contract of work expires in 2021 but we can extend it for two 10year periods subject to indonesian government approval which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably 

another of our operating subsidiaries pt irja eastern minerals which we refer to as eastern minerals holds an additional contract of work in papua covering approximately 12 million acres eastern minerals conducts exploration activities which have been suspended in recent years under this contract of work see “contracts of work” we continue to assess the possible timing for the resumption of exploration activities in eastern minerals’ exploration area we have a 100 percent ownership interest in eastern minerals 

in 1996 we established joint ventures with rio tinto plc which is an international mining company with headquarters in london england rio tinto conducts mining operations in north america south america asia australia europe and southern africa one of our joint ventures with rio tinto covers pt freeport indonesia ’s mining operations in block a this joint venture gives rio tinto through 2021 a 40 percent interest in certain assets and in production above specified levels from operations in block a and after 2021 a 40 percent interest in all production in block a under our joint venture arrangements rio tinto also has a 40 percent interest in pt freeport indonesia ’s contract of work and eastern minerals ’ contract of work in addition rio tinto has the option to participate in 40 percent of any of our other future exploration projects in papua to date rio tinto has elected to participate in all exploration projects including pt nabire bakti mining 

under a joint venture agreement through pt nabire bakti mining we conduct exploration activities which have been suspended in recent years see “contracts of work” in an area covering approximately 500000 acres in five parcels contiguous to pt freeport indonesia ’s block b and one of eastern minerals ’ blocks we continue to assess the possible timing for the resumption of exploration activities in pt nabire bakti mining ’s exploration area 

 

at december 31 2005 pt freeport indonesia’s share of proven and probable recoverable reserves totaled 403 billion pounds of copper and 439 million ounces of gold all of which are located in block a our approximate 9064 percent equity share of these proven and probable recoverable reserves totaled 365 billion pounds of copper and 398 million ounces of gold see “ore reserves” in this annual report we refer to 1 aggregate reserves which means all reserves for the operations we manage 2 pt freeport indonesia’s share of reserves which means the reserves net of rio tinto’s interest under our joint venture arrangements and which are the reserves reported as those of our operations in our consolidated financial statements and 3 our equity share of reserves which is net of the 936 percent of pt freeport indoneisa owned by the government of indonesia 

in july 2003 we acquired the 857 percent ownership interest in pt puncakjaya power owned by affiliates of duke energy corporation puncakjaya power is the owner of assets supplying power to pt freeport indonesia’s operations including the 3x65 megawatt coalfired power facilities see “infrastructure” 

we also smelt and refine copper concentrates in spain and market the refined copper products through our wholly owned subsidiary atlantic copper sa in addition pt freeport indonesia has a 25 percent interest in pt smelting an indonesian company that operates a copper smelter and refinery in gresik indonesia these smelters play an important role in our concentrate marketing strategy as approximately onehalf of pt freeport indonesia ’s concentrate production has been sold to atlantic copper and pt smelting over the last several years see “investment in smelters”

contracts of work 

through contracts of work with the government of indonesia pt freeport indonesia and eastern minerals conduct their current exploration operations and pt freeport indonesia conducts its mining operations in indonesia both contracts of work govern our rights and obligations relating to taxes exchange controls royalties repatriation and other matters both contracts of work were concluded pursuant to the 1967 foreign capital investment law which expresses indonesia ’s foreign investment policy and provides basic guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization a framework for economic incentives and basic rules regarding other rights and obligations of foreign investors specifically the contracts of work provide that the government of indonesia will not nationalize or expropriate pt freeport indonesia ’s or eastern minerals’ mining operations any disputes regarding the provisions of the contracts of work are subject to international arbitration we have experienced no disputes requiring arbitration during the 38 years we have operated in indonesia 

pt freeport indonesia ’s contract of work covers both block a which was first included in a 1967 contract of work that was replaced by a new contract of work in 1991 and block b to which we gained rights in 1991 the initial term of our contract of work expires in december 2021 but we can extend it for two 10year periods subject to indonesian government approval which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably we originally had the rights to explore 65 million acres in block b but pursuant to the contract of work we have only retained the rights to approximately 500000 acres following significant geological assessment 

eastern minerals signed its contract of work in august 1994 the contract of work originally covered approximately 25 million acres eastern minerals contract of work provides for a fourtoseven year exploratory term and a 30year term for mining operations subject to indonesian government approval which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably we can extend this period for two 10year periods eastern minerals’ contract of work requires us to relinquish our rights to 25 percent of the original 25millionacre contract of work area at the end of each of three specified periods as of december 31 2005 we had relinquished approximately 13 million acres and must relinquish an additional 06 million acres at the end of the threeyear exploration period currently in suspension which can be extended by the government of indonesia for as many as two additional years 

we suspended our exploration activities outside of block a in recent years because of safety and security issues and regulatory uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest areas and an indonesian forestry law enacted in 1999 prohibiting openpit mining in forest preservation areas in 2001 we requested and received from the government of indonesia formal temporary suspensions of our obligations under the contracts of work in all areas outside block a the current suspensions were granted for oneyear periods ending february 26 2006 for block b march 31 2006 for pt nabire bakti mining and november 15 2006 for eastern minerals we have requested additional oneyear suspensions for block b and pt nabire bakti mining recent indonesian legislation permits openpit mining in pt freeport indonesia ’s block b area subject to certain requirements we continue to assess these requirements and security issues the timing for our resumption of exploration activities in our contract of work areas outside block a depends on the resolution of these matters 

pt freeport indonesia pays a copper royalty under its contact of work that varies from 15 percent of copper net revenue at a copper price of 090 or less per pound to 35 percent at a copper price of 110 or more per pound the contract of work royalty rate for gold and silver sales is 10 percent 

a large part of the mineral royalties under government of indonesia regulations are designated to the provinces from which the minerals are extracted in connection with our “fourth concentrator mill expansion” pt freeport indonesia agreed to pay the government of indonesia additional royalties royalties not required by our contract of work to provide further support to the local governments and the people of papua pt freeport indonesia pays the additional royalties on metal from production above 200000 metric tons of ore per day the additional royalty for copper equals the contract of work royalty rate and for gold and silver equals twice the contract of work royalty rates therefore our royalty rate on copper net revenues from production above 200000 metric tons of ore per day is double the contract of work royalty rate and our royalty rates on gold and silver sales from production above 200000 metric tons of ore per day are triple the contract of work royalty rates 

 

pt freeport indonesia ’s share of the combined royalties including the additional royalties which became effective january 1 1999 totaled 1037 million in 2005 435 million in 2004 and 265 million in 2003 

 

 

republic of indonesia 

general the republic of indonesia consists of more than 17000 islands stretching 3000 miles along the equator from malaysia to australia and is the fourth most populous nation in the world with over 240 million people following many years of dutch colonial rule indonesia gained independence in 1945 and now has a presidential republic system of government 

our mining complex was indonesia ’s first copper mining project and was the first major foreign investment in indonesia following the economic development program instituted by the indonesian government in 1967 we work closely with the central provincial and local governments in development efforts in the area surrounding our operations we have had positive relations with the indonesian government since we commenced business activities in indonesia in 1967 and we intend to continue to maintain positive working relationships with the central provincial and local branches of the indonesian government 

political developments in may 1998 president suharto indonesia ’s political leader for more than 30 years resigned in the wake of an economic crisis in indonesia and other parts of southeast asia and in the face of growing social unrest vice president bj habibie succeeded suharto in june 1999 indonesia held a new parliamentary election on a generally peaceful basis as the first step in the process of electing a new president in october 1999 in accordance with the indonesian constitution the country ’s highest political institution the people ’s consultative assembly composed of the newly elected national parliament along with additional provincial and other representatives elected abdurrahman wahid as president and megawati sukarnoputri as vice president in the nationals first direct persidential election 

there were repeated challenges to the political leadership of president wahid after his election in october 1999 in july 2001 the people ’s consultative assembly voted to remove president wahid and elected vice president megawati sukarnoputri as president in october 2004 susilo bambang yudhoyono was elected as president in the nations first direct persidential election 

other developments   in february 2006 a group of illegal gold panners engaged in conflict with indonesian police and pt freeport indonesia security personnel when they were requested to leave an area near our milling facilities following the incident the illegal panners blocked the road leading to the grasberg mine and mill in protest and we temporarily suspended mining and milling operations as a precautionary measure the panners also vandalized some of our light vehicles and offices near this area causing approximately 4 million in damages our port facilities continued to operate during the disruption and concentrate shipments were not affected the panners mostly papuans from outside our area of operations presented a list of aspirations primarily relating to their desire to share in the benefits of our existing initiatives and programs provided for the papuans who are the traditional residents of our operations area mining and milling operations resumed after an approximate fourday outage during the incident at our mine and mill protestors in jakarta vandalized the entrance floor of the office building housing our indonesian headquarters and staged a threeday rally outside the building the indonesian police handled this matter which did not disrupt our administrative functions or damage any of our facilities  

on august 31 2002 three people were killed and 11 others were wounded in an ambush by a group of unidentified assailants the assailants shot at several vehicles transporting international contract teachers from pt freeport indonesia ’s school in tembagapura their family members and other contractors to pt freeport indonesia on the road near tembagapura the mining town where the majority of pt freeport indonesia ’s personnel reside indonesian authorities and the united states federal bureau of investigation fbi investigated the incident which resulted in the us indictment of an alleged operational commander in the free papua movementnational freedom force in january 2006 indonesian police arrested this individual and 11 other papuans 

on october 12 2002 a bombing killed 202 people in the indonesian province of bali which is 1500 miles west of our mining and milling operations indonesian authorities arrested 35 people in connection with this bombing and 29 of those arrested have been tried and convicted on august 5 2003 12 people were killed and over 100 others were injured by a car bomb detonated outside of the jw marriott hotel in jakarta indonesia on september 9 2004 11 people were killed and over 200 others injured by a car bomb detonated in front of the australian embassy on october 1 2005 three suicide bombers killed 19 people and wounded over 100 others in bali international terrorist organizations are suspected in each of these incidents in november 2005 indonesian police raided a house in east java that resulted in the death of other accused terrorists linked to these bombings our mining and milling operations were not interrupted by these incidents but our corporate offices in jakarta sustained damages and relocated for several months as a result of the september 2004 bombing 

 

the government of indonesia which provides security for pt freeport indonesia ’s personnel and operations see “security matters” has expressed a strong commitment to protect natural resources businesses operating in indonesia including pt freeport indonesia with heightened security following the incidents discussed above 

economic and social conditions the indonesian economy grew by an estimated 6 percent in 2005 and 5 percent in 2004 the indonesian currency the rupiah averaged approximately 9700 rupiah to one united states us dollar during 2005 and closed at 9825 rupiah to one us dollar on december 30 2005 compared with 9270 rupiah to one us dollar on december 31 2004 

despite gradual improvements on the economic front indonesia ’s recovery remains vulnerable to ongoing political and social tensions incidents of violence and separatist pressures continue to occur proindependence movements have been prominent in certain areas especially in the province of aceh and to a lesser extent in papua in 2005 the government of indonesia and the free aceh movement reached a peace agreement which included the withdrawal of 24000 military troops from aceh subsequently the us restored full relations with the indonesian military after a 14year moratorium partly because of the successes by the government of indonesia in fighting terrorism and in reaching a peaceful agreement in aceh 

the area surrounding our mining development is sparsely populated by indigenous people and former residents of other areas of indonesia some of whom have resettled in papua under the government of indonesia ’s transmigration program a segment of the local population is opposing indonesian rule over papua and several separatist groups have sought political independence for the province in addition to the august 31 2002 shooting incident there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the indonesian military in papua 

in 2001 new autonomy laws became effective in indonesia the laws were intended to shift a greater share of revenues and greater control of economic regulatory and social affairs to indonesia’s 31 provinces and over 300 regencies the central government and the provinces continue to consider the implementation and administration of these new responsibilities 

our contracts of work and the government of indonesia the indonesian government has repeatedly assured investors that existing contracts would be honored in our 38 years of operating in indonesia the indonesian government has always honored its commitments to us our belief that our contracts of work will continue to be honored is further supported by us laws which prohibit us aid to countries that nationalize property owned by or take steps to nullify a contract with a us citizen or company at least 50 percent owned by us citizens if the foreign country does not within a reasonable time take appropriate steps to provide full value compensation or other relief under international law 

in july 2004 we received a request from the indonesian department of energy and mineral resources that we offer to sell shares in pt indocopper investama to indonesian nationals at fair market value pt indocopper investama which we wholly own has an approximate 936 percent ownership interest in pt freeport indonesia in response to this request and in view of the potential benefits of having additional indonesian ownership in our operations we have agreed to consider a potential sale of an interest in pt indocopper investama at fair market value neither our contract of work nor indonesian law requires us to divest any portion of our ownership interest in pt freeport indonesia or pt indocopper investama we have received no offers for our ownership interest 

our investment in indonesia and papua we have a boardapproved policy on social employment and human rights and have comprehensive and extensive social cultural and community development programs to which we have committed significant financial and managerial resources see “social development employment and human rights” these policies and programs are designed to address the impact of our operations on the local villages and people and to provide assistance for the development of the local people while we believe these efforts serve to avoid damage to and disruptions of our operations our operations could be adversely affected by social economic and political forces beyond our control 

pt freeport indonesia contributes to the economies of papua and the republic of indonesia through the payment of taxes dividends and royalties economic development programs infrastructure development employment and the purchase of local and national goods pt freeport indonesia has frequently been one of the largest taxpayers in the republic of indonesia in addition it pays royalties on all minerals removed from the ground royalty payments are based on the volumes and prices of minerals sold in accordance with the terms of pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work as discussed above 

 

since it began development activities more than 35 years ago pt freeport indonesia has made significant investments in infrastructure both for its use and for use by the papuan public these infrastructure improvements include medical facilities roads an airport and heliports schools housing community buildings and places of worship 

pt freeport indonesia is also one of the largest private employers in indonesia and by far the largest in papua as of december 31 2005 pt freeport indonesia directly employed 8044 people and 6225 contract workers provided services to pt freeport indonesia in addition 4475 persons worked for privatized companies providing services within pt freeport indonesia ’s operations area 

besides the estimated 39 billion in direct benefits from taxes royalties dividends and fees payable to the indonesian government under the contract of work from 1992 through 2005 pt freeport indonesia’s operations have provided another 100 billion during this period in indirect benefits to papua and the republic of indonesia in the form of wages and benefits paid to workers purchases of goods and services charitable contributions and reinvestments in operations for 2005 direct benefits totaled approximately 12 million and indirect benefits totaled approximately 736 million 

ore reserves 

during 2005 net additions and revisions to the aggregate proven and probable reserves of the grasberg and other block a ore bodies in the grasberg minerals district totaled approximately 132 million metric tons of ore representing increases of 21 billion recoverable pounds of copper 04 million recoverable ounces of gold and 121 million recoverable ounces of silver the additions were primarily the result of positive drilling results at the mill level zone and deep mill level zone deposits a 345millionmetricton complex with average ore grades of 106 percent copper and 083 grams per metric ton gt of gold and at the grasberg underground extension to the kucing liar deposit a 579millionmetricton complex with average ore grades of 120 percent copper and 106 gt of gold completion of a successful feasibility study at big gossan also contributed to these gains yearend aggregate proven and probable recoverable reserves net of 2005 production were 28 billion metric tons of ore averaging 107 percent copper 092 gt of gold and 402 gt of silver representing 566 billion pounds of copper 580 million ounces of gold and 1808 million ounces of silver our aggregate exploration budget for 2006 including rio tinto ’s share is expected to total approximately 15 million 10 million for our share with most of the efforts focused on potential extensions of the grasberg underground and kucing liar mine complex and testing downward extensions of the previously mined ertsberg deposit we continue to assess the timing of resumption of suspended exploration activities in areas outside the existing producing area of the grasberg minerals district 

pursuant to joint venture arrangements between pt freeport indonesia and rio tinto rio tinto has a 40 percent interest in production from reserves above those reported at december 31 1994 net of rio tinto ’s share pt freeport indonesia ’s share of proven and probable recoverable reserves as of december 31 2005 was 403 billion pounds of copper 439 million ounces of gold and 1270 million ounces of silver fcx ’s equity interest in proven and probable recoverable reserves as of december 31 2005 was 365 billion pounds of copper 398 million ounces of gold and 1151 million ounces of silver we estimated recoverable reserves using a copper price of 090 per pound and a gold price of 350 per ounce if metal prices were adjusted to the approximate average london spot prices for the past three years ie copper prices adjusted from 090 per pound to 126 per pound and gold prices adjusted from 350 per ounce to 406 per ounce the resulting additional proven and probable reserves would not be material to our reported reserves 

all of our proven and probable recoverable reserves lie within block a aggregate grasberg open pit and underground proven and probable recoverable ore reserves as of december 31 2005 are shown below along with those of our other deposits reserve calculations were prepared by our employees under the supervision of george d macdonald our vice president of exploration and were reviewed and verified by independent mining consultants inc experts in mining geology and reserve determination see “risk factors” we developed our current mine plan based on completing the mining of all of our currently designated recoverable reserves before the end of 2041 which would be the expiration of our contract of work including the two 10year extensions discussed above prior to the expiration of the initial term of our contract of work in december 2021 under our current mine plan we expect to mine approximately 44 percent of aggregate proven and probable ore representing approximately 52 percent of pt freeport indonesia ’s share of recoverable copper reserves and approximately 65 percent of pt freeport indonesia ’s share of recoverable gold reserves 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in defining its openpit reserves pt freeport indonesia applies an “economic cutoff grade” strategy the objective of this strategy is to maximize the net present value of its operations pt freeport indonesia uses a breakeven cutoff grade to define the insitu reserves for its underground ore bodies the breakeven cutoff grade is defined for a metric ton of ore as that equivalent copper grade once produced and sold that generates sufficient revenue to cover all operating and administrative costs associated with its production 

our reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies we conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk we revise our mine plans and estimates of proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies 

pt freeport indonesia’s ores contain three commercially recoverable metals copper gold and silver we value all three metals in terms of a copper equivalent percentage to determine a single breakeven cutoff grade copper equivalent percentage is used to express the relative value of multimetal ores in terms of one metal the calculation expresses the relative value of the ore using estimates of contained metal quantities metals prices as used for reserve 

 

 

determination recovery rates treatment charges and royalties the table below shows the breakeven cutoff grade expressed as a copper equivalent percentage for each of our existing ore bodies as of december 31 2005 

 

the following table sets forth the average drill hole spacing for each of our ore bodies drill hole spacing data are used by mining professionals such as mining engineers in determining the suitability of data coverage on a relative basis in a given deposit type and mining method scenario so as to achieve a given level of confidence in the resource estimate drill hole spacing is only one of several criteria necessary to establish resource classification drilling programs are typically designed to achieve an optimum sample spacing to support the level of confidence in results that apply to a particular stage of development of a mineral deposit we calculate the average drill hole spacing within each ore body using the distance from the center of each block in the resource model to the nearest drill hole composite we then calculate the averages of these values within the volume of each ore body and reported them under the column entitled “average distance to nearest sample” this value represents at least onehalf of the average drill hole spacing within each deposit we calculate the value under the column entitled “average distance between drill holes” by multiplying the average minimum distance value by two and this value represents the maximum average drill hole spacing 

 

mining operations  mines in production 

we and our predecessors have conducted exploration and mining operations in block a since 1967 and have been the only operator of these operations we currently have two mines in operation the grasberg open pit and the deep ore zone 

grasberg open pit   we began openpit mining of the grasberg ore body in 1990 openpit operations are expected to continue until 2015 at which time the grasberg underground mining operations are scheduled to begin 

production is currently at the 3385 to 4060meter elevation level and totaled 603 million metric tons of ore in 2005 and 489 million metric tons of ore in 2004 which provided 81 percent of our 2005 mill feed and 76 percent of our 2004 mill feed our openpit mining rate including ore and overburden totaled 691600 metric tons per day in 2005 and 592700 metric tons per day in 2004 annual production rates are expected to range between 650000 metric tons per day and 750000 metric tons per day through 2010 and then decline through 2015 the grasberg open pit is fully developed and we expect to incur only maintenance capital costs with respect to the grasberg open pit during its remaining life 

the current grasberg equipment fleet consists of over 800 pieces of equipment as of december 31 2005 the larger mining equipment directly associated with production of the grasberg open pit includes 164 haul trucks with payloads ranging from approximately 70 metric tons to 330 metric tons 18 shovels with bucket sizes ranging from 15 cubic meters to 42 cubic meters and 62 bulldozers and graders we believe our current equipment level is adequate to meet our projected production levels over the remaining life of the pit 

grasberg crushing and conveying systems are integral to the mine and provide the capacity to transport up to 225000 metric tons per day of grasberg ore to the mill and 135000 metric tons per day of overburden to the overburden stockpiles 

mining costs are charged to operations as incurred however because of the configuration and location of the grasberg openpit ore body and the location and extent of the related surrounding overburden the ratio of overburden to ore is much higher in the initial mining of the open pit than in later years in 2005 and years prior surface mining costs associated with overburden removal at pt freeport indonesia’s grasberg openpit mine that were estimated to relate to future production were initially deferred when the ratio of actual overburden removed to ore mined exceeded the estimated average ratio of overburden removed to ore mined over the life of the grasberg openpit mine as projected in our most recent mine plan those deferred costs were to be charged subsequently to operating costs when the ratio of actual overburden removed to ore mined fell below the estimated average ratio of overburden to ore over the life of the grasberg openpit mine the reserve quantities used to develop the life of mine ratio are the proven and probable ore quantities for the grasberg open pit shown above 

in the mining industry the costs of removing overburden and waste material to access mineral deposits are referred to as “stripping costs” through 2005 we applied the deferred mining cost method in accounting for our postproduction stripping costs the deferred mining cost method has been used by some companies in the metals mining industry however industry practice has varied the deferred mining cost method matches the cost of production with the sale of the related metal from the open pit by assigning each metric ton of ore removed an equivalent amount of overburden tonnage thereby averaging overburden removal costs over the life of the mine the mining cost capitalized in inventory and the amounts charged to cost of goods sold do not represent the actual costs incurred to mine the ore in any given period the application of the deferred mining cost method resulted in an asset on our balance sheets “deferred mining costs” totaling 2854 million at december 31 2005 and 2204 million at december 31 2004 see note 1 

in march 2005 the financial accounting standards board fasb ratified emerging issues task force eitf issue no 046 “accounting for stripping costs incurred during production in the mining industry” eitf 046 see note 1 which requires that stripping costs incurred during production be considered costs of the extracted minerals and recognized as a component of inventory to be recognized in cost of sales in the same period as the revenue from the sale of inventory as a result capitalization of stripping costs incurred during production is appropriate only to the extent product inventory exists at the end of a reporting period the guidance in eitf 046 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 companies may apply this guidance either by recognition of a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the period of adoption or by restating prior period financial statements we adopted the guidance on january 1 2006 with the most significant impacts of adoption being the deferred mining costs asset on our balance sheet on that date 2854 million was recorded net of taxes minority interest share and inventory effects 1359 million as a cumulative effect adjustment to reduce our retained earnings stripping costs incurred in 2006 and later periods will now effectively be charged to cost of sales as incurred adoption of the new guidance has no impact on our cash flows the pro forma impact of applying eitf 046 would be to reduce net income by 353 million or 016 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2005 394 million or 021 per share for the year ended december 31 2004 and 338 million or 021 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2003 these pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of what charges may be for future periods 

 

deep ore zone the deep ore zone ore body lies vertically below the now depleted intermediate ore zone ore body we began production from the deep ore zone ore body in 1989 but we suspended production in 1991 in favor of production from the grasberg deposit production using the blockcave method resumed in september 2000 production is at the 3110meter elevation level and totaled 153 million metric tons of ore in 2005 and 159 million metric tons of ore in 2004 the deep ore zone has performed above design capacity of 35000 metric tons of ore per day we are expanding the deep ore zone operation to a sustained rate of 50000 metric tons of ore per day with the installation of a second crusher and additional ventilation production from the deep ore zone averaged 42000 metric tons of ore per day in 2005 and 43600 metric tons of ore per day in 2004 

the deep ore zone mine fleet consists of over 140 pieces of mobile heavy equipment the primary mining equipment directly associated with production and development includes 41 loadhauldump lhd units and 14 haul trucks our lhd units typically carry approximately 11 metric tons of ore using orepasses and chutes the lhd units transfer ore into 55ton capacity haul trucks the trucks dump into a gyratory crusher and ore is then conveyed to the surface stockpiles 

during 2005 at the deep ore zone mine we completed over 10000 meters of development drifting in support of the blockcave mining method and the ongoing expansion to 50000 metric tons of ore per day the expansion to a sustained rate of 50000 metric tons of ore per day with the installation of a second crusher and additional ventilation is expected to be completed in 2007 the aggregate development costs for the deep ore zone expansion is expected to approximate 62 million approximately 37 million for pt freeport indonesia’s share through the projected 2007 rampup the deep ore zone mine a block cave operation is one of the world’s largest underground mines 

our development costs include costs incurred resulting from mine preproduction activities undertaken to gain access to proven and probable reserves including adits drifts ramps permanent excavations infrastructure and removal of overburden depreciation for mining and milling lifeofmine assets is determined using the unitofproduction method based on estimated recoverable proven and probable copper reserves development costs that relate to a specific ore body are depreciated using the unitofproduction method based on estimated recoverable proven and probable copper reserves for the ore body benefited pt freeport indonesia’s total development costs at december 31 2005 for the deep ore zone mine currently our only operating underground mine totaled approximately 220 million which are being depreciated on a unitofproduction basis over the life of the deep ore zone proven and probable reserves see note 1 

the majority of maintenance activities are performed on site by a combination of pt freeport indonesia employees and contract workers as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 7500 employees and contract workers directly involved in grasberg openpit and deep ore zone underground mining milling and ore flow operations 

  the intermediate ore zone was an underground blockcave operation that began production in 1994 the intermediate ore zone was depleted in 2003 production totaled 25 million metric tons of ore in 2003 during its 10year life the intermediate ore zone operation produced almost 30 percent more copper and gold than the initial reserve estimates 

our principal source of power for all our operations is a coalfired power plant that we built in conjunction with our fourth concentrator expansion see “infrastructure” diesel generators supply peaking and backup electrical power generating capacity a combination of naturally occurring mountain streams and water derived from our underground operations provides water for our operations the average annual rainfall in the project area is 180 inches 

mining operations  mines in development 

seven other ore bodies the underground grasberg kucing liar mill level zone deep mill level zone ertsberg stockwork zone big gossan and the dom are located in block a these ore bodies are at various stages of development and are included in our proven and probable recoverable reserves we continually review our operations development opportunities to maximize the value of the reserves we incurred 126 million for mine development expansion and infrastructure capital expenditures related to these ore bodies and 452 million for common underground infrastructure development during the three years ended december 31 2005 see “risk factors” 

the underground grasberg reserves will be mined using the blockcave method at the end of openpit mining which 

 

 

is expected to continue until approximately 2015 the kucing liar ore body lies on the southern flank of and underneath the southern portion of the grasberg open pit at the 2605 to 3115meter elevation level we expect to mine the kucing liar ore body using the blockcave method 

the mill level zone ore body lies directly below the deep ore zone mine at the 2890meter elevation the deep mill level zone ore body lies beneath the mill level zone ore body at the 2590meter elevation this ore represents the downward continuation of mineralization in the ertsberg east skarn system and neighboring ertsberg porphyry drilling efforts continue to determine the extent of these ore bodies we expect to mine the mill level zone ore body using a blockcave method near completion of mining at the deep ore zone ore body near the end of mining the mill level zone ore body we expect to mine the deep mill level zone ore body also using a blockcave method 

the ertsberg stockwork zone ore body extends off the southwest side of the deep ore zone ore body at the 3126 to 3626meter elevation level drilling efforts continue to determine the extent of this ore body which we expect to mine using a blockcave method starting in about 2009 

the big gossan ore body is located approximately 1000 meters southwest of the original ertsberg openpit deposit we began the initial underground development of the ore body in 1993 when we drove tunnels from the mill area into the ore zone at the 3000meter elevation level a stope and fill mining method will be used on the big gossan deposit in 2005 we completed a feasibility study and an update to the sitewide development plan to determine the timing of initial production currently projected to be 2008 

the dom ore body lies approximately 1500 meters southeast of the depleted ertsberg openpit deposit production at the openpit and underground portions of the ore body will begin after completion of openpit mining at grasberg 

the projected aggregate capital expenditures required to reach full production capacity for each of our undeveloped ore bodies based on our latest mine plans and our proven and probable recoverable reserves as of december 31 2005 are shown below in millions of us dollars actual costs could differ materially from these estimates as we will not incur most of the expenditures for several years and we will incur them over a period of several years in addition to the mine development costs below our current mine development plans include approximately 1 billion of capital expenditures at our processing facilities to optimize the handling of underground ore types once grasberg openpit operations cease we continue to review our processing plans to maximize the value of our reserves based on our current estimates we expect aggregate expenditures will range between 40 million and 330 million annually during the next 15 years in addition these costs will be shared with rio tinto in accordance with our joint venture agreement 

 

 

description of ore bodies our ore bodies are located within and around two main igneous intrusions the grasberg monzodiorite and the ertsberg diorite the host rocks of these ore bodies include both carbonate and clastic rocks that form the ridge crests and upper flanks of the sudirman range and the igneous rocks of monzonitic to dioritic composition that intrude them the igneoushosted ore bodies the grasberg open pit and block cave and the ertsberg stockwork zone block cave occur as vein stockworks and disseminations of copper sulphides dominated by chalcopyrite and to a much lesser extent bornite the sedimentaryrock hosted ore bodies occur as “magnetiterich calciummagnesian skarn” replacements whose location and orientation are strongly influenced by major faults and by the chemistry of the carbonate rocks along the margins of the intrusions 

the copper mineralization in these skarn deposits is also dominated by chalcopyrite but higher bornite concentrations are common moreover gold occurs in significant concentrations in all of the district ’s ore bodies though rarely visible to the naked eye these gold concentrations usually occur as inclusions within the copper sulphide minerals though in some deposits these concentrations can also be strongly associated with pyrite 

 

 

the following diagram indicates the relative elevations in meters of our reported reserve ore bodies 

 

 

the following map which encompasses an area of approximately 42 square kilometers approximately 16 square miles indicates the relative positions and sizes of our reported reserve ore bodies and their locations 

 

 

the following chart illustrates our current plans for sequencing and producing each of our ore bodies and the years in which we currently expect that production of each ore body will begin and end production volumes are typically lower in the first few years of each ore body as development activities are ongoing and as the mine ramps up to full production currently the grasberg open pit and deep ore zone are our only producing mines the ultimate timing of the start of production from our undeveloped mines is dependent upon a number of factors including the results of our exploration efforts and may vary from the dates shown below in addition we develop our mine plans for the grasberg open pit and underground mines based on maximizing the net present value from the ore bodies 

 

during 2005 we mined an average of 733600 metric tons of material per day including ore and overburden we do not require any additional approvals for higher mining rates during 2004 we mined an average of 636200 metric tons of material per day the following chart illustrates our current aggregate mill capacity our aggregate permitted mill capacity and our projected milling rates mill capacity will vary with the ore type being processed the decline in milling rates in 2016 reflects the expected completion date of openpit mining at the grasberg ore body we are continuing to develop mine plans to optimize production levels 

 

milling and production 

the ore from our mines moves by a conveyor system to a series of shafts through which it drops to our milling and concentrating complex located approximately 2900 meters above sea level at the mill the ore is crushed and ground and mixed in tanks with water and small amounts of flotation reagents where it is continuously agitated with air during this physical separation process copper gold and silverbearing particles rise to the top of the tanks and are collected and thickened into a concentrate the concentrate leaves the mill complex as a slurry consisting of approximately 65 percent solids by weight and is pumped through three parallel 115kilometer pipelines to our coastal port site facility at amamapare where it is filtered dried and stored for shipping ships are loaded at dock facilities at the port until they draw their maximum dockside water and they then move to deeper water where loading is completed from shuttling barges 

our production results for the last three years are as follows

mill throughput and production improved significantly in 2005 compared to 2004 which was negatively affected by pt freeport indonesia ’s efforts to accelerate removal of overburden material and restore safe access to highergrade areas in the pit see below mill throughput averaged 216200 metric tons of ore per day in 2005 a 17 percent increase from the 185100 metric tons average in 2005 copper and gold production was higher in 2005 compared with 2004 reflecting the higher mill throughput and higher average ore grades copper production for 2005 totaled 146 billion pounds 4594 million pounds higher than 2004 production gold production for 2005 totaled 279 million ounces 13 million ounces higher than 2004 production the higher sales volumes and the primarily fixed nature of a large portion of pt freeport indonesia ’s cost structure resulted in average unit net cash costs for 2005 decreasing to 007 per pound compared with 040 per pound for 2004 

in october 2003 a slippage of material occurred in a section of the grasberg open pit and in december 2003 a smaller debris flow occurred in the same section the area affected by the slippage events included two active mining areas which were scheduled to be mined in the fourth quarter of 2003 see “grasberg openpit slippage” mill throughput and production in 2003 and 2004 were negatively affected by pt freeport indonesia ’s efforts to accelerate removal of overburden material and restore safe access to highergrade areas in the pit mill throughput averaged 185100 metric tons of ore per day in 2004 a nine percent decrease from the 203000 metric tons average in 2003 copper and gold production was lower in 2004 compared with 2003 reflecting the lower mill throughput and lower average ore grades copper production for 2004 totaled 10 billion pounds 295 million pounds lower than 2003 production gold production for 2004 totaled 146 million ounces 10 million ounces lower than 2003 production the lower sales volumes and the primarily fixed nature of a large portion of pt freeport indonesia ’s cost structure resulted in average unit net cash costs for 2004 increasing to 040 per pound compared with a net credit of 002 per pound for 2003 average unit net cash costs per pound of copper totaled a net credit of 002 per pound for 2003 which was an annual record low 

because of the fixed nature of a large portion of our costs unit costs vary significantly from period to period depending on volumes of copper and gold sold during the period in addition we have experienced significant increases in our production costs in recent years primarily as a result of higher energy costs and costs of other consumables higher mining costs and milling rates labor costs and other factors once we complete our openpit mining operations at the grasberg mine in approximately 2015 and transition to underground we expect our share of annual copper and gold production to be lower than current levels and all other factors being equal our average unit net cash costs to increase for more information regarding our operating and financial results see our 2005 annual report incorporated herein by reference 

we estimate our share of sales for 2006 to approximate 13 billion pounds of copper and 17 million ounces of gold average annual sales volumes over the fiveyear period from 2006 through 2010 are expected to approximate 13 billion pounds of copper and 19 million ounces of gold as a result of lower than targeted mining rates ore from a highgrade section in the primary ore area “6 north” of the grasberg open pit previously expected to be mined in late 2006 has been deferred to early 2007 accordingly our current mine plans alter the timing of subsequent years’ ore production compared with previous plans these revised production estimates do not have a significant economic effect since the deferrals occur within months of overlapping annual periods efforts are under way to improve productivity of mining activities which would increase mining rates and advance the timing of metal production see “risk factors” 

geotechnical programs 

our geotechnical programs support several phases of the operations including our openpit mine pit slope and overburden stockpile stability our underground mine our infrastructure and our tailings management program for information regarding our tailings management program see “environmental matters” 

a group of our senior level employees has the responsibility authority and oversight for our overall geotechnical programs our multidisciplinary approach combines inhouse personnel with backgrounds in civil geotechnical mining engineering geology and hydrology to form a technical services group that reports to our senior managers our technical services group develops information that our mine engineering group uses to develop mine and stockpile designs production schedules and related plans our technical services group also monitors slope stability and other geotechnical and hydrological developments 

our technical services group is composed of expatriates and indonesian nationals who are university educated international consulting experts in each of the applicable technical fields support this group inhouse training provided by consultants as well as offsite seminars and industry conferences supports the training of our staff our 

 

 

joint venture partner has also provided geotechnical and engineering support to our operations consultants and our joint venture partner provide input into program development and assess performance of these critical roles 

our technical services group uses information from geological drilling for the development and updating of our geological geotechnical and hydrologic models we develop computerbased geologic models for mine design and dewatering programs we provide continuous ground and slope monitoring in our mines and on overburden stockpiles using various computerized and automated systems we also daily inspect all openpit working areas with any items of concern being reported to our senior managers our hydrology function measures and tracks water flow patterns to determine the effectiveness and need for dewatering and depressurization programs we drain all surface flows away from the open pit and pump any inpit surface water to dedicated drain holes connected to our underground dewatering drift system we also continuously monitor rainfall at our operations so that we may adjust for operational impacts and safety considerations 

grasberg openpit slippage 

on october 9 2003 a slippage of material occurred in a section of the grasberg open pit eight workers perished and five workers were injured in the incident the area affected by the slippage comprising approximately five percent of the surface area of the massive grasberg pit included two active mining areas that were scheduled to be mined in 2003 and 2004 on december 12 2003 a debris flow involving a relatively small amount of loose material occurred in the same area of the grasberg open pit resulting in only minor property damage following these two events pt freeport indonesia redirected its openpit operations to accelerate removal of waste material from the south wall to restore safe access to the highergrade ore areas in the pit these activities resulted in reduced production levels in april 2004 pt freeport indonesia established safe access and initiated mining in highergrade ore areas while continuing waste removal activities pt freeport indonesia resumed normal milling rates in june 2004 

as a result of the fourthquarter 2003 slippage and debris flow events pt freeport indonesia notified its copper concentrate customers that it was declaring force majeure under the terms of its contracts as it would be unable to satisfy its annual sales and delivery commitments in december 2004 pt freeport indonesia terminated the force majeure that had been in effect since december 2003 under its concentrate sales contracts 

pt freeport indonesia maintains property damage and business interruption insurance related to its operations in december 2004 we entered into an insurance settlement agreement and settled all claims that arose from the fourthquarter 2003 slippage and debris flow events in the grasberg openpit mine pt freeport indonesia ’s insurers agreed to pay an aggregate of 1250 million in connection with its claims after considering our joint venture partner ’s interest in the proceeds pt freeport indonesia ’s share of proceeds totaled 950 million 

exploration 

as a result of our joint venture arrangements rio tinto generally pays for 40 percent of our joint venture exploration and exploratory drilling costs in papua the joint ventures incurred total exploration costs of 133 million in 2005 and 136 million in 2004 the joint ventures’ exploration budget for 2006 including rio tinto’s share is expected to total approximately 15 million 10 million for our share with most of the effort focused on potential extensions of the grasberg underground and kucing liar mine complex and testing downward extensions of the previously mined ertsberg deposit we continue to assess the timing of resumption of suspended exploration activities in areas outside the existing producing area of the grasberg minerals district 

in june 1998 we entered into a joint venture agreement to conduct exploration activities in pt nabire bakti mining ’s contract of work area which currently covers approximately 500000 acres in several blocks contiguous to pt freeport indonesia ’s block b and one of eastern minerals’ blocks in papua rio tinto shares in 40 percent of our interest and costs in this exploration joint venture we and rio tinto can earn up to a 62 percent interest in the pt nabire bakti mining contract of work by spending up to 21 million on exploration and other activities in the joint venture areas we have spent 173 million through december 31 2005 

with the subsequent approval of the indonesian government in 2000 we suspended our field exploration activities in block b which includes the wabu ridge gold prospect as well as in the other contract of work areas of eastern minerals and pt nabire bakti mining the suspensions are due to safety and security issues and regulatory uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest areas and an indonesian forestry law enacted in 1999 prohibiting openpit mining in forest preservation areas all of the 

 

 

suspended areas are outside of our current mining operations area we continue to assess the possible timing for resumption of our exploration activities 

infrastructure 

the location of our mining operations in a remote area requires that our operations be virtually selfsufficient in addition to the mining facilities described above in the course of the development of our project we have constructed ourselves or participated with others in the construction of an airport a port a 119 kilometer road an aerial tramway two hospitals and related medical facilities and two town sites with housing schools and other facilities sufficient to support more than 17000 persons 

in 1996 we completed a significant infrastructure program which includes various residential community and commercial facilities we designed the program to provide the infrastructure needed for our operations to enhance the living conditions of our employees and to develop and promote the growth of local and other third party activities and enterprises in papua we have developed the facilities through joint ventures or direct ownership involving local indonesian interests and other investors 

in july 2003 we acquired the 857 percent ownership interest in puncakjaya power owned by affiliates of duke energy corporation for 681 million cash net of 99 million of cash acquired puncakjaya power is the owner of assets supplying power to pt freeport indonesia’s operations including the 3x65 megawatt coalfired power facilities pt freeport indonesia purchases power from puncakjaya power under infrastructure asset financing arrangements in march 2005 we prepaid 1870 million of bank debt associated with puncakjaya power’s operations and as a result of this prepayment of debt at december 31 2005 we had a 1354 million intercompany loan outstanding to puncakjaya power at december 31 2005 pt freeport indonesia had infrastructure asset financing obligations to puncakjaya power totaling 2181 million and puncakjaya power had a receivable from pt freeport indonesia for 2800 million including rio tinto’s share we consolidate pt freeport indonesia and puncakjaya power and our consolidated balance sheet only reflects a 619 million receivable 88 million in other accounts receivable and 531 million in longterm assets for rio tinto’s share of puncakjaya power’s receivable as provided for in our joint venture agreement with rio tinto 

marketing 

pt freeport indonesia sells its copper concentrates which contain significant quantities of gold and silver under us dollardenominated sales agreements mostly to companies in asia and europe and to international trading companies we sell substantially all of our budgeted production of copper concentrates under longterm contracts with selling prices based on world metals prices generally the london metal exchange settlement prices for grade a copper under these contracts initial billing occurs at the time of shipment and final settlement on the copper portion is generally based on average prices for a specified future period gold generally is sold at the average london bullion market association price for a specified month near the month of shipment 

revenues from concentrate sales are recorded net of royalties see “contracts of work” treatment and refining charges including participation charges if applicable based on the market prices of metals and the impact of derivative financial instruments if any used to hedge against risks from metals price fluctuations moreover because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrates is unrecoverable as a result of the smelting process our revenues from concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances based on the quantity and value of these unrecoverable metals these allowances are a negotiated term of our contracts and vary by customer treatment and refining charges represent payments to smelters and refiners and are either fixed or in certain cases vary with the price of copper we sell a small amount of copper concentrates in the spot market see “risk factors” 

we have commitments including commitments from atlantic copper and pt smelting for essentially all of pt freeport indonesia’s estimated 2006 production pt freeport indonesia has a longterm contract through 2007 to provide atlantic copper with a quantity of copper concentrates at market prices which currently approximates 60 percent of atlantic copper ’s annual copper concentrate requirements pt freeport indonesia ’s agreement with pt smelting provides for the life of pt freeport indonesia ’s mines for the supply of 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements necessary to produce 205000 metric tons of copper essentially the gresik smelter ’s original design capacity on a priority basis in 2004 pt smelting increased its stated production capacity to 250000 metric tons of copper per year pt smelting plans to expand its production capacity to approximately 270000 metric tons of copper metal per year by the middle of 2006 for the first 15 years of pt smelting ’s commercial operations beginning december 1998 pt freeport indonesia agreed that the treatment and refining 

 

 

charges on specified quantities of the concentrate pt freeport indonesia supplies will not fall below specified minimum rates subject to renegotiation in 2008 the rate was 023 per pound during the period from the commencement of pt smelting ’s operations in 1998 until april 3 2004 when it declined to a minimum of 021 per pound we anticipate that pt freeport indonesia will sell approximately 50 to 60 percent of its annual concentrate production to atlantic copper and pt smelting a summary of pt freeport indonesia ’s aggregate percentage concentrate sales to its affiliates and to other parties for the last three years follows 

 

investment in smelters 

our investment in smelters atlantic copper and pt smelting serves an important role in our concentrate marketing strategy as discussed above pt freeport indonesia generally sells approximately onehalf of its concentrate production to its affiliated smelters atlantic copper and pt smelting and the remainder to other customers treatment charges for smelting and refining copper concentrates represent a cost to pt freeport indonesia and income to atlantic copper and pt smelting through downstream integration we are assured placement of a significant portion of our concentrate production while low smelting and refining charges in recent years adversely affected the operating results of atlantic copper they benefited the operating results of pt freeport indonesia ’s mining operations effectively achieving a hedge for these charges market rates for treatment and refining charges have increased significantly since late 2004 higher treatment and refining charges benefit the operating results of atlantic copper and adversely affect the operating results of pt freeport indonesia however the net effect of changes in treatment and refining rates on our consolidated results is not material 

atlantic copper sa we own 100 percent of atlantic copper atlantic copper completed the last expansion of its production capacity in 1997 and its smelter currently has a nominal capacity of 290000 metric tons of copper per year and its refinery currently has a design capacity of 260000 metric tons of copper per year we have no present plans to expand atlantic copper ’s production capacity during 2005 atlantic copper treated 975400 metric tons of concentrate and scrap and produced 284200 metric tons of new copper anodes during 2004 atlantic copper treated 768100 metric tons of concentrate and scrap and produced 224300 metric tons of new copper anodes atlantic copper’s positive results in 2005 compared with 2004 primarily reflect higher treatment charge rates and realized benefits from a recent cost reduction and operational enhancement effort partially offset by higher energy costs atlantic copper completed a 51day scheduled major maintenance turnaround in may 2004 adversely affecting 2004 results major maintenance turnarounds of this duration typically occur approximately every nine years for atlantic copper with significantly shorterterm maintenance turnarounds occurring in the interim atlantic copper has a 22day maintenance turnaround currently scheduled for 2007 atlantic copper purchased approximately 55 percent of its 2005 concentrate requirements from pt freeport indonesia at market prices atlantic copper has experienced no material operating problems and we are not aware of any potential material environmental liabilities at atlantic copper 

we made no capital contributions to atlantic copper in 2005 however we contributed 2020 million to atlantic copper in 2004 and 100 million in 2003 in addition we loaned 1895 million to atlantic copper in 2004 the funds were used to improve atlantic copper ’s financial structure during its major maintenance turnaround and during a period of extremely low treatment and refining charge rates which negatively affected atlantic copper ’s results our net investment in atlantic copper through december 31 2005 was 1150 million 

pt smelting pt freeport indonesia ’s contract of work required us to construct or cause to be constructed a smelter in indonesia if we and the indonesian government determined that such a project would be economically viable in 1995 following the completion of a feasibility study we entered into agreements relating to the formation of pt smelting and the construction of the copper smelter in gresik indonesia 

pt smelting is a joint venture among pt freeport indonesia mitsubishi materials corporation mitsubishi corporation and nippon mining  metals co ltd which own 25 percent 605 percent 95 percent and 5 percent respectively of the outstanding pt smelting common stock in accordance with the joint venture agreements pt freeport indonesia provides the majority of pt smelting ’s copper concentrate requirements in december 2003 pt smelting ’s shareholder agreement was amended to eliminate pt freeport indonesia ’s assignment of its earnings in 

 

 

pt smelting to support a 13 percent cumulative annual return to the other owners for the first 20 years of operations no amounts were paid under this assignment pt freeport indonesia ’s total investment in pt smelting through december 31 2005 was 987 million 

during 2005 pt smelting treated 908900 metric tons of concentrate and produced 275000 metric tons of new copper anodes during 2004 pt smelting treated 758100 metric tons of concentrate and produced 211600 metric tons of new copper anodes pt smelting completed a 31day major maintenance turnaround in the second quarter of 2004 major maintenance turnarounds of this duration typically occur approximately every four years for pt smelting with significantly shorter term maintenance turnarounds in the interim pt smelting has an 18day maintenance turnaround scheduled for mid2006 and its next major maintenance turnaround is scheduled for 2008 pt smelting also completed a refinery expansion during the maintenance turnaround increasing its production capacity to approximately 250000 metric tons of copper metal per year pt smelting plans to further expand its production capacity to approximately 270000 metric tons of copper metal per year by the middle of 2006 pt smelting has experienced no material operating problems and we are not aware of any potential material environmental liabilities at pt smelting 

competition 

we compete with other mining companies in the sale of our mineral concentrates and the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel some competing companies possess financial resources greater than ours and possess multiple mining assets less geographically concentrated in a single area than ours we believe however that we are one of the lowestcost copper producers in the world after taking into account credits for related gold and silver production which gives us a significant competitive advantage 

social development employment and human rights 

we have a social employment and human rights policy designed to result in our operating in compliance with the laws in the areas of our operations and in a manner that respects basic human rights and the culture of the people who are indigenous to the area we continue to make significant expenditures on social and cultural activities primarily in papua these activities include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in 1996 pt freeport indonesia agreed to commit at least one percent of its revenues to the freeport partnership fund for community development formerly the freeport fund for irian jaya development to support villagebased health education economic and social development programs in its area of operations this commitment replaced our community development programs in which we spent a similar amount of money each year our share of contributions to the freeport partnership fund for community development totaled 357 million in 2005 175 million in 2004 and 174 million in 2003 our joint venture partner rio tinto also contributes to this fund and including their share the contributions totaled 423 million in 2005 190 million in 2004 and 215 million in 2003 

lembaga pembangunan masyarakat amungme kamoro lpmak oversees disbursement of the amounts we contribute to the fund lpmak ’s board of commissioners is made up of a leader of the amungme people a leader of the kamoro people leaders of the three local churches a representative of the local government and a representative of pt freeport indonesia 

we believe that our social and economic development programs are responsive to the issues raised by the local villages and people and should help us to avoid disruptions of mining operations nevertheless social and political instability in the area may adversely impact our mining operations see “risk factors” 

in december 2000 we endorsed the joint us state departmentbritish foreign office voluntary principles on human rights and security several major natural resources companies and international human rights 

 

 

organizations participated in developing the voluntary principles and have endorsed them we participated in developing these principles and incorporated them into our social and human rights policy 

security matters 

consistent with our contract of work and the requirement to protect our employees and property we have taken appropriate steps to provide a safe and secure working environment as part of its security program pt freeport indonesia maintains its own internal security department which performs functions such as protecting company facilities monitoring the shipment of company goods through the airport and terminal assisting in traffic control and aiding rescue operations pt freeport indonesia ’s civilian security employees numbering about 680 are unarmed and perform duties consistent with their internal security role pt freeport indonesia ’s share of costs for its internal civilian security department totaled 113 million for 2005 123 million for 2004 and 112 million for 2003 the security department has received human rights training and each member is required to certify his or her compliance with our human rights policy 

pt freeport indonesia and all businesses and residents of indonesia relies on the government of indonesia for the provision of public order upholding the rule of law and the protection of personnel and property the grasberg mine has been designated by the government of indonesia as one of indonesia ’s vital national assets this designation results in the military ’s playing a significant role in protecting the area of our operations the government of indonesia is responsible for employing police and military personnel and directing their operations 

from the outset of pt freeport indonesia ’s operations the government has looked to pt freeport indonesia to provide logistical and infrastructure support and assistance for these necessary services because of the limited resources of the indonesian government and the remote location of and lack of development in papua pt freeport indonesia ’s financial support for the indonesian government security institutions assigned to the operations area represents a prudent response to its requirements to protect its workforce and property better ensuring that personnel are properly fed and lodged and have the logistical resources to patrol pt freeport indonesia ’s roads and secure its operating area in addition provision of such support and oversight is consistent with pt freeport indonesia ’s obligations under the contract of work reflects our philosophy of responsible corporate citizenship and is in keeping with our commitment to pursue practices that will promote human rights which include our endorsement of the joint us state departmentbritish foreign office voluntary principles on human rights and security 

pt freeport indonesia ’s share of support costs for the governmentprovided security involving over 2400 indonesian government security personnel currently located in the general area of our operations was 62 million for 2005 69 million for 2004 and 59 million for 2003 this supplemental support consists of various infrastructure and other costs such as food housing fuel travel vehicle repairs allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs and community assistance programs conducted by the militarypolice pt freeport indonesia ’s capital costs for associated infrastructure was 01 million for 2005 02 million for 2004 and 06 million for 2003 

as reported in january 2006 we are responding to requests from governmental authorities in the united states and indonesia for information about pt freeport indonesia primarily relating to pt freeport indonesias support of indonesian security institutions as discussed above we provide support to assist security institutions deployed and directed by the government of indonesia with infrastructure logistics and the hardship elements of posting in papua and our practices adhere to the joint us state departmentbritish foreign office voluntary principles on security and human rights we intend to cooperate in responding to these requests 

environmental matters 

we have a boardapproved environmental policy that commits us not only to compliance with applicable federal state and local environmental statutes and regulations but also to continuous improvement of our environmental performance at every operational site we believe that we conduct our indonesian operations pursuant to all necessary permits and are in compliance in all material respects with applicable indonesian environmental laws rules and regulations additionally the environmental management systems for our pt freeport indonesia mining and milling operations and our atlantic copper smelting operations are iso international standardization organization 14001 certified 

mining operations on the scale of our operations in papua involve significant environmental challenges primarily related to the disposition of tailings which are the crushed and ground rock material resulting from the physical separation of commercially valuable minerals from the ore we have comprehensive ongoing environmental 

 

 

management and monitoring plans for the disposal of tailings resulting from our milling operations which the government of indonesia has approved pursuant to these plans we manage and monitor the impact of our tailings disposal on the surrounding area of the ajkwa river and adjoining water bodies and the surrounding coastal areas in 1997 we completed an engineered levee system to minimize the impact of the tailings through a controlled deposition area located on a portion of the flood plain on the ajkwa river 

in furtherance of our commitments to the indonesian government pursuant to our tailings management plan we monitor the acidneutralizing capacity of tailings on a daily basis to ensure the discharge of nonacid generating tailings into our tailings deposition area the net acidneutralizing capacity of our tailings discharge is maintained through a managed program of blending underground ore with ore from the open pit the addition of supplemental limestone or lime to the ore blend and the addition of lime for control of the ph levels in the flotation system daily samples are collected and tested and this data is communicated to our mill operations so that adjustments in ore blending and limelimestone addition can be made as appropriate 

with respect to overburden control and treatment of acid rock drainage is our primary environmental issue our approaches to this issue include the prevention of acid rock drainage generation the control of acid rock drainage migration and the capture and treatment of acid rock drainage emanating from the overburden stockpile in addition tests have shown the feasibility of revegetating the overburden stockpile and as a result we have engaged in stockpile reclamation as an additional means of mitigating acid rock drainage 

we have made significant capital expenditures with respect to the capture and treatment of acid rock drainage we continue to evaluate various technologies for the treatment of captured acid rock drainage currently acid rock drainage collected by boreholes at the base of the overburden stockpile is treated using conventional lime neutralization 

we have also committed to the indonesian government to have independent external environmental audits of our papuan operations performed by qualified experts every three years with results available for public review we have had four independent environmental audits conducted by internationally recognized consulting and auditing firms montgomery watson harza has completed the fieldwork for the 2005 external environmental audit and we expect the audit report to be completed by early in the second quarter of 2006 we conduct annual internal audits to ensure that our environmental management and monitoring programs remain sound and our operations will continue to comply in all material respects with applicable regulations 

in connection with obtaining our environmental approvals from the indonesian government we committed to performing a onetime environmental risk assessment on the impacts of our tailings management plan we completed this extensive environmental risk assessment with more than 90 scientific studies conducted over four years and submitted it to the indonesian government in december 2002 we developed the risk assessment exercise with input from an independent review panel which included representatives from the indonesian government academia and nongovernmental organizations the risks that we identified during this process were in line with our impact projections of the tailings management program contained in our environmental approval documents 

we have environmental approvals from the government of indonesia to expand our milling rate up to a maximum of 300000 metric tons of ore per day in 2005 we averaged 216200 metric tons of ore per day and in 2004 we averaged 185100 metric tons of ore per day 

the cost of complying with environmental laws is a fundamental cost of our business we incurred aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs totaling 440 million in 2005 651 million in 2004 and 721 million in 2003 including tailings management levee maintenance and mine reclamation in 2006 we expect to incur approximately 28 million of aggregate environmental capital expenditures and 37 million of other environmental costs 

we are currently revegetating portions of the tailings deposition area upon the completion of our mining operations we will fulfill the commitments included in our approved environmental management plans our plans for revegetation of affected areas of the deposition area include natural revegetation forage crops and grasses fruits grains and vegetables and other traditional food and medicinal crops decisions on these plans are made in consultation with local and regional government local residents and other stakeholders in addition to the revegetation and reclamation of the deposition area we will continue to operate treatment systems as long as necessary we also monitor and test the water discharged from our mine and the ph sulfate and electrical conductivity levels of ground water in the deposition area the stability of our levees will be ensured through 

 

 

comprehensive visual inspection maintenance and improvement programs directed by an experienced engineering group dedicated to levee management and revegetation of the levee embankments moreover we will submit an annual written report to the indonesian government regarding our reclamation activities 

our ultimate reclamation and closure activities will be determined after consultation with the indonesian government local residents and other parties our estimate as of december 31 2005 of pt freeport indonesia ’s total aggregate reclamation and closure obligations total approximately 156 million estimates of reclamation and closure costs involve complex issues requiring integrated assessments over a period of many years and we may revise them as we perform more complete studies some reclamation costs will be incurred during mining activities while most closure costs and the remaining reclamation costs will be incurred at the end of mining activities which are currently estimated to continue for more than 35 years 

moreover we cannot predict with any certainty the ultimate future uses of the tailings deposition area once our mining operations are completed in addition to forage crop and grass planting and food and medicinal crop production possible future uses of the tailings deposition area include rainforest regrowth production of timber fuel woods fruits and nuts and other economic forestry and the cultivation of fish shellfish and other aquaculture the ultimate future uses will be determined in consultation with local and regional government local residents and other stakeholders 

in 1996 we began contributing to a cash fund 72 million balance at december 31 2005 designed to accumulate at least 100 million by the end of our indonesian mining activities we plan to use this fund including accrued interest to pay for mine closure and reclamation costs any incremental costs in excess of this 100 million fund are expected to be incurred throughout the life of the mine and would be funded by operational cash flow or other sources future environmental considerations and future changes in regulations could require us to incur additional costs that would be charged against future operations estimates involving environmental matters are by their nature imprecise and changes in government regulations operations technology and inflation can be expected to require us to revise them over time 

we believe that atlantic copper ’s facilities and operations are in compliance in all material respects with all currently applicable spanish environmental laws rules and regulations in july 2002 the integrated pollution prevention and control guidelines were adopted under spanish law with a phase in for compliance by 2009 atlantic copper working with local environmental authorities is continually assessing the impact of these new guidelines on its operations and has budgeted approximately 20 million as its estimate of the remaining required capital expenditures from 2006 through 2009 to comply in april 2005 the environmental management systems at atlantic copper’s operations in huelva were audited by the spanish association for standardization and certification aenor in accordance with the iso 1400196 international certification standards and the european union environmental ecomanagement and ecoauditing emas regulation no 7612001 aenor is a spanish notforprofit entity that has been accredited by the spanish government to inspect audit and certify environmental management systems atlantic copper received positive results from the audits which are required annually to retain the iso 14001 certification that atlantic copper achieved in prior years 

the indonesian and spanish governments may periodically revise their environmental laws and regulations or adopt new ones and we cannot predict the effects on our operations of new or revised regulations we have expended significant resources both financial and managerial to comply with environmental regulations and permitting and approval requirements and we anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future there can be no assurance that we will not incur additional significant costs and liabilities to comply with such current and future regulations or that such regulations will not materially affect our operations see “risk factors” 

employees and relationship with fm services company 

as of december 31 2005 pt freeport indonesia had 8044 employees approximately 98 percent indonesian and 6225 contract workers the vast majority of whom were indonesian approximately 75 percent of pt freeport indonesia ’s employees are represented by the all indonesia workers’ union which operates under government of indonesia supervision pt freeport indonesia has a labor agreement covering its hourly paid indonesian employees the key provisions of which are renegotiated biannually in june 2005 pt freeport indonesia and its workers agreed to terms for a new labor agreement that expires in september 2007 pt freeport indonesia’s relations with the workers’ union have generally been satisfactory in addition 4475 persons worked for privatized companies providing services within pt freeport indonesia ’s operations area 

 

as of december 31 2005 atlantic copper had 544 employees of which approximately 72 percent are represented by union contracts atlantic copper’s labor contract covering its smelterrefinery workforce in huelva spain expired on december 31 2005 and was renewed for a threeyear period with no material changes in terms atlantic copper experienced a fourday labor strike in october 2004 at its smelter facility in huelva because of a workforce reduction plan the union’s issues with the workforce reduction plan were resolved and the plan was approved by spanish authorities and implemented in december 2004

 item 1a risk factors 

this report contains “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws forwardlooking statements are all statements other than statements of historical facts such as statements regarding anticipated production volumes unit net cash costs sales volumes ore grades commodity prices development and capital expenditures mine production and development plans environmental reclamation and closure cost and plans reserve estimates political economic and social conditions in our areas of operations and exploration efforts and results except for our ongoing obligations under the federal securities laws we do not intend and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements readers are cautioned that forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially from those projected anticipated or assumed in the forwardlooking statements important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements include the following 

because our primary operating assets are located in the republic of indonesia our business may be adversely affected by indonesian political economic and social uncertainties in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in a foreign country 

indonesia has faced political economic and social uncertainties including separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces in particular several separatist groups are opposing indonesian rule over the province of papua where our mining operations are located and have sought political independence for the province in response to demands for political independence new indonesian regional autonomy laws became effective january 1 2001 however the manner in which the new laws are being implemented and the degree of political and economic autonomy that they may bring to individual provinces including papua is uncertain and is an ongoing issue in indonesian politics moreover in papua there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the indonesian military social economic and political instability in papua could materially and adversely affect us if this instability results in damage to our property or interruption of our activities 

maintaining a good working relationship with the indonesian government is important to us because all of our mining operations are located in indonesia and are conducted pursuant to contracts of work with the indonesian government accordingly we are also subject to the usual risks associated with conducting business in and with a foreign country including the risk of forced modification of existing contracts changes in the country ’s laws and policies including those relating to taxation royalties divestment imports exports and currency and the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel or having to enforce the judgment of a foreign court or arbitration panel against a sovereign nation within its own territory in addition we are subject to the risk of expropriation and our insurance does not cover losses caused by expropriation 

in february 2006 a group of illegal gold panners engaged in conflict with indonesian police and pt freeport indonesia security personnel when they were requested to leave an area near our milling facilities following the incident the illegal panners blocked the road leading to the grasberg mine and mill in protest and we temporarily suspended mining and milling operations as a precautionary measure the panners also vandalized some of our light vehicles and offices near this area causing approximately 4 million in damages our port facilities continued to operate during the disruption and concentrate shipments were not affected the panners mostly papuans from outside our area of operations presented a list of aspirations primarily relating to their desire to share in the benefits 

 

 

of our existing initiatives and programs provided for the papuans who are the traditional residents of our operations area mining and milling operations resumed after an approximate fourday outage during the incident at our mine and mill protestors in jakarta vandalized the entrance floor of the office building housing our indonesian headquarters and staged a threeday rally outside the building the indonesian police handled this matter which did not disrupt our administrative functions or damage any of our facilities 

we cannot predict if there will be additional incidents similar to the february 2006 protests if there were additional protests at our mine and mill facilities it could materially and adversely affect our business and profitability in ways that we cannot predict at this time 

 

in addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry we face additional risks because our operations are located on difficult terrain in a very remote area 

our mining operations are located in steeply mountainous terrain in a very remote area in indonesia because of these conditions we have had to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities in addition the area receives considerable rainfall which has led to periodic floods and mudslides the mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time in addition to these special risks we are also subject to the usual risks associated with the mining industry such as the risk of encountering unexpected geological conditions that may result in caveins and flooding of mine areas our insurance may not sufficiently cover an unexpected natural or operating disaster 

on october 9 2003 a slippage of material occurred in a section of the grasberg open pit resulting in eight fatalities on december 12 2003 a debris flow involving a relatively small amount of loose material occurred in the same section of the open pit resulting in only minor property damage all material involved in the affected mining areas was removed the events caused us to alter our shortterm mine sequencing plans which adversely affected our 2003 and 2004 production while we resumed normal production activities in the second quarter of 2004 no assurance can be given that similar events will not occur in the future 

the terrorist attacks in the united states on september 11 2001 subsequent attacks in indonesia and the potential for additional future terrorist acts and other recent events have created economic and political uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business and the prices of our securities 

on august 31 2002 three people were killed and 11 others were wounded in an ambush by a group of unidentified assailants the assailants shot at several vehicles transporting international contract teachers from our school in tembagapura their family members and other contractors to pt freeport indonesia on the road near tembagapura the mining town where the majority of pt freeport indonesia ’s personnel reside we along with the us government the central indonesian government the papuan provincial and local governments and leaders of the local people residing in the area of our operations condemned the attack indonesian authorities and the us fbi investigated the incident which resulted in the us indictment of an alleged operational commander of the free papua movementnational freedom force in january 2006 indonesian police accompanied by fbi agents arrested the alleged operational commander in the free papua movementnational freedom force and 11 other papuans 

on october 12 2002 a bombing killed 202 people in the indonesian province of bali which is 1500 miles west of our mining and milling operations indonesian authorities arrested 35 people in connection with this bombing and 29 of those arrested have been tried and convicted on august 5 2003 12 people were killed and over 100 others were injured by a car bomb detonated outside of the jw marriott hotel in jakarta indonesia on september 9 2004 11 people were killed and over 200 others injured by a car bomb detonated in front of the australian embassy in jakarta on october 1 2005 three suicide bombers killed 19 people and wounded over 100 others in bali the same international terrorist organizations are suspected in each of these incidents in november 2005 indonesian police raided a house in east java that resulted in the death of other accused terrorists linked to the bombings discussed above our mining and milling operations were not interrupted by these incidents but our corporate office in jakarta had to relocate for several months following the bombing in front of the australian embassy 

we cannot predict whether there will be additional incidents similar to the recent shooting or bombings if there were to be additional separatist terrorist or other violence in indonesia it could materially and adversely affect our business and profitability in ways that we cannot predict at this time 

 

terrorist attacks and other recent events have caused uncertainty in the world ’s financial and insurance markets and may significantly increase global political economic and social instability including in indonesia in addition to the bali jw marriott hotel and australian embassy bombings there have been antiamerican demonstrations in certain sections of indonesia reportedly led by radical islamic activists radical activists have also threatened to attack foreign interests and have called for the expulsion of us and british citizens and companies from indonesia 

it is possible that further acts of terrorism may be directed against the us domestically or abroad and such acts could be directed against properties and personnel of companies such as ours the attacks and the resulting economic and political uncertainties including the potential for further terrorist acts have negatively impacted insurance markets moreover while our property and business interruption insurance covers damages to insured property directly caused by terrorism this insurance does not cover damages and losses caused by war terrorism and war developments may materially and adversely affect our business and profitability and the prices of our securities in ways that we cannot predict at this time 

our profitability can vary significantly with fluctuations in the market prices of copper and gold 

our revenues are derived primarily from the sale of copper concentrates which also contain significant quantities of gold and silver and from the sale of copper cathodes and anodes although we sell most of our copper concentrates under longterm contracts the selling price is based on world metal prices at or near the time of shipment and delivery 

during 2005 the daily closing prices on the london spot market ranged from 139 to 211 per pound for copper and 411 to 538 per ounce for gold during 2004 the daily closing prices on the london spot market ranged from 106 to 149 per pound for copper and 374 to 456 per ounce for gold 

world copper prices have historically fluctuated widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control including 

 

 

 

 

 

world gold prices also have historically fluctuated widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any material decrease in market prices of copper or gold would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition see our 2005 annual report incorporated herein by reference for an analysis of the effect on our revenues and net income of changes in copper and gold prices 

our contracts of work are subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations and if a dispute arises we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel 

pt freeport indonesia ’s contracts of work and other contracts of work in which we have an interest were entered into under indonesia ’s 1967 foreign capital investment law which provides guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization our contracts of work can be terminated by the government of indonesia if we do not satisfy our contractual obligations which include the payment of royalties and taxes to the government and the satisfaction of certain mining environmental safety and health requirements indonesian government officials have periodically raised questions regarding our compliance with indonesian environmental laws and regulations and the terms of the contracts of work in order to address these questions the indonesian government formed a factfinding team in 2000 that reviewed our compliance with all aspects of pt freeport indonesia ’s contract of work we cannot assure you that if and when the indonesian government ’s report is released the report will conclude that we are complying with all of the provisions of pt freeport indonesia ’s contract of work 

moreover at times certain government officials and others in indonesia have questioned the validity of contracts entered into by the government of indonesia prior to may 1998  ie  during the suharto regime including pt freeport indonesia ’s contract of work which was signed in december 1991 we cannot assure you that the validity of or our compliance with the contracts of work will not be challenged for political or other reasons pt freeport indonesia ’s contracts of work and our other contracts of work require that disputes with the indonesian government be submitted to international arbitration notwithstanding that provision if a dispute arises under the contracts of work we face the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel and if we prevail in such a dispute we will face the additional risk of having to enforce the judgment of a foreign court or arbitration panel against indonesia within its own territory 

any suspension of required activities under our contracts of work requires the consent of the indonesian government 

our contracts of work permit us to suspend certain contractually required activities including exploration for a period of one year by making a written request to the indonesian government these requests are subject to the approval of the indonesian government and are renewable annually if we do not request a suspension or are denied a suspension then we are required to continue our activities under the contract of work or potentially be declared in default moreover if a suspension continues for more than one year for reasons other than force majeure and the indonesian government has not approved such continuation then the government would be entitled to declare a default under the contract of work 

we suspended our field exploration activities outside of block a in recent years due to safety and security issues and regulatory uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest areas and an indonesian forestry law enacted in 1999 prohibiting openpit mining in forest preservation areas in 2001 we requested and received from the government of indonesia formal temporary suspensions of our obligations under the contracts of work in all areas outside of block a recent indonesian legislation permits openpit mining in pt freeport indonesia ’s block b area subject to certain requirements we continue to assess these requirements and security issues the timing for the resumption of exploration activities in our contract of work areas outside of block a depends on the resolution of these matters 

our mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges and future changes in environmental laws or unanticipated environmental impacts from our operations could require us to incur increased costs 

mining operations on the scale of our operations in papua involve significant environmental risks and challenges our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of crushed and ground rock material called tailings that results from the process by which we physically separate the copper gold and silverbearing materials from the ore that we mine our tailings management plan uses the river system near our mine to transport the tailings to the lowlands where the tailings and natural sediments are deposited in a controlled area contained within a levee system 

 

 

that will be revegetated we incurred aggregate costs relating to tailings management of 87 million in 2005 118 million in 2004 and 83 million in 2003 

another major environmental challenge is managing overburden which is the rock that must be moved aside in the mining process in order to reach the ore in the presence of air water and naturally occurring bacteria some overburden can cause acid rock drainage or acidic water containing dissolved metals which if not properly managed can have a negative impact on the environment 

certain indonesian governmental officials have from time to time raised issues with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans including a suggestion that we implement a pipeline system rather than our river deposition system for tailings disposal because our mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area a pipeline system would be costly difficult to construct and maintain more prone to catastrophic failure and involve environmental issues an external panel of qualified experts as directed in our 300k andal the environmental impact assessment document submitted to the indonesian government conducted detailed reviews and analyses of a number of technical studies they concluded that all significant impacts identified were in line with the 300k andal predictions and that the current system of riverine tailings management was appropriate considering all sitespecific factors for these reasons we do not believe that a pipeline system is necessary or practical 

 

we anticipate that we will continue to spend significant financial and managerial resources on environmental compliance in addition changes in indonesian environmental laws or unanticipated environmental impacts from our operations could require us to incur significant unanticipated costs 

the volume and grade of the reserves we recover and our rates of production may be more or less than we anticipate 

our reserve amounts are determined in accordance with established mining industry practices and standards but are estimates of the mineral deposits that can be recovered economically and legally based on currently available data our ore bodies may not conform to standard geological expectations and estimates may change as new data become available because ore bodies do not contain uniform grades of minerals our metal recovery rates will vary from time to time which will result in variations in the volumes of minerals that we can sell from period to period some of our reserves may become unprofitable to develop if there are unfavorable longterm market price fluctuations in copper and gold or if there are significant increases in our operating or capital costs in addition our exploration programs may not result in the discovery of additional mineral deposits that we can mine profitably 

we do not expect to mine all of our reserves before the initial term of our contract of work expires 

all of our current proven and probable reserves including the grasberg deposit are located in block a the initial term of our contract of work covering these reserves expires at the end of 2021 we can extend this term for two successive 10year periods subject to the approval of the indonesian government which under our contract of work cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably our reserves reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041  ie  through the expiration of the two 10year extensions and our current mine plan has been developed and our operations are based on the assumption that we will receive the two 10year extensions as a result we will not mine all of our reserves during the current term of our contract of work and there can be no assurance that the indonesian government will approve the extensions prior to the end of 2021 we expect to mine approximately 44 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable ore at december 31 2005 representing approximately 52 percent of pt freeport indonesia ’s share of recoverable copper reserves and approximately 65 percent of its share of recoverable gold reserves 

servicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors some of which are beyond our control 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our maturing debt depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow this ability to a significant extent is subject to commodity prices and general economic financial regulatory political and other factors that are beyond our control in addition our ability to borrow funds in the future to service our debt will depend on meeting the financial covenants in our 10⅛ senior notes due 2010 our 6⅞ senior notes due 2014 our bank credit facilities and other debt agreements we may have in the future future borrowings may not be available to us under our bank credit facilities or from the capital markets in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund other liquidity needs as a result we may 

 

 

need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our debt on favorable terms could materially and adversely affect our financial condition 

covenants in our bank credit facilities impose restrictions on us 

although we currently have no amounts outstanding under our bank credit facilities our bank credit facilities 

 

 

·   incur additional indebtedness 

·   make investments 

·   engage in transactions with affiliates 

·   create liens on our assets and 

 

events beyond our control including changes in general economic and business conditions may affect our ability to satisfy these covenants which could result in a default if an event of default occurs the banks could declare any amounts outstanding together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable an event of default under our bank credit facilities may also give rise to an event of default under our other existing and future debt agreements 

covenants in our 10⅛ senior notes due 2010 and 6⅞ senior notes due 2014 also impose restrictions on us 

our 10⅛ senior notes and our 6⅞ senior notes limit among other things our ability to 

 

 

 

 

 

movements in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates could negatively affect our operating results 

all of our revenues and a significant portion of our costs are denominated in us dollars however some costs and certain asset and liability accounts are denominated in indonesian rupiah australian dollars or euros as a result we are generally less profitable when the us dollar weakens in relation to these foreign currencies 

the rupiahus dollar daily closing exchange rate ranged from 9142 to 10753 rupiah per us dollar during 2005 and on december 30 2005 the closing exchange rate was 9825 rupiah per us dollar compared with 9270 rupiah per us dollar on december 31 2004 during 2005 the australian dollarus dollar daily closing exchange rate ranged from 072 to 080 per australian dollar and the eurous dollar daily closing exchange rate ranged from 116 to 136 per euro on december 30 2005 the closing exchange rates were 073 per australian dollar and 118 per euro compared with the december 31 2004 closing exchange rates of 078 per australian dollar and 136 per euro 

from time to time we have in the past and may in the future implement currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates however our hedging strategies may not be successful and any of our unhedged foreign exchange payment requirements will continue to be subject to market fluctuations 

 

 

in addition our bank credit facilities are based on fluctuating interest rates accordingly an increase in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

because we are a holding company our ability to pay our debts depends upon the ability of our subsidiaries to pay us dividends and to advance us funds in addition our ability to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries’ assets is generally subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries’ creditors 

because we conduct business primarily through pt freeport indonesia our major subsidiary and other subsidiaries our ability to pay our debts depends upon the earnings and cash flow of pt freeport indonesia and our other subsidiaries and their ability to pay us dividends and to advance us funds contractual and legal restrictions applicable to our subsidiaries could also limit our ability to obtain cash from them our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries’ assets upon their liquidation reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries’ creditors including any trade creditors and preferred shareholders

we have one of the world ’s largest copper and gold mining and production operations in terms of reserves and production we are also one of the lowestcost copper producers in the world after taking into account credits for related gold and silver production our principal asset is the grasberg minerals district we discovered the largest ore body in the district grasberg in 1988 the grasberg minerals district contains the largest single gold reserve and the secondlargest copper reserves of any mine in the world 

 

our principal operating subsidiary is pt freeport indonesia a limited liability company organized under the laws of the republic of indonesia and incorporated as a corporation in delaware we own approximately 9064 percent of pt freeport indonesia and the government of indonesia owns the remaining approximate 936 percent pt freeport indonesia mines processes and explores for ore containing copper gold and silver it operates in the remote highlands of the sudirman mountain range in the province of papua indonesia which is on the western half of the island of new guinea pt freeport indonesia markets its concentrates containing copper gold and silver worldwide 

pt freeport indonesia conducts its operations pursuant to an agreement called a contract of work with the government of indonesia see “contracts of work” the contract of work allows us to conduct extensive mining production and exploration activities in a 24700acre area that we call block a which contains the grasberg minerals district and governs our rights and obligations relating to taxes exchange controls royalties repatriation and other matters the contract of work also allows us to explore for minerals in an approximately 500000acre area that we call block b exploration activities in block b have been suspended in recent years but we are currently assessing the possible timing for the resumption of those activities see “contracts of work” the term of our contract of work expires in 2021 but we can extend it for two 10year periods subject to indonesian government approval which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably 

another of our operating subsidiaries pt irja eastern minerals which we refer to as eastern minerals holds an additional contract of work in papua covering approximately 12 million acres and conducts exploration activities which have been suspended in recent years under this contract of work see “contracts of work” we are assessing the possible timing for the resumption of exploration activities in eastern minerals’ exploration area we have a 100 percent ownership interest in eastern minerals 

in 1996 we established joint ventures with rio tinto plc which is an international mining company with headquarters in london england rio tinto conducts mining operations in north america south america asia australia europe and southern africa one of our joint ventures with rio tinto covers pt freeport indonesia ’s mining operations in block a this joint venture gives rio tinto through 2021 a 40 percent interest in certain assets and in production above specified levels from operations in block a and after 2021 a 40 percent interest in all production in block a under our joint venture arrangements rio tinto also has a 40 percent interest in pt freeport indonesia ’s contract of work and eastern minerals ’ contract of work in addition rio tinto has the option to participate in 40 percent of any of our other future exploration projects in papua to date rio tinto has elected to participate in all exploration projects including pt nabire bakti mining 

under another joint venture agreement through pt nabire bakti mining we conduct exploration activities which have been suspended in recent years see “contracts of work” in an area covering approximately 500000 acres in five parcels contiguous to pt freeport indonesia ’s block b and one of eastern minerals ’ blocks we are assessing the possible timing for the resumption of exploration activities in pt nabire bakti mining ’s exploration area 

at december 31 2004 pt freeport indonesia ’s share of proven and probable recoverable reserves totaled 405 billion pounds of copper and 465 million ounces of gold all of which are located in block a our approximate 9064 percent equity share of these proven and probable recoverable reserves totaled 367 billion pounds of copper and 421 million ounces of gold see “ore reserves” in this annual report we refer to 1 aggregate reserves which means all reserves for the operations we manage 2 pt freeport indonesia ’s share of reserves which means the reserves net of rio tinto ’s interest under our joint venture arrangements and which are the reserves reported as those of our operations in our consolidated financial statements and 3 our equity share of reserves which means pt freeport indonesia ’s share net of the 936 percent interest that the government of indonesia owns 

 

in july 2003 we acquired the 857 percent ownership interest in pt puncakjaya power owned by affiliates of duke energy corporation puncakjaya power is the owner of assets supplying power to pt freeport indonesia ’s operations including the 3x65 megawatt coalfired power facilities see “infrastructure” 

we also smelt and refine copper concentrates in spain and market the refined copper products through our wholly owned subsidiary atlantic copper sa in addition pt freeport indonesia has a 25 percent interest in pt smelting an indonesian company that operates a copper smelter and refinery in gresik indonesia these smelters play an important role in our concentrate marketing strategy as approximately onehalf of pt freeport indonesia ’s concentrate production has been sold to atlantic copper and pt smelting over the last several years see “investment in smelters”

contracts of work 

by virtue of their contracts of work pt freeport indonesia and eastern minerals conduct their current exploration operations and pt freeport indonesia conducts its mining operations in indonesia both contracts of work govern our rights and obligations relating to taxes exchange controls royalties repatriation and other matters both contracts of work were concluded pursuant to the 1967 foreign capital investment law which expresses indonesia ’s foreign investment policy and provides basic guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization a framework for economic incentives and basic rules regarding other rights and obligations of foreign investors specifically the contracts of work provide that the government of indonesia will not nationalize or expropriate pt freeport indonesia ’s or eastern minerals’ mining operations any disputes regarding the provisions of the contracts of work are subject to international arbitration we have experienced no disputes requiring arbitration during the 37 years we have operated in indonesia 

pt freeport indonesia ’s contract of work covers both block a which was first included in a 1967 contract of work that was replaced by a new contract of work in 1991 and block b to which we gained rights in 1991 the initial term of our contract of work expires in december 2021 but we can extend it for two 10year periods subject to indonesian government approval which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably we originally had the rights to explore 65 million acres in block b but pursuant to the contract of work we have only retained the rights to approximately 500000 acres which we believe following significant geological assessment contain the most promising exploration opportunities 

eastern minerals signed its contract of work in august 1994 the contract of work originally covered approximately 25 million acres eastern minerals contract of work provides for a fourtoseven year exploratory term and a 30year term for mining operations subject to indonesian government approval which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably we can extend this period for two 10year periods eastern minerals’ contract of work requires us to relinquish our rights to 25 percent of the original 25millionacre contract of work area at the end of each of three specified periods as of december 31 2004 we had relinquished approximately 13 million acres and must relinquish an additional 06 million acres at the end of the threeyear exploration period which can be extended by the government of indonesia for as much as two additional years 

we suspended our exploration activities outside of block a in recent years because of safety and security issues and regulatory uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest areas and an indonesian forestry law enacted in 1999 prohibiting openpit mining in forest preservation areas in 2001 we requested and received from the government of indonesia formal temporary suspensions of our obligations under the contracts of work in all areas outside of block a the current suspensions were granted for oneyear periods ending february 26 2005 for block b march 31 2005 for pt nabire bakti mining and november 15 2004 for eastern minerals recent indonesian legislation permits openpit mining in pt freeport indonesia ’s block b area subject to certain requirements we are currently assessing these requirements and security issues the timing for our resumption of exploration activities in our contract of work areas outside of block a depends on the resolution of these matters 

pt freeport indonesia pays a copper royalty under its contact of work that varies from 15 percent of copper net revenue at a copper price of 090 or less per pound to 35 percent at a copper price of 110 or more per pound the contract of work royalty rate for gold and silver sales is 10 percent 

a large part of the mineral royalties under government of indonesia regulations are designated to the provinces from which the minerals are extracted in connection with our “fourth concentrator mill expansion” pt freeport indonesia agreed to pay the government of indonesia additional royalties royalties not required by our contract of work to provide further support to the local governments and the people of papua pt freeport indonesia pays the additional royalties on metal from production above 200000 metric tons of ore per day the additional royalty for copper equals the contract of work royalty rate and for gold and silver equals twice the contract of work royalty rates therefore our royalty rate on copper net revenues from production above 200000 metric tons of ore per day is double the contract of work royalty rate and our royalty rates on gold and silver sales from production above 200000 metric tons of ore per day are triple the contract of work royalty rates pt freeport indonesia ’s share of the combined royalties including the additional royalties which became effective january 1 1999 totaled 435 million in 2004 265 million in 2003 and 245 million in 2002 

republic of indonesia 

general   the republic of indonesia consists of more than 17000 islands stretching 3000 miles along the equator from malaysia to australia and is the fourth most populous nation in the world with over 230 million people following many years of dutch colonial rule indonesia gained independence in 1945 and now has a presidential republic system of government 

our mining complex was indonesia ’s first copper mining project and was the first major foreign investment in indonesia following the economic development program instituted by the indonesian government in 1967 we work closely with the central provincial and local governments in development efforts in the area surrounding our operations we have had positive relations with the indonesian government since we commenced business activities in indonesia in 1967 and we intend to continue to maintain positive working relationships with the central provincial and local branches of the indonesian government 

political developments in may 1998 president suharto indonesia ’s political leader for more than 30 years resigned in the wake of an economic crisis in indonesia and other parts of southeast asia and in the face of growing social unrest vice president bj habibie succeeded suharto in june 1999 indonesia held a new parliamentary election on a generally peaceful basis as the first step in the process of electing a new president in october 1999 in accordance with the indonesian constitution the country ’s highest political institution the people ’s consultative assembly composed of the newly elected national parliament along with additional provincial and other representatives elected abdurrahman wahid as president and megawati sukarnoputri as vice president 

there were repeated challenges to the political leadership of president wahid after his election in october 1999 in july 2001 the people ’s consultative assembly voted to remove president wahid and elected vice president megawati sukarnoputri as president the 2004 presidential election was conducted peacefully and after a runoff susilo bambang yudhoyono was elected the new president in october 

recent developments   on december 26 2004 a massive earthquake  one of the five strongest ever recorded  struck off the coast of north sumatra in indonesia triggering powerful tsunamis that devastated the coastlines of aceh province in indonesia and areas of thailand india sri lanka and other nations as far away as somalia in africa the human lives lost are currently estimated to total more than 166000 in indonesia alone aceh province at the western tip of sumatra is indonesia ’s westernmost province our operations located 3000 miles away in indonesia ’s easternmost province of papua were not impacted by the tsunamis pt freeport indonesia has provided cash contributions in indonesia and fcx in the united states for immediate assistance and to encourage fundraising efforts we also provided airplanes to transport food and medical supplies aid workers and government officials to the stricken area including some of the first aid shipments to arrive which were received by president yudhoyono 

on august 31 2002 three people were killed and 11 others were wounded in an ambush by a group of unidentified assailants the assailants shot at several vehicles transporting international contract teachers from pt freeport indonesia ’s school in tembagapura their family members and other contractors to pt freeport indonesia on the road near tembagapura the mining town where the majority of pt freeport indonesia ’s personnel reside indonesian authorities and the united states federal bureau of investigation investigated the incident which resulted in the us indictment of an alleged operational commander in the free papua movementnational freedom force 

on october 12 2002 a bombing killed 202 people in the indonesian province of bali which is 1500 miles west of our mining and milling operations indonesian authorities arrested 35 people in connection with this bombing and 29 of those arrested have been tried and convicted on august 5 2003 12 people were killed and over 100 others were injured by a car bomb detonated outside of the jw marriott hotel in jakarta indonesia on september 9 2004 11 people were killed and over 200 others injured by a car bomb detonated in front of the australian embassy the same international terrorist organizations are suspected in each of these incidents our mining and milling operations were not interrupted by these incidents however our corporate offices in jakarta sustained damages as a result of the bombing in front of the australian embassy after relocating for several months our corporate offices in jakarta were reestablished 

the government of indonesia which provides security for pt freeport indonesia ’s personnel and operations see “security matters” has expressed a strong commitment to protect natural resources businesses operating in indonesia including pt freeport indonesia with heightened security following the incidents discussed above 

 

 

 

economic and social conditions   the indonesian economy grew by an estimated 5 percent in 2004 and 4 percent in 2003 the indonesian currency the rupiah averaged approximately 8900 rupiah to one us dollar during 2004 and closed at 9270 rupiah to one us dollar on december 31 2004 compared with 8437 rupiah to one us dollar on december 31 2003 

despite gradual improvements on the economic front indonesia ’s recovery remains vulnerable to ongoing political and social tensions incidents of violence and separatist pressures continue to be reported proindependence movements in certain areas continue to be prominent especially in the province of aceh where the indonesian government signed a peace agreement with separatists in december 2002 and to a lesser extent in papua following the december 2004 tsunamis in aceh negotiations between the government of indonesia and separatists in aceh appear more promising the area surrounding our mining development is sparsely populated by local people and former residents of more populous areas of indonesia some of whom have resettled in papua under the government of indonesia ’s transmigration program a segment of the local population is opposing indonesian rule over papua and several separatist groups have sought political independence for the province in addition to the august 31 2002 shooting incident there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the indonesian military in papua 

our contracts of work and the government of indonesia while the uncertainties of the regional autonomy process have created concern among foreign investors the indonesian government has repeatedly assured investors that existing contracts would be honored government officials have publicly stated that the government of indonesia will honor existing contracts and that they have no intention of revoking or unilaterally amending such contracts specifically including pt freeport indonesia ’s contract of work our belief that our contracts of work will continue to be honored is further supported by us laws which prohibit us aid to countries that nationalize property owned by or take steps to nullify a contract with a us citizen or company at least 50 percent owned by us citizens if the foreign country does not within a reasonable time take appropriate steps to provide full value compensation or other relief under international law 

 

in july 2004 we received a request from the indonesian department of energy and mineral resources that we offer to sell to indonesian nationals shares in pt indocopper investama at fair market value pt indocopper investama which we wholly own has an approximate 936 percent ownership interest in pt freeport indonesia in response to this request and in view of the potential benefits of having additional indonesian ownership in our project we have agreed to consider a potential sale of an interest in pt indocopper investama at fair market value neither our contract of work nor indonesian law requires us to divest any portion of our ownership interest in pt freeport indonesia or pt indocopper investama see “nusamba loan guarantee” 

our investment in indonesia and papua   we have a boardapproved policy statement on social employment and human rights and have comprehensive and extensive social cultural and community development programs to which we have committed significant financial and managerial resources see “social development employment and human rights” these policies and programs are designed to address the impact of our operations on the local villages and people and to provide assistance for the development of the local people while we believe these efforts should serve to avoid damage to and disruptions of our mining operations our operations could be damaged or disrupted by social economic and political forces beyond our control 

pt freeport indonesia contributes to the economies of papua and the republic of indonesia through the payment of taxes dividends and royalties voluntary economic development programs infrastructure development employment and the purchase of local and national goods in fact pt freeport indonesia has frequently been one of the largest taxpayers in the republic of indonesia in addition it pays royalties on all minerals removed from the ground 

since it began development activities more than 35 years ago pt freeport indonesia has made significant investments in infrastructure both for its use and for use by the papuan public these infrastructure improvements include medical facilities roads an airport and heliports schools housing community buildings and places of worship 

pt freeport indonesia is also one of the largest private employers in indonesia and by far the largest in papua as of december 31 2004 pt freeport indonesia directly employed 7858 people and 6247 contract workers provided services to pt freeport indonesia in addition 4587 persons worked for privatized companies providing services within pt freeport indonesia ’s operations area 

 

 

besides the estimated 26 billion paid in direct benefits to the indonesian government under the contract of work from 1992 through 2004 pt freeport indonesia ’s operations have provided another 93 billion during this period in indirect benefits to papua and the republic of indonesia in the form of wages and benefits paid to workers purchases of goods and services charitable contributions and reinvestments in operations for 2004 direct benefits totaled approximately 260 million and indirect benefits totaled approximately 623 million 

 

ore reserves 

during 2004 additions to the aggregate proven and probable reserves of the grasberg and other block a ore bodies in the grasberg minerals district totaled approximately 141 million metric tons of ore representing increases of 29 billion recoverable pounds of copper 22 million recoverable ounces of gold and 189 million recoverable ounces of silver the additions were primarily the result of positive drilling results at the deep mill level zone ore body a 146millionmetricton ore body yearend aggregate proven and probable recoverable reserves net of 2004 production were 28 billion metric tons of ore averaging 109 percent copper 097 grams per metric ton gt of gold and 384 gt of silver representing 562 billion pounds of copper 610 million ounces of gold and 1745 million ounces of silver our aggregate exploration budget for 2005 including rio tinto ’s share is expected to total approximately 21 million 15 million for our share with most of the effort focused on testing the mill level zone and deep mill level zone deposits to the northwest expansion of the underground grasberg resource and testing reconnaissance targets along the wanagon and idenberg fault trends 

pursuant to joint venture arrangements between pt freeport indonesia and rio tinto rio tinto has a 40 percent interest in production from reserves above those reported at december 31 1994 net of rio tinto ’s share pt freeport indonesia ’s share of proven and probable recoverable reserves as of december 31 2004 was 405 billion pounds of copper 465 million ounces of gold and 1245 million ounces of silver fcx ’s equity interest in proven and probable recoverable reserves as of december 31 2004 was 367 billion pounds of copper 421 million ounces of gold and 1128 million ounces of silver we estimated recoverable reserves using an average copper price of 085 per pound and an average gold price of 270 per ounce if metal prices were adjusted to the approximate average london spot prices for the past three years ie copper prices adjusted from 085 per pound to 094 per pound and gold prices adjusted from 270 per ounce to 361 per ounce the additions to proven and probable reserves would not be material to our reported reserves 

all of our proven and probable recoverable reserves lie within block a the grasberg minerals district contains the largest single gold reserve and the secondlargest copper reserves of any mine in the world aggregate grasberg open pit and underground proven and probable recoverable ore reserves as of december 31 2004 are shown below along with those of our other deposits reserve calculations were prepared by our employees under the supervision of george d macdonald our vice president of exploration and were reviewed and verified by independent mining consultants inc experts in mining geology and reserve determination see “risk factors” we developed our current mine plan based on completing the mining of all of our currently designated recoverable reserves before the end of 2041 which would be the expiration of our contract of work including two 10year extensions prior to the expiration of the initial term of our contract of work in december 2021 under our current mine plan we expect to mine approximately 47 percent of aggregate proven and probable ore representing approximately 55 percent of pt freeport indonesia ’s share of recoverable copper reserves and approximately 69 percent of pt freeport indonesia ’s share of recoverable gold reserves 



 



a   ore reserve tonnage estimates are after application of applicable mining recovery factors 



in defining its openpit reserves pt freeport indonesia applies an “economic cutoff grade” strategy the objective of this strategy is to maximize the net present value of its operations pt freeport indonesia uses a breakeven cutoff grade to define the insitu reserves for its underground ore bodies the breakeven cutoff grade is defined for a metric ton of ore as that equivalent copper grade once produced and sold that generates sufficient revenue to cover all operating and administrative costs associated with its production 

 

pt freeport indonesia’s ores contain three recoverable metals copper gold and silver we value all three metals in terms of a copper equivalent percentage to determine a single breakeven cutoff grade copper equivalent percentage is used to express the relative value of multimetal ores in terms of one metal in this case copper the calculation expresses the relative value of the ore using estimates of contained metal quantities metals prices as used for reserve determination recovery rates treatment charges and royalties the table below shows the breakeven cutoff grade expressed as a copper equivalent percentage for each of our existing ore bodies as of december 31 2004 

 

 



the following table sets forth the average drill hole spacing for each of our ore bodies drill hole spacing data is used by mining professionals such as mining engineers in determining the suitability of data coverage on a relative basis in a given deposit type and mining method scenario so as to achieve a given level of confidence in the resource estimate drill hole spacing is only one of several criteria necessary to establish confidence level for resource classification drilling programs are typically designed to achieve an optimum sample spacing to support the level of confidence in results that fit a particular stage of development of a mineral deposit we calculated the average drill hole spacing within each ore body using the distance from the center of each block in the resource model to the nearest drill hole composite we then calculated the averages of these values within the volume of each ore body and reported them under the column entitled “average distance to nearest sample” this value represents at least onehalf of the average drill hole spacing within each deposit we calculated the value under the column entitled “average distance between drill holes” by multiplying the average minimum distance value by two and this value represents the maximum average drill hole spacing 



 

mining operations  mines in production 

we and our predecessors have conducted exploration and mining operations in block a since 1967 and have been the only operator of these operations we currently have two mines in operation the grasberg open pit and the deep ore zone 

we began openpit mining of the grasberg ore body in 1990 openpit operations are expected to continue until 2015 at which time the grasberg underground mining operations are scheduled to begin production is currently at the 3520 to 4060meter elevation level and totaled 489 million metric tons of ore in 2004 and 574 million metric tons of ore in 2003 which provided 76 percent or our 2004 mill feed and 77 percent of our 2003 mill feed our openpit mining rate including ore and overburden totaled 592700 metric tons per day in 2004 and 598800 metric tons per day in 2003 annual production rates are expected to range between 600000 metric tons per day and 750000 metric tons per day through 2010 and then decline through 2015 the grasberg open pit is fully developed and we do not expect to incur any significant development costs other than our deferred mining costs discussed below 

 

the current grasberg equipment fleet consists of over 800 pieces of equipment as of december 31 2004 the larger mining equipment directly associated with production includes 150 haul trucks with payloads ranging from 135 metric tons to 290 metric tons 17 shovels with bucket sizes ranging from 30 cubic meters to 42 cubic meters and 58 bulldozers and graders we believe our current equipment level is adequate to meet our projected production levels over the remaining life of the pit 

 

in addition to the mining equipment grasberg crushing and conveying systems are integral to the mine and provide the capacity to transport up to 225000 metric tons per day of grasberg ore to the mill and 135000 metric tons per day of overburden to the overburden stockpiles 

 

mining costs are charged to operations as incurred however because of the configuration and location of the grasberg openpit ore body and the location and extent of the related surrounding overburden the ratio of overburden to ore is much higher in the initial mining of the open pit than in later years as a result surface mining costs associated with overburden removal at pt freeport indonesia’s grasberg openpit mine that are estimated to relate to future production are initially deferred when the ratio of actual overburden removed to ore mined exceeds the estimated average ratio of overburden removed to ore mined over the life of the grasberg openpit mine those deferred costs are subsequently charged to operating costs when the ratio of actual overburden removed to ore mined falls below the estimated average ratio of overburden to ore over the life of the grasberg openpit mine the reserve quantities used to develop the life of mine ratio are the proven and probable ore quantities for the grasberg open pit shown above 

the application of the deferred mining cost method has resulted in an asset on fcx’s balance sheets “deferred mining costs” which based on current mine plans is estimated to increase through about 2010 subsequently these costs are expected to be amortized as a charge to production and delivery costs until they are fully amortized at the end of the open pit’s life which is estimated to be in approximately 2015 this is because pt freeport indonesia expects to mine higher than average amounts of overburden through 2010 and less than average thereafter deferred mining costs totaled 2204 million at december 31 2004 and 1426 million at december 31 2003 additions to deferred mining costs are classified as increases in deferred mining costs in operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows and totaled 778 million in 2004 644 million in 2003 and 306 million in 2002 see note 1 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in our 2004 annual report incorporated herein by reference 

the deep ore zone ore body lies vertically below the now depleted intermediate ore zone we began production from the deep ore zone ore body in 1989 but we suspended production in 1991 in favor of production from the grasberg deposit production using the blockcave method restarted in september 2000 production is at the 3110meter elevation level and totaled 159 million metric tons of ore in 2004 and 148 million metric tons of ore in 2003 the deep ore zone has performed above design capacity of 35000 metric tons of ore per day and we are expanding the deep ore zone operation to sustained production of 50000 metric tons of ore per day with the installation of a second crusher and additional ventilation production from the deep ore zone averaged 43600 metric tons of ore per day in 2004 and 40500 metric tons of ore per day in 2003 

 

the deep ore zone mine fleet consists of over 160 pieces of mobile equipment the primary mining equipment directly associated with production and development includes 26 loadhauldump lhd units and 15 haul trucks our lhd units typically carry approximately 11 metric tons of ore the units dump into a gyratory crusher and ore is then conveyed to the surface stockpiles 

 

 

during 2004 at the deep ore zone mine we completed 9550 meters of development drifting in support of the blockcave mining method and the ongoing expansion to 50000 metric tons of ore per day the expansion to 50000 metric tons of ore per day is expected to be completed in 2007 with aggregate development costs from 2004 through 2007 to total approximately 62 million approximately 37 million for pt freeport indonesia’s share 

 

our development costs include costs incurred resulting from mine preproduction activities undertaken to gain access to proven and probable reserves including adits drifts ramps permanent excavations infrastructure and removal of overburden depreciation for mining and milling lifeofmine assets is determined using the unitofproduction method based on estimated recoverable proven and probable copper reserves development costs that relate to a specific ore body are depreciated using the unitofproduction method based on estimated recoverable proven and probable copper reserves for the ore body benefited pt freeport indonesia’s total development costs at december 31 2004 for the deep ore zone mine currently our only operating underground mine totaled 1895 million which are being depreciated on a unitofproduction basis over the life of the deep ore zone proven and probable reserves see note 1 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in our 2004 annual report incorporated herein by reference 

the majority of maintenance activities is performed on site by a combination of pt freeport indonesia employees and contract workers as of december 31 2004 we had approximately 7500 employees and contract workers directly involved in grasberg openpit and deep ore zone underground mining milling and ore flow operations 

 

the intermediate ore zone was an underground blockcave operation that began production in the first half of 1994 the intermediate ore zone was depleted during the third quarter of 2003 production totaled 25 million metric tons of ore in 2003 and 71 million metric tons of ore in 2002 during its 10year life the intermediate ore zone operation produced almost 30 percent more copper and gold than the initial reserve estimates 

our principal source of power for all our operations is a coalfired power plant that we built in conjunction with our fourth concentrator expansion see “infrastructure” mediumspeed diesel generators supply peaking and backup power a combination of naturally occurring mountain streams and water derived from our underground operations provides water for our operations the average annual rainfall in the project area is 180 inches 

 

mining operations  mines in development 

    seven other ore bodies referred to as the underground grasberg kucing liar mill level zone deep mill level zone ertsberg stockwork zone big gossan and the dom are located in block a these ore bodies are at various stages of development and are included in our proven and probable recoverable reserves we incurred 29 million for mine development expansion and infrastructure capital expenditures related to these ore bodies and 267 million for common underground infrastructure during the three years ended december 31 2004 see “risk factors” 

the underground grasberg reserves will be mined using the blockcave method at the end of openpit mining which is expected to continue until approximately 2015 the kucing liar ore body lies on the southern flank of and underneath the southern portion of the grasberg open pit at the 2600 to 3200meter elevation level we are reviewing development plans for kucing liar 

the mill level zone ore body lies directly below the deep ore zone mine at the 2900meter elevation the deep mill level zone ore body lies beneath the mill level zone ore body at the 2600meter elevation this ore represents the downward continuation of mineralization in the ertsberg east skarn system and neighboring ertsberg porphyry drilling efforts continue to determine the extent of these ore bodies we expect to mine the mill level zone ore body using a blockcave method after we complete mining at the deep ore zone ore body near the end of mining the mill level zone ore body we expect to mine the deep mill level zone ore body also using a blockcave method 

the ertsberg stockwork zone ore body extends off the southwest side of the deep ore zone ore body at the 3100 to 3600meter elevation level drilling efforts continue to determine the extent of this ore body which we expect to mine using a blockcave method starting in about 2009 

the big gossan ore body is located approximately 1000 meters southwest of the original ertsberg openpit deposit we began the initial underground development of the ore body in 1993 when we drove tunnels from the mill area into the ore zone at the 2600meter elevation level a stope and fill mining method will be used on the big gossan deposit a feasibility study and an update to the sitewide development plan will be completed in 2005 to determine is the timing of initial production currently projected to be 2007 

the dom ore body lies approximately 1500 meters southeast of the depleted ertsberg openpit deposit production at the openpit portion of the ore body will begin after completion of openpit mining at grasberg subsequently followed by blockcave mining of the underground portion of the dom ore body 

the projected aggregate capital expenditures required to reach full production capacity for each of our undeveloped ore bodies based on our latest mine plans and our proven and probable recoverable reserves as of december 31 2004 are shown below in millions actual costs could differ materially from these estimates as we will not incur most of the expenditures for several years and we will incur them over a period of several years based on our current estimates we expect aggregate expenditures will range between 25 million and 265 million annually during the next 15 years in addition these costs will be shared with rio tinto in accordance with our joint venture agreement 



description of ore bodies our ore bodies are located within and around two main igneous intrusions the grasberg monzodiorite and the ertsberg diorite the host rocks of these ore bodies include both carbonate and clastic rocks that form the ridge crests and upper flanks of the sudirman range and the igneous rocks of monzonitic to dioritic composition that intrude them the igneoushosted ore bodies the grasberg open pit and block cave and the ertsberg stockwork zone block cave occur as vein stockworks and disseminations of copper sulphides dominated by chalcopyrite and to a much lesser extent bornite the sedimentaryrock hosted ore bodies occur as “magnetiterich calciummagnesian skarn” replacements whose location and orientation are strongly influenced by major faults and by the chemistry of the carbonate rocks along the margins of the intrusions 

the copper mineralization in these skarn deposits is also dominated by chalcopyrite but higher bornite concentrations are common moreover gold occurs in significant concentrations in all of the district ’s ore bodies though rarely visible to the naked eye these gold concentrations usually occur as inclusions within the copper sulphide minerals though in some deposits these concentrations can also be strongly associated with pyrite 

the following diagram indicates the relative elevations in meters of our reported reserve ore bodies 

  

the following map which encompasses an area of approximately 42 square kilometers approximately 16 square miles indicates the relative positions and sizes of our reported reserve ore bodies and their locations 

the following chart illustrates our current plans for sequencing and producing each of our ore bodies and the years in which we currently expect that production of each ore body will begin and end production volumes are typically lower in the first few years of each ore body as development activities are ongoing and as the mine ramps up to full production currently the grasberg open pit and deep ore zone are our only producing mines the ultimate timing of the start of production from our undeveloped mines is dependent upon a number of factors including the results of our exploration efforts and may vary from the dates shown below in addition we develop our mine plans for the grasberg open pit and underground mines based on maximizing the net present value from the ore bodies 

 

during 2004 we mined an average of 636200 metric tons of material per day including ore and overburden and we do not require any additional approvals for higher rates during 2003 we mined an average of 646100 metric tons of material per day the following chart illustrates our current aggregate mill capacity our aggregate permitted mill capacity and our projected milling rates the decline in milling rates in 2016 reflects the expected completion date of openpit mining at the grasberg ore body we are continuing to develop mine plans to optimize production levels and to offset the anticipated decline in 2016 

 

milling and production 

the ore from our mines moves by a conveyor system to a series of shafts through which it drops to our milling and concentrating complex located approximately 2900 meters above sea level at the mill the ore is crushed and ground and mixed in tanks with water and small amounts of flotation reagents where it is continuously agitated with air during this physical separation process copper gold and silverbearing particles rise to the top of the tanks and are collected and thickened into a concentrate the concentrate leaves the mill complex as a slurry consisting of approximately 65 percent solids by weight and is pumped through three parallel 115kilometer pipelines to our coastal port site facility at amamapare where it is filtered dried and stored for shipping ships are loaded at dock facilities at the port until they draw their maximum dockside water and they then move to deeper water where loading is completed from shuttling barges 

our production results for the last three years are as follows

in october 2003 a slippage of material occurred in a section of the grasberg open pit and in december 2003 a smaller debris flow occurred in the same section the area affected by the slippage events included two active mining areas which were scheduled to be mined in the fourth quarter of 2003 see “grasberg openpit slippage” mill throughput and production in 2003 and 2004 were negatively affected by pt freeport indonesia ’s efforts to accelerate removal of overburden material and restore safe access to highergrade areas in the pit mill throughput averaged 185100 metric tons of ore per day in 2004 a nine percent decrease from the 203000 metric tons average in 2003 copper and gold production was lower in 2004 compared with 2003 reflecting the lower mill throughput and lower average ore grades copper production for 2004 totaled 10 billion pounds 2951 million pounds lower than 2003 production gold production for 2004 totaled 146 million ounces 10 million ounces lower than 2003 production the lower sales volumes and the primarily fixed nature of a large portion of pt freeport indonesia ’s cost structure resulted in average net cash production costs for 2004 increasing to 040 per pound compared with a net credit of 002 per pound for 2003 

copper production for 2003 was 13 billion pounds 2326 million pounds lower than 2002 production primarily because of lower average copper ore grades and lower mill throughput caused by the slippage and debris flow events gold production for 2003 was 166500 ounces higher than that for 2002 primarily because of higher average gold grades 

 

average net cash production costs per pound of copper of a net credit of 002 for 2003 were an annual record low compared with 008 for 2002 higher gold credits in 2003 offset higher site production and delivery costs our average net cash production costs per pound of copper vary with the amount of gold we sell and gold prices among other factors once we complete our openpit mining operations at the grasberg mine in approximately 2015 and transition to underground we expect our share of annual copper and gold production to be lower than current levels and all other factors being equal our average net cash production costs to increase for more information regarding our operating and financial results see our 2004 annual report incorporated herein by reference 

 

geotechnical programs 

 

our geotechnical programs support several phases of the operations including our openpit mine pit slope and overburden stockpile stability our underground mine our infrastructure and our tailings management program for information regarding our tailings management program see “environmental matters” 

 

a group of our senior level employees has the responsibility authority and oversight for our overall geotechnical programs our multidisciplinary approach combines inhouse personnel with backgrounds in civil geotechnical mining engineering geology and hydrology to form a technical services group that reports to our senior managers our technical services group develops information that our mine engineering group uses to develop mine and stockpile designs production schedules and related plans our technical services group also monitors slope stability and other geotechnical and hydrological developments 

 

our technical services group is composed of expatriates and indonesian nationals who are university educated international consulting experts in each of the applicable technical fields support this group inhouse training provided by consultants as well as offsite seminars and industry conferences supports the training of our staff our joint venture partner has also provided geotechnical and engineering support to our operations consultants and our joint venture partner provide input into program development and assess performance of these critical roles 

 

our technical services group uses information from geological drilling for the development and updating of our geological geotechnical and hydrologic models we develop computerbased geologic models for mine design and dewatering programs we provide continuous ground and slope monitoring in our mines on all overburden stockpiles and around all infrastructure using various computerized and automated systems we also daily inspect all openpit working areas with any items of concern being reported to our senior managers our hydrology function measures and tracks water flow patterns to determine the effectiveness and need for dewatering and depressurization programs we drain all surface flows away from the open pit and pump any inpit surface water to dedicated drain holes connected to our underground dewatering drift system we also continuously monitor rainfall at our operations so that we may adjust for operational impacts and safety considerations 

grasberg openpit slippage 

on october 9 2003 a slippage of material occurred in a section of the grasberg open pit eight workers perished and five workers were injured in the incident the area affected by the slippage comprising approximately five percent of the surface area of the massive grasberg pit included two active mining areas that were scheduled to be mined in 2003 and 2004 on december 12 2003 a debris flow involving a relatively small amount of loose material occurred in the same area of the grasberg open pit resulting in only minor property damage following these two events pt freeport indonesia redirected its openpit operations to accelerate removal of waste material from the south wall to restore safe access to the highergrade ore areas in the pit these activities resulted in reduced production levels in april 2004 pt freeport indonesia established safe access and initiated mining in highergrade ore areas while continuing waste removal activities pt freeport indonesia resumed normal milling rates in june 2004 

as a result of the fourthquarter 2003 slippage and debris flow events pt freeport indonesia notified its copper concentrate customers that it was declaring force majeure under the terms of its contracts as it would be unable to satisfy its annual sales and delivery commitments in december 2004 pt freeport indonesia terminated the force majeure that had been in effect since december 2003 under its concentrate sales contracts 

pt freeport indonesia maintains property damage and business interruption insurance related to its operations in december 2004 we entered into an insurance settlement agreement and settled all claims that arose from the fourthquarter 2003 slippage and debris flow events in the grasberg openpit mine pt freeport indonesia ’s insurers agreed to pay an aggregate of 1250 million in connection with its claims after considering our joint venture partner ’s interest in the proceeds pt freeport indonesia ’s share of proceeds totaled 950 million 

 

exploration 

as a result of our joint venture arrangements rio tinto generally pays for 40 percent of our joint venture exploration and exploratory drilling costs in papua the joint ventures incurred total exploration costs of 136 million in 2004 and 105 million in 2003 the joint ventures’ exploration budget for 2005 totals approximately 21 million with most of the effort focused on testing the mill level zone and deep mill level zone deposits to the northwest expansion of the underground grasberg resource and testing reconnaissance targets along the wanagan and idenberg fault trends 

in june 1998 we entered into a joint venture agreement to conduct exploration activities in pt nabire bakti mining ’s contract of work area which currently covers approximately 500000 acres in several blocks contiguous to pt freeport indonesia ’s block b and one of eastern minerals’ blocks in papua rio tinto shares in 40 percent of our interest and costs in this exploration joint venture we and rio tinto can earn up to a 62 percent interest in the pt nabire bakti mining contract of work by spending up to 21 million on exploration and other activities in the joint venture areas we have spent 170 million through december 31 2004 

with the subsequent approval of the indonesian government in 2000 we suspended our field exploration activities in block b which includes the wabu ridge gold prospect as well as in the other contract of work areas of eastern minerals and pt nabire bakti mining the suspensions are due to safety and security issues and regulatory uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest areas and an indonesian forestry law enacted in 1999 prohibiting openpit mining in forest preservation areas all of the suspended areas are outside of our current mining operations area we are assessing the possible timing for resumption of our exploration activities 

infrastructure 

the location of our mining operations in a remote area requires that our operations be virtually selfsufficient in addition to the mining facilities described above in the course of the development of our project we have constructed ourselves or participated with others in the construction of an airport a port a 119 kilometer road an aerial tramway two hospitals and related medical facilities and two town sites with housing schools and other facilities sufficient to support more than 17000 persons 

in 1996 we completed a significant infrastructure program which includes various residential community and commercial facilities we designed the program to provide the infrastructure needed for our operations to enhance the living conditions of our employees and to develop and promote the growth of local and other third party activities and enterprises in papua we have developed the facilities through joint ventures or direct ownership involving local indonesian interests and other investors 

in july 2003 we acquired the 857 percent ownership interest in puncakjaya power owned by affiliates of duke energy corporation for 681 million cash net of 99 million of cash acquired puncakjaya power is the owner of assets supplying power to pt freeport indonesia ’s operations including the 3x65 megawatt coalfired power facilities pt freeport indonesia purchases power from puncakjaya power under infrastructure asset financing arrangements at december 31 2004 pt freeport indonesia had infrastructure asset financing obligations to puncakjaya power totaling 2587 million as a result of our acquisition of the 857 percent ownership interest our consolidated balance sheet no longer reflects pt freeport indonesia ’s obligation to puncakjaya power but instead reflects the puncakjaya power bank debt which totaled 1870 million and a receivable from rio tinto totaling 735 million for its share of the obligation to puncakjaya power at december 31 2004 

marketing 

pt freeport indonesia sells its copper concentrates which contain significant quantities of gold and silver under united states dollardenominated sales agreements mostly to companies in asia and europe and to international trading companies we sell substantially all of our budgeted production of copper concentrates under longterm contracts with selling prices based on world metals prices generally the london metal exchange settlement prices for grade a copper under these contracts initial billing occurs at the time of shipment and final settlement on the copper portion is generally based on average prices for a specified future period gold generally is sold at the average london bullion market association price for a specified month near the month of shipment 

 

revenues from concentrate sales are recorded net of royalties see “contracts of work” treatment and refining charges including participation charges if applicable based on the market prices of metals and the impact of derivative financial instruments if any used to hedge against risks from metals price fluctuations moreover because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrates is unrecoverable as a result of the smelting process our revenues from concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances based on the quantity and value of these unrecoverable metals these allowances are a negotiated term of our contracts and vary by customer treatment and refining charges represent payments to smelters and refiners and are either fixed or in certain cases vary with the price of copper we sell a small amount of copper concentrates in the spot market see “risk factors” 

we have commitments including commitments from atlantic copper and pt smelting for essentially all of our estimated 2005 production we estimate our share of sales for 2005 to approximate 15 billion pounds of copper and 29 million ounces of gold projected 2005 copper and gold sales reflect the expectation of higher production following completion of efforts to restore safe access to highgrade ore areas in the grasberg open pit see “risk factors” 

pt freeport indonesia has a longterm contract through 2007 to provide atlantic copper with a quantity of copper concentrates at market prices which currently approximates 60 percent of atlantic copper ’s annual copper concentrate requirements pt freeport indonesia ’s agreement with pt smelting provides for the life of pt freeport indonesia ’s mines for the supply of 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements necessary to produce 205000 metric tons of copper essentially the gresik smelter ’s original design capacity on a priority basis in 2004 pt smelting increased its stated production capacity to 250000 metric tons of copper per year for the first 15 years of pt smelting ’s commercial operations beginning december 1998 pt freeport indonesia agreed that the treatment and refining charges on specified quantities of the concentrate pt freeport indonesia supplies will not fall below specified minimum rates subject to renegotiation in 2008 the rate was 023 per pound during the period from the commencement of pt smelting ’s operations in 1998 until april 3 2004 when it declined to a minimum of 021 per pound we anticipate that pt freeport indonesia will sell approximately 50 percent of its annual concentrate production to atlantic copper and pt smelting in 2004 the percentage of concentrate pt freeport indonesia sold to atlantic copper and pt smelting was closer to 60 percent because of reduced production levels following the grasberg slippage events and pt freeport indonesia’s commitments to provide pt smelting with concentrate on a priority basis a summary of pt freeport indonesia ’s aggregate percentage concentrate sales to its affiliates and to other parties for the last three years follows 



investment in smelters 

our investment in smelters atlantic copper and pt smelting serves an important role in our concentrate marketing strategy pt freeport indonesia generally sells approximately onehalf of its concentrate production to its affiliated smelters atlantic copper and pt smelting and the remainder to other customers treatment charges for smelting and refining copper concentrates represent a cost to pt freeport indonesia and income to atlantic copper and pt smelting through downstream integration we are assured placement of a significant portion of our concentrate production while low smelting and refining charges in recent years adversely affected the operating results of atlantic copper they benefited the operating results of pt freeport indonesia ’s mining operations effectively achieving a hedge for these charges 

atlantic copper sa we own 100 percent of atlantic copper atlantic copper completed the last expansion of its production capacity in 1997 and its smelter currently has a design capacity of 290000 metric tons of copper per year we have no present plans to expand atlantic copper ’s production capacity during 2004 atlantic copper treated 768100 metric tons of concentrate and scrap and produced 224300 metric tons of new copper anodes during 2003 atlantic copper treated 964400 metric tons of concentrate and scrap and produced 290300 metric tons of new copper anodes atlantic copper completed a 51day scheduled major maintenance turnaround in may 2004 adversely affecting 2004 results major maintenance turnarounds of this duration typically occur approximately every nine years for atlantic copper with significantly shorterterm maintenance turnarounds occurring in the interim atlantic copper purchased approximately 27 percent of its 2004 concentrate requirements from pt freeport indonesia at market prices atlantic copper has experienced no material operating problems and we are not aware of any potential material environmental liabilities at atlantic copper 

 

 

we contributed 2020 million to atlantic copper in 2004 100 million in 2003 and 250 million in 2002 in addition we loaned 1895 million to atlantic copper in 2004 the funds were used to improve atlantic copper ’s financial structure during its major maintenance turnaround and during a period of extremely low treatment and refining charge rates which have negatively affected atlantic copper ’s results our total investment in atlantic copper through december 31 2004 was 4569 million 

pt smelting pt freeport indonesia ’s contract of work required us to construct or cause to be constructed a smelter in indonesia if we and the indonesian government determined that such a project would be economically viable in 1995 following the completion of a feasibility study we entered into agreements relating to the formation of pt smelting and the construction of the copper smelter in gresik indonesia 

pt smelting is a joint venture among pt freeport indonesia mitsubishi materials corporation mitsubishi corporation and nippon mining  metals co ltd which own 25 percent 605 percent 95 percent and 5 percent respectively of the outstanding pt smelting common stock in accordance with the joint venture agreements pt freeport indonesia provides the majority of pt smelting ’s copper concentrate requirements in december 2003 pt smelting ’s shareholder agreement was amended to eliminate pt freeport indonesia ’s assignment of its earnings in pt smelting to support a 13 percent cumulative annual return to the other owners for the first 20 years of operations no amounts were paid under this assignment pt freeport indonesia ’s total investment in pt smelting through december 31 2004 was 987 million 

during 2004 pt smelting treated 758100 metric tons of concentrate and produced 211600 metric tons of new copper anodes during 2003 pt smelting treated 824800 metric tons of concentrate and produced 247400 metric tons of new copper anodes pt smelting completed a 31day major maintenance turnaround in the second quarter of 2004 major maintenance turnarounds of this duration typically occur approximately every four years for pt smelting with significantly shorter term maintenance turnarounds in the interim pt smelting has experienced no material operating problems and we are not aware of any potential material environmental liabilities at pt smelting 

competition 

we compete with other mining companies in the sale of our mineral concentrates and the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel some competing companies possess financial resources greater than ours and possess multiple mining assets less geographically concentrated in a single area than ours we believe however that we are one of the lowestcost copper producers in the world after taking into account credits for related gold and silver production which gives us a significant competitive advantage 

social development employment and human rights 

we have a social employment and human rights policy designed to result in our operating in compliance with the laws in the areas of our operations and in a manner that respects basic human rights and the culture of the people who are indigenous to the area we continue to incur significant costs on social and cultural activities primarily in papua these activities include 















in 1996 pt freeport indonesia agreed to commit at least one percent of its revenues to the freeport partnership fund for community development formerly the freeport fund for irian jaya development to support villagebased health education economic and social development programs in its area of operations this commitment replaced our community development programs in which we spent a similar amount of money each year our contributions totaled 175 million in 2004 174 million in 2003 and 152 million in 2002 to the freeport partnership fund for community development 

 

 

lembaga pembangunan masyarakat amungme kamoro lpmak oversees disbursement of the funds we contribute to the fund lpmak ’s board of commissioners is made up of a leader of the amungme people a leader of the kamoro people leaders of the three local churches a representative of the local government and a representative of pt freeport indonesia 

we believe that our social and economic development programs are responsive to the issues raised by the local villages and people and should help us to avoid disruptions of mining operations nevertheless social and political instability in the area may adversely impact our mining operations see “risk factors” 

in december 2000 we endorsed the joint us state departmentbritish foreign office voluntary principles on human rights and security several major natural resources companies and important human rights organizations also endorsed the voluntary principles we participated in drafting these principles with all of the parties involved and incorporated them into our social and human rights policy 

security matters 

consistent with our contract of work and duty to protect our employees and property we have taken appropriate steps to provide a safe and secure working environment as part of its security program pt freeport indonesia maintains its own internal security department which performs functions such as protecting company facilities monitoring the shipment of company goods through the airport and terminal assisting in traffic control and aiding rescue operations pt freeport indonesia ’s civilian security employees numbering about 700 are unarmed and perform duties consistent with their internal security role pt freeport indonesia ’s share of costs for its internal civilian security department totaled 123 million for 2004 112 million for 2003 and 77 million for 2002 the security department has received human rights training and each member is required to certify his or her compliance with our human rights policy 

pt freeport indonesia and all businesses and residents of indonesia relies on the government of indonesia for the provision of public order upholding the rule of law and the protection of personnel and property the grasberg mine has been designated by the government of indonesia as one of indonesia ’s vital national assets this designation results in the military ’s playing a significant role in protecting the area of our operations the government of indonesia is responsible for employing police and military personnel and directing their operations 

from the outset of pt freeport indonesia ’s operations the government has looked to pt freeport indonesia to provide logistical and infrastructure support and assistance for these necessary services because of the limited resources of the indonesian government and the remote location of and lack of development in papua pt freeport indonesia ’s financial support for the indonesian government security institutions assigned to the operations area represents a prudent response to its requirements to protect its workforce and property better ensuring that personnel are properly fed and lodged and have the logistical resources to patrol pt freeport indonesia ’s roads and secure its operating area in addition provision of such support and oversight is consistent with pt freeport indonesia ’s obligations under the contract of work reflects our philosophy of responsible corporate citizenship and is in keeping with our commitment to pursue practices that will promote human rights which include our endorsement of the joint us state departmentbritish foreign office voluntary principles on human rights and security 

pt freeport indonesia ’s share of support costs for the governmentprovided security involving over 2400 indonesian government security personnel currently located in the general area of our operations was 69 million for 2004 59 million for 2003 and 56 million for 2002 this supplemental support consists of various infrastructure and other costs such as food housing fuel travel vehicle repairs allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs and community assistance programs conducted by the militarypolice pt freeport indonesia ’s capital costs for associated infrastructure was 02 million for 2004 06 million for 2003 and 04 million for 2002 

environmental matters 

we have a boardapproved environmental policy that commits us not only to compliance with applicable federal state and local environmental statutes and regulations but also to continuous improvement of our environmental performance at every operational site we believe that we conduct our indonesian operations pursuant to all necessary permits and are in compliance in all material respects with applicable indonesian environmental laws rules and regulations additionally the environmental management systems for our pt freeport indonesia mining and milling operations and our atlantic copper smelting operations are iso international standardization organization 14001 certified 

 

mining operations on the scale of our operations in papua involve significant environmental challenges primarily related to the disposition of tailings which are the crushed and ground rock material resulting from the physical separation of commercially valuable minerals from the ore we have comprehensive ongoing environmental management and monitoring plans for the disposal of tailings resulting from our milling operations which the government of indonesia has approved pursuant to these plans we manage and monitor the impact of our tailings disposal on the surrounding area of the ajkwa river and adjoining water bodies and the surrounding coastal areas in 1997 we completed an engineered levee system to minimize the impact of the tailings through a controlled deposition area located on a portion of the flood plain on the ajkwa river 

in furtherance of our commitments to the indonesian government pursuant to our tailings management plan we monitor the acidneutralizing capacity of tailings on a daily basis to ensure the discharge of nonacid generating tailings into our tailings deposition area the net acidneutralizing capacity of our tailings discharge is maintained through a managed program of blending underground ore with ore from the open pit the addition of supplemental limestone or lime to the ore blend and the addition of lime for control of the ph levels in the flotation system daily samples are collected and tested and this data is communicated to our mill operations so that adjustments in ore blending and limelimestone addition can be made as appropriate 

with respect to overburden control and treatment of acid rock drainage is our primary environmental issue our approaches to this issue include the prevention of acid rock drainage generation the control of acid rock drainage migration and the capture and treatment of acid rock drainage emanating from the overburden stockpile in addition tests have shown the feasibility of revegetating the overburden stockpile and as a result we have engaged in stockpile reclamation as an additional means of mitigating acid rock drainage 

we have made significant capital expenditures with respect to the capture and treatment of acid rock drainage and additional capital expenditures are currently in progress we continue to evaluate various technologies for the treatment of captured acid rock drainage currently acid rock drainage collected by boreholes at the base of the overburden stockpile is treated using conventional lime neutralization 

we have also committed to the indonesian government to have independent external environmental audits of our papuan operations performed by qualified experts every three years with results available for public review we have had three independent environmental audits conducted by internationally recognized consulting and auditing firms sgs international certification services indonesia a member of the société générale de surveillance group completed the 2002 environmental audit the 2002 audit found the overall approach to practical management of environmental issues at pt freeport indonesia to be very sound there were no audit findings requiring corrective action we also are continuing our annual internal audits through the life of our mining operations so that our environmental management and monitoring programs will remain sound and our operations will remain in material compliance with local laws 

in connection with obtaining our environmental approvals from the indonesian government we committed to performing a onetime environmental risk assessment on the impacts of our tailings management plan we completed this extensive environmental risk assessment with more than 90 scientific studies conducted over four years and submitted it to the indonesian government in december 2002 we developed the risk assessment exercise with input from an independent review panel which included representatives from the indonesian government academia and nongovernmental organizations the risks that we identified during this process were in line with our impact projections of the tailings management program contained in our environmental approval documents 

we have environmental approvals from the government of indonesia to expand our milling rate up to a maximum of 300000 metric tons of ore per day in 2004 we averaged 185100 metric tons of ore per day and in 2003 we averaged 203000 metric tons of ore per day 

the cost of complying with environmental laws is a fundamental cost of our business we incurred aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs totaling 651 million in 2004 721 million in 2003 and 626 million in 2002 including tailings management levee maintenance and mine reclamation in 2005 we expect to incur approximately 21 million of aggregate environmental capital expenditures and 39 million of other environmental costs these environmental expenditures are part of our overall 2005 operating budget 

 

 

we are currently revegetating portions of the tailings deposition area upon the completion of our mining operations we will fulfill the remaining commitments we made to the indonesian government in connection with our tailings management plan our options for revegetation of affected areas of the deposition area include natural revegetation forage crops and grasses fruits grains and vegetables and other traditional food and medicinal crops decisions on these options are made in consultation with local and regional government local residents and other stakeholders in addition to the revegetation and reclamation of the deposition area we will continue to operate treatment systems as long as necessary we also monitor and test the water discharged from our mine and the ph sulfate and electrical conductivity levels of ground water in the deposition area the stability of our levees will be ensured through routine visual inspection revegetation of the levee embankments and the transfer of our levee roads for public use moreover we will submit an annual written report to the indonesian government regarding our reclamation activities 

our ultimate reclamation and closure activities will be determined after consultation with the indonesian government local residents and other parties our best estimate is that pt freeport indonesia ’s total aggregate reclamation and closure obligations totaled approximately 149 million as of december 31 2004 estimates of reclamation and closure costs involve complex issues requiring integrated assessments over a period of many years and we may revise them as we perform more complete studies some reclamation costs will be incurred during mining activities while most closure costs and the remaining reclamation costs will be incurred at the end of mining activities which are currently estimated to continue for more than 35 years 

moreover we cannot predict with any certainty the ultimate future uses of the tailings deposition area once our mining operations are completed in addition to forage crop and grass planting and food and medicinal crop production possible future uses of the tailings deposition area include rainforest regrowth production of timber fuel woods fruits and nuts and other economic forestry and the cultivation of fish shellfish and other aquaculture the ultimate future uses will be determined in consultation with local and regional government local residents and other stakeholders 

in 1996 we began contributing to a cash fund 60 million balance at december 31 2004 designed to accumulate at least 100 million by the end of our indonesian mining activities we plan to use this fund including accrued interest to pay for mine closure and reclamation costs any incremental costs in excess of this 100 million fund are expected to be incurred throughout the life of the mine and would be funded by operational cash flow or other sources an increasing emphasis on environmental issues and future changes in regulations could require us to incur additional costs that would be charged against future operations estimates involving environmental matters are by their nature imprecise and changes in government regulations operations technology and inflation could require us to revise them over time 

we believe that atlantic copper ’s facilities and operations are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable spanish environmental laws rules and regulations however in july 2002 the integrated pollution prevention and control guidelines were adopted under spanish law with a phase in for compliance by 2007 atlantic copper working with local environmental authorities is continually assessing the impact of these new guidelines on its operations and has budgeted approximately 30 million as its best estimate of the remaining required capital expenditures from 2005 through 2007 to comply in 2002 the environmental management systems at atlantic copper ’s operations in huelva cordoba and barcelona were audited by the spanish association for standardization and certification aenor in accordance with the iso 1400196 international certification standard and the new european union environmental ecomanagement and ecoauditing emas regulation no 7612001 aenor is a spanish notforprofit entity that has been accredited by the spanish government to inspect audit and certify environmental management systems atlantic copper received positive results from the audits which are required annually to retain the iso 14001 certification that atlantic copper achieved in prior years 

the indonesian and spanish governments may periodically revise their environmental laws and regulations or adopt new ones and we cannot predict the effects on our operations of new or revised regulations we have expended significant resources both financial and managerial to comply with environmental regulations and permitting and approval requirements and we anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future there can be no assurance that we will not incur additional significant costs and liabilities to comply with such current and future regulations or that such regulations will not materially affect our operations see “risk factors” 

 

wanagon overburden stockpile slippage 

in may 2000 a slippage occurred in the overburden stockpile at the wanagon basin following a period of excessive rainfall causing a wave of water and material to overflow from the basin four employees of a contractor to pt freeport indonesia were working in the area and perished contained within the mud were the treatment solids from the lime precipitation of acid rock drainage which then entered the tailings river system near the village of banti we incurred environmental costs for overburden disposition overburden stockpile stabilization laboratory testing and consulting studies relating to the wanagon overburden waste stockpile pt freeport indonesia charged 29 million to its 2000 production costs primarily for assets lost as a result of the incident 

sampling and monitoring were renewed and expanded at a number of stations covering the entire tailings system between the mine and estuary a specific environmental risk analysis was conducted as a result of this event and used data from the monitoring program no longterm environmental effects were found from the direct monitoring nor predicted by the environmental risk assessment the slippage caused a flow of sediments containing elevated levels of precipitated copper as a result water quality in the river was temporarily diminished due to higher levels of total suspended solids according to water quality tests the preslippage water quality in the river was substantially reestablished by the following day and was fully reestablished within 22 days after the incident 

pt freeport indonesia engaged international experts and outside consultants led by a team from the institute of technology of bandung indonesia to conduct a comprehensive study of the cause of the slippage and to recommend a future course of action working with the close cooperation of the indonesian department of energy and natural resources and also bapedal the indonesian environmental protection agency we initiated an overburden stockpile stabilization program and voluntarily agreed to a temporary limitation on average production from the grasberg open pit of 200000 metric tons per day underground ore production was not affected a safezone based on engineering calculations was subsequently identified along the wanagon river and within the village of banti the residents within this zone were temporarily moved to tembagapura our original mining town site and the houses were removed these families were relocated to new housing designed according to their wishes and located on higher ground in banti 

after successful completion of the stabilization program and consultation with affected local residents and with the approval of the indonesian government normal overburden placement at the wanagon overburden stockpile resumed and the restriction on production from the grasberg open pit was lifted at the end of 2000

this report contains “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws forwardlooking statements are all statements other than statements of historical facts such as statements regarding anticipated production volumes sales volumes ore grades commodity prices development and capital expenditures mine production and development plans environmental reclamation and closure cost and plans reserve estimates political economic and social conditions in our areas of operations and exploration efforts and results except for our ongoing obligations under the federal securities laws we do not intend and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements readers are cautioned that forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially from those projected anticipated or assumed in the forwardlooking statements important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements include the following 

because our primary operating assets are located in the republic of indonesia our business may be adversely affected by indonesian political economic and social uncertainties in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in a foreign country 

indonesia has faced political economic and social uncertainties including separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces in particular several separatist groups are opposing indonesian rule over the province of papua where our mining operations are located and have sought political independence for the province in response to demands for political independence new indonesian regional autonomy laws became effective january 1 2001 however the manner in which the new laws are being implemented and the degree of political and economic autonomy that they may bring to individual provinces including papua is uncertain and is a current issue in indonesian politics moreover in papua there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the indonesian military social economic and political instability in papua could materially and adversely affect us if this instability results in damage to our property or interruption of our activities 

maintaining a good working relationship with the indonesian government is important to us because all of our mining operations are located in indonesia and are conducted pursuant to contracts of work with the indonesian government accordingly we are also subject to the usual risks associated with conducting business in and with a foreign country including the risk of forced modification of existing contracts changes in the country ’s laws and policies including those relating to taxation royalties divestment imports exports and currency and the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel or having to enforce the judgment of a foreign court or arbitration panel against a sovereign nation within its own territory in addition we are subject to the risk of expropriation and our insurance does not cover losses caused by expropriation 

 

 

in addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry we face additional risks because our operations are located on difficult terrain in a very remote area 

our mining operations are located in steeply mountainous terrain in a very remote area in indonesia because of these conditions we have had to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities in addition the area receives considerable rainfall which has led to periodic floods and mudslides the mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time in addition to these special risks we are also subject to the usual risks associated with the mining industry such as the risk of encountering unexpected geological conditions that may result in caveins and flooding of mine areas our insurance may not sufficiently cover an unexpected natural or operating disaster 

on october 9 2003 a slippage of material occurred in a section of the grasberg open pit resulting in eight fatalities on december 12 2003 a debris flow involving a relatively small amount of loose material occurred in the same section of the open pit resulting in only minor property damage all material involved in the affected mining areas has been removed the events caused us to alter our shortterm mine sequencing plans which adversely affected our 2003 and 2004 production while we resumed normal production activities in the second quarter of 2004 no assurance can be given that these events will not adversely affect production over the longer term or that similar events will not occur in the future 

the terrorist attacks in the united states on september 11 2001 recent attacks in indonesia and the potential for additional future terrorist acts and other recent events have created economic and political uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business and the prices of our securities 

on august 31 2002 three people were killed and 11 others were wounded in an ambush by a group of unidentified assailants the assailants shot at several vehicles transporting international contract teachers from our school in tembagapura their family members and other contractors to pt freeport indonesia on the road near tembagapura the mining town where the majority of pt freeport indonesia ’s personnel reside we along with the united states government the central indonesian government the papuan provincial and local governments and leaders of the local people residing in the area of our operations condemned the attack indonesian authorities and the united states federal bureau of investigation investigated the incident which resulted in the us indictment of an alleged operational commander of the free papua movementnational freedom force 

 

on october 12 2002 a bombing killed 202 people in the indonesian province of bali which is 1500 miles west of our mining and milling operations indonesian authorities arrested 35 people in connection with this bombing and 29 of those arrested have been tried and convicted on august 5 2003 12 people were killed and over 100 others were injured by a car bomb detonated outside of the jw marriott hotel in jakarta indonesia on september 9 2004 11 people were killed and over 200 others injured by a car bomb detonated in front of the australian embassy in jakarta the same international terrorist organizations are suspected in each of these incidents our mining and milling operations were not interrupted by these incidents but our corporate office in jakarta had to relocate for several months following the bombing in front of the australian embassy 

we cannot predict whether there will be additional incidents similar to the recent shooting or bombings if there were to be additional separatist terrorist or other violence in indonesia it could materially and adversely affect our business and profitability in ways that we cannot predict at this time 

terrorist attacks and other recent events have caused uncertainty in the world ’s financial and insurance markets and may significantly increase global political economic and social instability including in indonesia in addition to the bali jw marriott hotel and australian embassy bombings there have been antiamerican demonstrations in certain sections of indonesia reportedly led by radical islamic activists radical activists have also threatened to attack foreign interests and have called for the expulsion of united states and british citizens and companies from indonesia 

it is possible that further acts of terrorism may be directed against the united states domestically or abroad and such acts could be directed against properties and personnel of companies such as ours the attacks and the resulting economic and political uncertainties including the potential for further terrorist acts have caused our insurance premiums to increase moreover while our property and business interruption insurance covers damages to insured property directly caused by terrorism this insurance does not cover damages and losses caused by war terrorism and war developments may materially and adversely affect our business and profitability and the prices of our securities in ways that we cannot predict at this time 

 

 

our profitability can vary significantly with fluctuations in the market prices of copper and gold 

our revenues are derived primarily from the sale of copper concentrates which also contain significant quantities of gold and silver and from the sale of copper cathodes and anodes although we sell most of our copper concentrates under longterm contracts the selling price is based on world metal prices at or near the time of shipment and delivery 

 

during 2004 the daily closing prices on the london spot market ranged from 106 to 149 per pound for copper and 374 to 456 per ounce for gold during 2003 the daily closing prices on the london spot market ranged from 070 to 105 per pound for copper and 320 to 417 per ounce for gold 

world copper prices have historically fluctuated widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control including 











world gold prices also have historically fluctuated widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control including 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

any material decrease in market prices of copper or gold would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition see our 2004 annual report incorporated herein by reference for an analysis of the effect on our revenues and net income of changes in copper and gold prices 

our contracts of work are subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations and if a dispute arises we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel 

pt freeport indonesia ’s contracts of work and other contracts of work in which we have an interest were entered into under indonesia ’s 1967 foreign capital investment law which provides guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization our contracts of work can be terminated by the government of indonesia if we do not satisfy our contractual obligations which include the payment of royalties and taxes to the government and the satisfaction of certain mining environmental safety and health requirements indonesian government officials have periodically raised questions regarding our compliance with indonesian environmental 

 

 

laws and regulations and the terms of the contracts of work in order to address these questions the indonesian government formed a factfinding team in 2000 that reviewed our compliance with all aspects of pt freeport indonesia ’s contract of work when or whether the indonesian government will release any report on its investigation is uncertain in addition we cannot assure you that the indonesian government ’s report if and when it is released will conclude that we are complying with all of the provisions of pt freeport indonesia ’s contract of work 

moreover in recent years certain government officials and others in indonesia have questioned the validity of contracts entered into by the government of indonesia prior to october 1999  ie  during the suharto regime including pt freeport indonesia ’s contract of work which was signed in december 1991 we cannot assure you that the validity of or our compliance with the contracts of work will not be challenged for political or other reasons pt freeport indonesia ’s contracts of work and our other contracts of work require that disputes with the indonesian government be submitted to international arbitration notwithstanding that provision if a dispute arises under the contracts of work we face the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel and if we prevail in such a dispute we will face the additional risk of having to enforce the judgment of a foreign court or arbitration panel against indonesia within its own territory 

any suspension of required activities under our contracts of work requires the consent of the indonesian government 

our contracts of work permit us to suspend certain contractually required activities including exploration for a period of one year by making a written request to the indonesian government these requests are subject to the approval of the indonesian government and are renewable annually if we do not request a suspension or are denied a suspension then we are required to continue our activities under the contract of work or potentially be declared in default moreover if a suspension continues for more than one year for reasons other than force majeure and the indonesian government has not approved such continuation then the government would be entitled to declare a default under the contract of work 

we suspended our field exploration activities outside of block a in recent years due to safety and security issues and regulatory uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest areas and an indonesian forestry law enacted in 1999 prohibiting openpit mining in forest preservation areas in 2001 we requested and received from the government of indonesia formal temporary suspensions of our obligations under the contracts of work in all areas outside of block a recent indonesian legislation permits openpit mining in pt freeport indonesia ’s block b area subject to certain requirements we are currently assessing these requirements and security issues the timing for the resumption of exploration activities in our contract of work areas outside of block a depends on the resolution of these matters 

our mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges and future changes in environmental laws or unanticipated environmental impacts from our operations could require us to incur increased costs 

mining operations on the scale of our operations in papua involve significant environmental risks and challenges our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of crushed and ground rock material called tailings that results from the process by which we physically separate the copper gold and silverbearing materials from the ore that we mine our tailings management plan uses the river system near our mine to transport the tailings to the lowlands where the tailings and natural sediments are deposited in a controlled area contained within a levee system that will be revegetated we incurred aggregate costs relating to tailings management of 118 million in 2004 83 million in 2003 and 70 million in 2002 

another major environmental challenge is managing overburden which is the rock that must be moved aside in the mining process in order to reach the ore in the presence of air water and naturally occurring bacteria some overburden can cause acid rock drainage or acidic water containing dissolved metals which if not properly managed can have a negative impact on the environment 

certain indonesian governmental officials have from time to time raised issues with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans including a suggestion that we implement a pipeline system rather than our river deposition system for tailings disposal because our mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area a pipeline system would be costly difficult to construct and maintain and more prone to catastrophic failure an external panel of qualified experts as directed in our 300k andal the environmental impact 

 

 

assessment document submitted to the indonesian government conducted detailed reviews and analyses of a number of technical studies they concluded that all significant impacts identified were in line with the 300k andal predictions and that the current system of riverine tailings management was appropriate considering all sitespecific factors for these reasons we do not believe that a pipeline system is necessary or practical 

we anticipate that we will continue to spend significant financial and managerial resources on environmental compliance in addition changes in indonesian environmental laws or unanticipated environmental impacts from our operations could require us to incur significant unanticipated costs 

the volume and grade of the reserves we recover and our rates of production may be more or less than we anticipate 

our reserve amounts are determined in accordance with established mining industry practices and standards but are merely estimates of the mineral deposits that can be recovered economically and legally in addition our ore bodies may not conform to standard geological expectations because ore bodies do not contain uniform grades of minerals our metal recovery rates will vary from time to time which will result in variations in the volumes of minerals that we can sell from period to period some of our reserves may become unprofitable to develop if there are unfavorable longterm market price fluctuations in copper and gold or if there are significant increases in our operating or capital costs in addition our exploration programs may not result in the discovery of additional mineral deposits that we can mine profitably 

we do not expect to mine all of our reserves before the initial term of our contract of work expires 

all of our current proven and probable reserves including the grasberg deposit are located in block a the initial term of our contract of work covering these reserves expires at the end of 2021 we can extend this term for two successive 10year periods subject to the approval of the indonesian government which under our contract of work cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably our reserves reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041  ie  through the expiration of the two 10year extensions and our current mine plan has been developed and our operations are based on the assumption that we will receive the two 10year extensions as a result we will not mine all of our reserves during the current term of our contract of work and there can be no assurance that the indonesian government will approve the extensions prior to the end of 2021 we expect to mine approximately 47 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable ore at december 31 2004 representing approximately 55 percent of pt freeport indonesia ’s share of recoverable copper reserves and approximately 69 percent of its share of recoverable gold reserves 

servicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors some of which are beyond our control 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our maturing debt depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow this ability to a significant extent is subject to commodity prices and general economic financial regulatory political and other factors that are beyond our control in addition our ability to borrow funds in the future to service our debt will depend on meeting the financial covenants in our 10⅛ senior notes due 2010 our 6⅞ senior notes due 2014 our bank credit facilities and other debt agreements we may have in the future future borrowings may not be available to us under our bank credit facilities or from the capital markets in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund other liquidity needs as a result we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our debt on favorable terms could materially and adversely affect our financial condition 

covenants in our bank credit facilities impose restrictions on us 

although we currently have no amounts outstanding under our bank credit facilities our bank credit facilities 



 



 



 

 



 



 



 



 

events beyond our control including changes in general economic and business conditions may affect our ability to satisfy these covenants which could result in a default if an event of default occurs the banks could declare any amounts outstanding together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable an event of default under our bank credit facilities may also give rise to an event of default under our other existing and future debt agreements 

covenants in our 10⅛ senior notes due 2010 and 6⅞ senior notes due 2014 also impose restrictions on us 

our 10⅛ senior notes and our 6⅞ senior notes limit among other things our ability to 











movements in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates could negatively affect our operating results 

all of our revenues and a significant portion of our costs are denominated in us dollars however some costs and certain asset and liability accounts are denominated in indonesian rupiah australian dollars or euros as a result we are generally less profitable when the us dollar weakens in relation to these foreign currencies 

the rupiahus dollar daily closing exchange rate ranged from 8316 to 9479 rupiah per us dollar during 2004 and on december 31 2004 the closing exchange rate was 9270 rupiah per us dollar compared with 8437 rupiah per us dollar on december 31 2003 during 2004 the australian dollarus dollar daily closing exchange rate ranged from 068 to 080 per australian dollar and the eurous dollar daily closing exchange rate ranged from 118 to 137 per euro on december 31 2004 and 2003 the closing exchange rates were 078 per australian dollar and 136 per euro and 075 per australian dollar and 126 per euro respectively 

from time to time we have in the past and may in the future implement currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates however our hedging strategies may not be successful and any of our unhedged foreign exchange payment requirements will continue to be subject to market fluctuations in addition our bank credit facilities are based on fluctuating interest rates accordingly an increase in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

because we are a holding company our ability to pay our debts depends upon the ability of our subsidiaries to pay us dividends and to advance us funds in addition our ability to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries’ assets is generally subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries’ creditors 

because we conduct business primarily through pt freeport indonesia our major subsidiary and other subsidiaries our ability to pay our debts depends upon the earnings and cash flow of pt freeport indonesia and our other subsidiaries and their ability to pay us dividends and to advance us funds contractual and legal restrictions applicable to our subsidiaries could also limit our ability to obtain cash from them our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries’ assets upon their liquidation reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries’ creditors including any trade creditors and preferred shareholders 

 

 













 item 3 legal proceedings   

 

we are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings of a character normally incident to the ordinary course of our business we believe that potential liability in such proceedings would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations we maintain liability insurance to cover some but not all potential liabilities normally incident to the ordinary course of our business as well as other insurance coverage customary in our business with coverage limits that we deem prudent

pt freeport indonesia conducts its operations pursuant to an agreement called a contract of work with the government of indonesia see “contracts of work” the contract of work allows us to conduct extensive mining production and exploration activities in a 24700acre area that we call block a which contains the grasberg mine and governs our rights and obligations relating to taxes exchange controls royalties repatriation and other matters the contract of work also allows us to explore for minerals in an approximately 500000 acre area that we call block b exploration activities in block b have been suspended since 2000 see “contracts of work” the term of our contract of work expires in 2021 but we can extend it for two 10year periods subject to indonesian government approval which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably

another of our operating subsidiaries pt irja eastern minerals which we refer to as eastern minerals holds an additional contract of work in papua covering approximately 12 million acres and conducts exploration activities which have been suspended since 2000 under this contract of work see “contracts of work” we have a 100 percent ownership interest in eastern minerals

in 1996 we established joint ventures with rio tinto plc which is an international mining company with headquarters in london england rio tinto conducts mining operations in north america south america asia europe and southern africa one of our joint ventures with rio tinto covers pt freeport indonesias mining operations in block a this joint venture gives rio tinto through 2021 a 40 percent interest in certain assets and in production above specified levels from operations in block a and after 2021 a 40 percent interest in all production in block a under our joint venture arrangements rio tinto also has a 40 percent interest in pt freeport indonesias contract of work and eastern minerals contract of work in addition rio tinto has the option to participate in 40 percent of any of our other future exploration projects in papua to date rio tinto has elected to participate in all exploration projects including pt nabire bakti mining rio tinto through one of its wholly owned subsidiaries owns approximately 12 percent of our currently outstanding common stock

under another joint venture agreement through pt nabire bakti mining we conduct exploration activities which have been suspended since 2000 see “contracts of work” in an area covering approximately 500000 acres in five parcels contiguous to pt freeport indonesias block b and one of eastern minerals blocks

at december 31 2003 pt freeport indonesias share of proven and probable recoverable reserves totaled 397 billion pounds of copper and 466 million ounces of gold all of which are located in block a our approximate 9064 percent equity share of those proven and probable recoverable reserves totaled 360 billion pounds of copper and 422 million ounces of gold see “ore reserves” in this annual report we refer to 1 aggregate reserves which means all reserves for the operations we manage 2 pt freeport indonesias share of reserves which means the reserves net of rio tintos interest under our joint venture arrangements and which are the reserves reported as those of our operations in our consolidated financial statements and 3 our equity share of reserves which means pt freeport indonesias share net of the 936 percent interest that the government of indonesia owns

in july 2003 we acquired the 857 percent ownership interest in pt puncakjaya power owned by affiliates of duke energy corporation puncakjaya power is the owner of assets supplying power to pt freeport indonesia’s operations including the 3x65 megawatt coalfired power facilities see “infrastructure”

we also smelt and refine copper concentrates in spain and market the refined copper products through our wholly owned subsidiary atlantic copper sa see investment in smelters in addition pt freeport indonesia has a 25 percent interest in pt smelting an indonesian company that operates a copper smelter and refinery in gresik indonesia these smelters play an important role in our concentrate marketing strategy as approximately onehalf of pt freeport indonesias concentrate production has been sold to atlantic copper and pt smelting over the last several years

contracts of work 

pt freeport indonesia and eastern minerals conduct their current exploration operations and pt freeport indonesia conducts its mining operations in indonesia by virtue of their contracts of work both contracts of work govern our rights and obligations relating to taxes exchange controls royalties repatriation and other matters both contracts of work were concluded pursuant to the 1967 foreign capital investment law which expresses indonesias foreign investment policy and provides basic guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization a framework for economic incentives and basic rules regarding other rights and obligations of foreign investors specifically the contracts of work provide that the government of indonesia will not nationalize or expropriate pt freeport indonesias or eastern minerals mining operations any disputes regarding the provisions of the contracts of work are subject to international arbitration we have experienced no disputes requiring arbitration during the 36 years we have operated in indonesia

pt freeport indonesias contract of work covers both block a which was first included in a 1967 contract of work that was replaced by a new contract of work in 1991 and block b to which we gained rights in 1991 the initial term of our contract of work expires in december 2021 but we can extend it for two 10year periods subject to indonesian government approval which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably we originally had the rights to explore 65 million acres in block b but pursuant to the contract of work we have only retained the rights to approximately 500000 acres which we believe following significant geological assessment contain the most promising exploration opportunities

eastern minerals signed its contract of work in august 1994 the contract of work originally covered approximately 25 million acres eastern minerals contract of work provides for a fourtoseven year exploratory term and a 30year term for mining operations subject to indonesian government approval which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably we can extend this period for two 10year periods eastern minerals’ contract of work requires us to relinquish our rights to 25 percent of the original 25millionacre contract of work area at the end of each of three specified periods as of december 31 2003 we had relinquished approximately 13 million acres and within three months of resuming exploratory activity under the contract of work we must relinquish approximately 06 million additional acres

in 2000 we suspended our exploration activities outside of block a because of safety and security issues and because of uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest areas covered by our contracts of work and an indonesian law enacted in 1999 prohibiting openpit mining in forest preservation areas in 2001 we requested and received from the government of indonesia formal temporary suspensions of our obligations under the contracts of work in all areas outside of block a the current suspensions were granted for oneyear periods ending february 26 2004 for block b march 31 2004 for pt nabire bakti mining and november 15 2004 for eastern minerals we are currently seeking renewal of the block b suspension and expect to continue to seek suspension renewals for additional oneyear periods by written request to the government of indonesia for each of the suspended areas if required we cannot predict when we will resume our exploration activities in these areas

pt freeport indonesia pays a copper royalty under its contact of work that varies from 15 percent of copper net revenue at a copper price of 090 or less per pound to 35 percent at a copper price of 110 or more per pound the contract of work royalty rate for gold and silver sales is 10 percent

a large part of the mineral royalties under government of indonesia regulations are designated to the provinces from which the minerals are extracted in connection with our fourth concentrator mill expansion pt freeport indonesia agreed to pay the government of indonesia voluntary additional royalties royalties not required by our contract of work to provide further support to the local governments and the people of papua pt freeport indonesia pays the additional royalties on metal from production above 200000 metric tons of ore per day the additional royalty for copper equals the contract of work royalty rate and for gold and silver equals twice the contract of work royalty rates therefore our royalty rate on copper net revenues from production above 200000 metric tons of ore per day is double the contract of work royalty rate and our royalty rates on gold and silver sales from production above 200000 metric tons of ore per day are triple the contract of work royalty rates the combined royalties including the voluntary additional royalties which became effective january 1 1999 totaled 265 million in 2003 245 million in 2002 and 243 million in 2001

republic of indonesia 

general the republic of indonesia consists of more than 17000 islands stretching 3000 miles along the equator from malaysia to australia and is the fourth most populous nation in the world with over 200 million people following many years of dutch colonial rule indonesia gained independence in 1945 and now has a presidential republic system of government

our mining complex was indonesias first copper mining project and was the first major foreign investment in indonesia following the economic development program instituted by the indonesian government in 1967 we work closely with the central provincial and local governments in development efforts in the area surrounding our operations we have had positive relations with the indonesian government since we commenced business activities in indonesia in 1967 and we intend to continue to maintain positive working relationships with the central provincial and local branches of the indonesian government

political developments in may 1998 president suharto indonesias political leader for more than 30 years resigned in the wake of an economic crisis in indonesia and other parts of southeast asia and in the face of growing social unrest vice president bj habibie succeeded suharto in june 1999 indonesia held a new parliamentary election on a generally peaceful basis as the first step in the process of electing a new president in october 1999 in accordance with the indonesian constitution the countrys highest political institution the peoples consultative assembly composed of the newly elected national parliament along with additional provincial and other representatives elected abdurrahman wahid as president and megawati sukarnoputri as vice president

there were repeated challenges to the political leadership of president wahid after his election in october 1999 in july 2001 the peoples consultative assembly voted to remove president wahid and elected vice president megawati sukarnoputri as the new president the international community including the united states expressed support for the president and her cabinet

recent developments president megawati and her cabinet marked their second anniversary in office during 2003 and have committed to continued efforts to restore the countrys economy and investor confidence progress in achieving these goals has been hindered by the global economic slowdown and issues internal to indonesia president megawati has supported the international communitys efforts to counter terrorism while addressing political complexities in indonesia the worlds largest muslim country the next presidential election is scheduled for july 2004

on august 31 2002 three people were killed and 11 others were wounded in an ambush by a group of unidentified assailants the assailants shot at several vehicles transporting international contract schoolteachers from pt freeport indonesia’s school in tembagapura their family members and other contractors to pt freeport indonesia on the road near tembagapura the mining town where the majority of pt freeport indonesias personnel reside the identity of the assailants remains unknown we along with the us government the central indonesian government the papuan provincial and local governments and leaders of the local people residing in the area of our operations condemned the attack indonesian authorities and the us federal bureau of investigation continue to investigate the incident and we are supporting and cooperating fully with these ongoing investigations

on october 12 2002 a bombing killed 202 people in the indonesian province of bali which is 1500 miles west of our mining and milling operations indonesian authorities arrested 35 people in connection with this bombing and 29 of those arrested have been tried and convicted on august 5 2003 12 people were killed and over 100 others were injured by a car bomb detonated outside of the jw marriott hotel in jakarta indonesia a terror suspect will stand trial in jakarta and face dual charges of involvement in this incident and the october 12 2002 bombing press reports state that indonesian police blame both attacks on international terrorist organizations our mining and milling operations were not interrupted by the august 31 2002 october 12 2002 or august 5 2003 incidents

the government of indonesia which provides security for pt freeport indonesias personnel and operations see “security matters” has expressed a strong commitment to protect natural resources businesses operating in indonesia including pt freeport indonesia with heightened security following the incidents discussed above

economic and social conditions the indonesian economy grew by an estimated 4 percent in 2003 and 2002 and an estimated 3 percent in 2001 indonesia is asias second largest exporter of oil and has benefited from higher oil prices in recent years 

after beginning the year at 8940 rupiah to one us dollar the indonesian currency averaged approximately 8500 rupiah to one us dollar during 2003 and closed at 8437 rupiah to one us dollar on december 31 2003 the stronger rupiah reflects the economic progress made by president megawatis administration and weakness in the us dollar

despite gradual improvements on the economic front indonesias recovery remains vulnerable to ongoing political and social tensions incidents of violence and separatist pressures continue to be reported proindependence movements in certain areas continue to be prominent especially in the province of aceh where the indonesian government signed a peace agreement with separatists in december 2002 and to a lesser extent in papua the area surrounding our mining development is sparsely populated by local people and former residents of more populous areas of indonesia some of whom have resettled in papua under the government of indonesias transmigration program a segment of the local population is opposing indonesian rule over papua and several separatist groups have sought political independence for the province in addition to the august 31 2002 shooting incident there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the indonesian military in papua

while the uncertainties of the regional autonomy process have created concern among foreign investors the indonesian government has repeatedly assured investors that existing contracts would be honored government officials have publicly stated that the government of indonesia will honor existing contracts and that they have no intention of revoking or unilaterally amending such contracts specifically including pt freeport indonesias contract of work our belief that our contracts of work will continue to be honored is further supported by us laws which prohibit us aid to countries that nationalize property owned by or take steps to nullify a contract with a us citizen or company at least 50 percent owned by us citizens if the foreign country does not within a reasonable time take appropriate steps to provide full value compensation or other relief under international law

our investment in indonesia and papua we have a boardapproved policy statement on social employment and human rights and have comprehensive and extensive social cultural and community development programs to which we have committed significant financial and managerial resources these policies and programs are designed to address the impact of our operations on the local villages and people and to provide assistance for the development of the local people while we believe these efforts should serve to avoid damage to and disruptions of our mining operations our operations could be damaged or disrupted by social economic and political forces beyond our control

pt freeport indonesia contributes to the economies of papua and the republic of indonesia through the payment of taxes dividends and royalties voluntary economic development programs infrastructure development employment and the purchase of local and national goods in fact pt freeport indonesia has frequently been one of the largest taxpayers in the republic of indonesia in addition it pays royalties on all minerals removed from the ground

moreover since it began development activities more than thirtyfive years ago pt freeport indonesia has made significant investments in infrastructure both for its use and for use by the papuan public these infrastructure improvements include medical facilities roads an airport and heliports schools housing community buildings and places of worship

pt freeport indonesia is also one of the largest private employers in indonesia and by far the largest in papua as of december 31 2003 pt freeport indonesia directly employed 7802 people and 6054 contract workers provided services to pt freeport indonesia in addition 4436 persons worked for privatized companies providing services within pt freeport indonesias operations area

besides the estimated 23 billion paid in direct benefits to the indonesian government under the contract of work from 1992 through 2003 pt freeport indonesias operations have provided another 87 billion during this period in indirect benefits to papua and the republic of indonesia in the form of wages and benefits paid to workers purchases of goods and services charitable contributions and reinvestments in operations

ore reserves 

during 2003 additions to the aggregate proven and probable reserves of the grasberg and other block a ore bodies totaled approximately 1855 million metric tons of ore representing increases of 26 billion recoverable pounds of copper 10 million recoverable ounces of gold and 168 million recoverable ounces of silver approximately 126 million metric tons of the additions relate to additions to the mill level zone ore body resulting from pt freeport indonesia’s 2003 drilling program yearend aggregate proven and probable recoverable reserves net of 2003 production were 27 billion metric tons of ore averaging 108 percent copper 098 grams per metric ton gt of gold and 372 gt of silver representing 544 billion pounds of copper 604 million ounces of gold and 1594 million ounces of silver our aggregate exploration budget for 2004 including rio tinto’s share is expected to total approximately 13 million with most of the effort focused on drilling below the current mill level zone ore body 

pursuant to joint venture arrangements between pt freeport indonesia and rio tinto rio tinto has a 40 percent interest in production from reserves above those reported at december 31 1994 net of rio tinto’s share pt freeport indonesias share of proven and probable recoverable copper gold and silver reserves was 397 billion pounds of copper 466 million ounces of gold and 1168 million ounces of silver as of december 31 2003 fcxs equity interest in proven and probable recoverable reserves as of december 31 2003 was 360 billion pounds of copper 422 million ounces of gold and 1059 million ounces of silver we estimated recoverable reserves using an average copper price of 085 per pound and an average gold price of 270 per ounce with respect to the proven and probable reserves presented below if metal prices were adjusted to the approximate average london spot prices for the past three years ie copper prices adjusted from 085 per pound to 074 per pound and gold prices adjusted from 270 per ounce to 315 per ounce there would be no change in our proven and probable reserves

all of our proven and probable recoverable reserves lie within block a the grasberg deposit contains the largest single gold reserve and is one of the largest copper reserves of any mine in the world aggregate grasberg open pit and underground proven and probable recoverable ore reserves as of december 31 2003 are shown below along with those of our other deposits reserve calculations were prepared by our employees under the supervision of george macdonald our vice president of exploration and were reviewed and verified by independent mining consultants inc experts in mining geology and reserve determination see risk factors we developed our current mine plan based on completing the mining of all of our currently designated recoverable reserves before the end of 2041 which would be the expiration of our contract of work including two 10year extensions prior to the expiration of the initial term of our contract of work in december 2021 under our current mine plan we expect to mine approximately 48 percent of aggregate proven and probable ore representing approximately 62 percent of pt freeport indonesias share of recoverable copper reserves and approximately 72 percent of pt freeport indonesias share of recoverable gold reserves

 

  

 a

ore reserve tonnage estimates are after application of applicable mining recovery factors

b

proven and probable recoverable reserves represent estimated metal quantities from which we expect to be paid after application of estimated mill recovery rates and smelter recovery rates of 965 percent for copper 970 percent for gold and 769 percent for silver the term “recoverable reserve” means that part of a mineral deposit which we estimate can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination

the following table sets forth the average drill hole spacing for each of our ore bodies drill hole spacing data is used by mining professionals such as mining engineers in determining the suitability of data coverage on a relative basis in a given deposit type and mining method scenario so as to achieve a given level of confidence in the resource estimate drill hole spacing is only one of several criteria necessary to establish confidence level for resource classification drilling programs are typically designed to achieve an optimum sample spacing to support the level of confidence in results that fit a particular stage of development of a mineral deposit we calculated the average drill hole spacing within each ore body using the distance from the center of each block in the resource model to the nearest drill hole composite we then calculated the averages of these values within the volume of each ore body and report them under the column entitled average distance to nearest sample this value represents at least onehalf of the average drill hole spacing within each deposit we calculated the value under the column entitled average distance between drill holes by multiplying the average minimum distance value by two and this value represents the maximum average drill hole spacing 

 mining operations 

we and our predecessors have conducted exploration and mining operations in block a since 1967 and have been the only operator of those operations following are descriptions of ore mines in production significant ore mines in development and our ore bodies

mines in production we currently have two mines in operation the grasberg open pit and the deep ore zone as of december 31 2003 our capital expenditures incurred to date for our mining operations in indonesia totaled 49 billion our mine development expansion and infrastructure capital expenditures totaled approximately 48 million in 2003 69 million in 2002 and 84 million in 2001 these expenditures primarily relate to development of the deep ore zone ore body we began openpit mining of the grasberg ore body in january 1990 production is at the 3520to 4250meter elevation level and totaled 574 million metric tons of ore in 2003 and 710 million metric tons of ore in 2002 which provided 77 percent of our 2003 mill feed and 83 percent of our 2002 mill feed the underground grasberg reserves will be mined using the blockcave method near the end of openpit mining which is expected to continue until approximately 2015

the deep ore zone ore body lies vertically below the intermediate ore zone we began production from the deep ore zone ore body in 1989 but we suspended production in 1991 in favor of production from the grasberg deposit production using the blockcave method at the deep ore zone restarted in september 2000 production is at the 3150meter elevation level and totaled 148 million metric tons of ore in 2003 and 79 million metric tons of ore in 2002 the deep ore zone performed above design capacity of 35000 metric tons of ore per day and studies are ongoing to evaluate additional lowcost expansion options to increase production production from the deep ore zone averaged 40500 metric tons of ore per day in 2003 

the intermediate ore zone was an underground blockcave operation that began production in the first half of 1994 production totaled 25 million metric tons of ore in 2003 and 71 million metric tons of ore in 2002 the intermediate ore zone was depleted during the third quarter of 2003 during its 10year life the intermediate ore zone operation produced almost 30 percent more copper and gold than the initial reserve estimates

our principal source of power for all our operations is a coalfired power plant that we built in conjunction with our fourth concentrator expansion see “infrastructure improvements” mediumspeed diesel generators supply peaking and backup power a combination of naturally occurring mountain streams and water derived from our underground operations provides water for our operations the average annual rainfall in the project area is 180 inches

mines in development five other significant ore bodies referred to as the kucing liar mill level zone ertsberg stockwork zone big gossan and the dom are located in block a these ore bodies are at various stages of development and are included in our proven and probable recoverable reserves we incurred 36 million for mine development expansion and infrastructure capital expenditures related to these ore bodies during the three years ended december 31 2003 see “risk factors”

the kucing liar ore body lies on the southern flank of and underneath the southern portion of the grasberg open pit at the 2500 to 3100meter elevation level we are reviewing development plans for kucing liar

the mill level zone ore body lies directly below the deep ore zone mine at the 2900meter elevation this ore represents the downward continuation of mineralization in the ertsberg east skarn system and neighboring ertsberg porphyry drilling efforts continue to determine the extent of this ore body which we expect to mine using a blockcave method after we complete mining at the deep ore zone ore body

the ertsberg stockwork zone ore body extends off the southwest side of the deep ore zone ore body at the 3150 to 3750meter elevation level drilling efforts continue to determine the extent of this ore body which we expect to mine using a blockcave method after we complete mining at the deep ore zone ore body

the big gossan ore body is located approximately 1000 meters southwest of the original ertsberg openpit deposit we began the initial underground development of the ore body in 1993 when we drove tunnels from the mill area into the ore zone at the 3000meter elevation level a stope and fill mining method will be used on the big gossan deposit a feasibility study and an update to the sitewide development plan will be completed in 2004 to determine when to begin production

the dom ore body lies approximately 1500 meters southeast of the depleted ertsberg openpit deposit we completed preproduction development at the dom including all maintenance warehouse and service facilities just as the grasberg mine began openpit production in 1990 we have deferred production at the dom ore body and may not reinitiate until after completion of openpit mining at grasberg

the projected aggregate capital expenditures required to reach full production capacity for each of our undeveloped ore bodies based on our latest mine plans and our proven and probable recoverable reserves as of december 31 2003 are shown below in millions actual costs could differ materially from these estimates as we will not incur most of the expenditures for several years and we will incur them over a period of several years based on our current estimates we expect these expenditures to average between 35 million and 215 million annually during the next 15 years in addition these costs will be shared with rio tinto in accordance with our joint venture agreement 

 

description of ore bodies our ore bodies are located within and around two main igneous intrusions the grasberg monzodiorite and the ertsberg diorite the host rocks of these ore bodies include both carbonate and clastic rocks that form the ridge crests and upper flanks of the sudirman range and the igneous rocks of monzonitic to dioritic composition that intrude them the igneoushosted ore bodies the grasberg open pit and block cave and the ertsberg stockwork zone block cave occur as vein stockworks and disseminations of copper sulphides dominated by chalcopyrite and to a much lesser extent bornite the sedimentaryrock hosted ore bodies occur as magnetiterich calciummagnesian skarn replacements whose location and orientation are strongly influenced by major faults and by the chemistry of the carbonate rocks along the margins of the intrusions

the copper mineralization in these skarn deposits is also dominated by chalcopyrite but higher bornite concentrations are common moreover gold occurs in significant concentrations in all of the districts ore bodies though rarely visible to the naked eye these gold concentrations usually occur as inclusions within the copper sulphide minerals though in some deposits these concentrations can also be strongly associated with pyrite

 

the following diagram indicates the relative elevations in meters of our reported reserve ore bodies

 

the following map which encompasses an area of approximately 42 square kilometers approximately 16 square miles indicates the relative positions and sizes of our reported reserve ore bodies and their locations

  

the following chart illustrates our current plans for sequencing and producing each of our ore bodies and the years in which we currently expect that production of each ore body will begin and end production volumes are typically lower in the first few years of each ore body as development activities are ongoing and as the mine ramps up to full production currently the grasberg open pit and deep ore zone are our only producing mines the ultimate timing of the start of production from our undeveloped mines is dependent upon a number of factors including the results of our exploration efforts and may vary from the dates shown below

 

during 2003 we mined an average of 598800 metric tons of material per day including ore and overburden and we do not require any additional approvals for higher rates during 2002 we mined an average of 704900 metric tons of material per day the decrease in 2003 production levels is due to the fourth quarter slippage and debris flow events that occurred in a section of the grasberg open pit we expect to return to normal production levels in the second quarter of 2004 see “grasberg open pit slippage” the following chart illustrates our current aggregate mill capacity our aggregate permitted mill capacity and our projected milling rates the decline in milling rates in 2015 reflects the expected completion date of openpit mining at the grasberg ore body we are continuing to develop mine plans to optimize production levels and to offset the anticipated decline in 2015

 

 

milling and production 

the ore from our mines moves by a conveyor system to a series of shafts through which it drops to our milling and concentrating complex located approximately 2900 meters above sea level at the mill the ore is crushed and ground and mixed in tanks with water and small amounts of flotation reagents where it is continuously agitated with air during this physical separation process copper gold and silverbearing particles rise to the top of the tanks and are collected and thickened into a concentrate the concentrate leaves the mill complex as a slurry consisting of approximately 65 percent solids by weight and is pumped through three parallel 115kilometer pipelines to our coastal port site facility at amamapare where it is filtered dried and stored for shipping ships are loaded at dock facilities at the port until they draw their maximum dockside water and they then move to deeper water where loading is completed from shuttling barges

 

our production results for the last three years are as follows

 

a

includes site production and delivery costs smelting and refining costs and royalties less credits for gold and silver sales

mill throughput averaged 203000 metric tons of ore per day during 2003 32600 metric tons per day lower than the 235600 metric tons of ore per day during 2002 in october 2003 a slippage of material occurred in a section of the grasberg open pit the area affected by the slippage included two active mining areas which were scheduled to be mined in the fourth quarter of 2003 pt freeport indonesia does not expect the grasberg slippage to affect longterm mine plans see “grasberg open pit slippage” 

copper production for 2003 was 13 billion pounds 2326 million pounds lower than that for 2002 primarily because of lower average copper ore grades and lower mill throughput caused by the slippage and debris flow events gold production for 2003 was 166500 ounces higher than that for 2002 primarily because of higher average gold grades

average net cash production costs per pound of copper of a net credit of 002 for 2003 were an annual record low compared with 008 for 2002 higher gold credits in 2003 offset higher site production and delivery costs average net cash production costs were higher for the year 2002 compared with 2001 primarily because of lower gold credits our average net cash production costs per pound of copper vary with the amount of gold we sell and gold prices among other factors once we complete our openpit mining operations at the grasberg mine by approximately 2015 and transition to underground we expect our share of annual copper and gold production to be lower than current levels and all other factors being equal our average net cash production costs to increase for more information regarding our operating and financial results see “item 6 selected financial data” and “items 7 and 7a management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks”

grasberg open pit slippage 

on october 9 2003 a slippage of material occurred in a section of the grasberg open pit eight workers perished and five workers were injured in the incident the area affected by the slippage comprising approximately five percent of the surface area of the massive grasberg pit included two active mining areas that were scheduled to be mined in 2003 and 2004 on december 12 2003 a debris flow involving a relatively small amount of loose material occurred in the same area of the grasberg open pit resulting in only minor property damage following these two events pt freeport indonesia redirected its openpit operations to accelerate removal of waste material from the south wall to restore safe access to the higher grade ore areas in the pit these activities have resulted in reduced production levels ore previously forecast to be mined in 2004 is currently available for mining and will be mined once safe access is assured based on the substantial progress achieved to date pt freeport indonesia expects to return to its key ore areas in the second quarter of 2004 

as a result of the fourth quarter slippage and debris flow events pt freeport indonesia notified its copper concentrate customers that it was declaring force majeure under the terms of its contracts as it would be unable to satisfy its annual sales and delivery commitments under those contracts a declaration of force majeure allows pt freeport indonesia to cancel reduce or delay the sale and delivery of concentrates to its customers during the affected period caused by an event of force majeure pt freeport indonesia is working with its customers to keep them apprised of the timing of the expected return to normal operations and concentrate deliveries

in the near term pt freeport indonesia’s ore is expected to be limited to its deep ore zone underground mine and low grade material from the open pit as a result of the mine sequencing changes at the open pit a portion of the higher grade ore previously forecast to be mined in 2004 is expected to be deferred to future periods with the substantial majority of the deferred ore expected to be mined in 2005 these mine sequencing changes are not expected to affect longterm mine plans or recoverable ore reserves our 2004 annual sales are expected to approximate 10 billion pounds of copper and 15 million ounces of gold with a significant portion expected in the second half and 15 billion pounds of copper and 29 million ounces of gold in 2005

pt freeport indonesia maintains property damage and business interruption insurance related to its operations we have notified our insurers that we will be presenting a claim and are in the process of quantifying the extent of our losses from the october 9 and december 12 events any losses covered by insurance would be subject to a deductible of approximately 40 million and any insurance recovery will depend on several factors such as the extent of business interruption losses on a daily basis the time period during which our production is constrained the condition of the equipment that was damaged and the costs associated with the recovery and cleanup operations no assurance can be provided at this time about the extent to which our losses will be covered by insurance

as a result of our joint venture arrangements rio tinto generally pays for 40 percent of our joint venture exploration and exploratory drilling costs in papua the joint ventures incurred total exploration costs of 105 million in 2003 and 48 million in 2002 the joint ventures exploration budget for 2004 totals approximately 13 million with most of the effort focused on drilling below the current mill level zone ore body

in june 1998 we entered into a joint venture agreement to conduct exploration activities in pt nabire bakti minings contract of work area which currently covers approximately 500000 acres in several blocks contiguous to pt freeport indonesias block b and one of eastern minerals blocks in papua rio tinto shares in 40 percent of our interest and costs in this exploration joint venture we and rio tinto can earn up to a 62 percent interest in the pt nabire bakti mining contract of work by spending up to 21 million on exploration and other activities in the joint venture areas we have spent 165 million through december 31 2003

with the subsequent approval of the indonesian government in 2000 we temporarily suspended our field exploration activities in block b which includes the wabu ridge gold prospect as well as in the other contract of work areas of eastern minerals and pt nabire bakti mining the suspensions are due to safety and security issues and uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest areas covered by the contracts of work and an indonesian law enacted in 1999 prohibiting openpit mining in forest preservation areas we cannot predict when we will be able to resume our exploration activities in these areas we expect to continue to seek renewals of these suspensions for each of the suspended areas if required all of the suspended areas are outside of our current mining operations area

infrastructure 

the location of our mining operations in a remote area requires that our operations be virtually selfsufficient in addition to the mining facilities described above in the course of the development of our project we have constructed ourselves or participated with others in the construction of an airport a port a 119 kilometer road an aerial tramway two hospitals and related medical facilities and two town sites with housing schools and other facilities sufficient to support more than 17000 persons

in 1996 we completed a significant infrastructure program which includes various residential community and commercial facilities we designed the program to provide the infrastructure needed for our operations to enhance the living conditions of our employees and to develop and promote the growth of local and other third party activities and enterprises in papua we have developed the facilities through joint ventures or direct ownership involving local indonesian interests and other investors

in july 2003 we acquired the 857 percent ownership interest in puncakjaya power owned by affiliates of duke energy corporation for 681 million cash net of 99 million of cash acquired puncakjaya power is the owner of assets supplying power to pt freeport indonesia’s operations including the 3x65 megawatt coalfired power facilities pt freeport indonesia purchases power from puncakjaya power under infrastructure asset financing arrangements at december 31 2003 pt freeport indonesia had infrastructure asset financing obligations to puncakjaya power totaling 2955 million as a result of this transaction our consolidated balance sheet no longer reflects pt freeport indonesia’s obligation to puncakjaya power but instead reflects the puncakjaya power bank debt which totaled 2355 million and a receivable from rio tinto totaling 839 million for its share of the obligation to puncakjaya power at december 31 2003 

marketing 

pt freeport indonesia sells its copper concentrates which contain significant quantities of gold and silver under united states dollardenominated sales agreements mostly to companies in asia and europe and to international trading companies we sell substantially all of our budgeted production of copper concentrates under longterm contracts with selling prices based on world metals prices generally the london metal exchange settlement prices for grade a copper under these contracts initial billing occurs at the time of shipment and final settlement on the copper portion is generally based on average prices for a specified future period gold generally is sold at the average london bullion market association price for a specified month near the month of shipment

revenues from concentrate sales are recorded net of royalties see contracts of work treatment and all refining charges including participation charges if applicable based on the market prices of metals and the impact of derivative financial instruments if any used to hedge against risks from metals price fluctuations moreover because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrates is unrecoverable as a result of the smelting process our revenues from concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances based on the quantity and value of these unrecoverable metals these allowances are a negotiated term of our contracts and vary by customer treatment and refining charges represent payments to smelters and refiners and are either fixed or in certain cases vary with the price of copper we sell a small amount of copper concentrates in the spot market see risk factors

we have commitments including commitments from atlantic copper and pt smelting for essentially all of our estimated 2004 production we estimate our share of sales for 2004 to approximate 10 billion pounds of copper and 15 million ounces of gold projected 2004 copper and gold sales reflect the expectation of lower production during the first half of 2004 because of our efforts to restore safe access to highgrade areas in the grasberg open pit with higher sales projected in 2005 see risk factors

pt freeport indonesia has a longterm contract through 2007 to provide atlantic copper with a quantity of copper concentrates at market prices which currently approximates 60 percent of atlantic copper’s annual copper concentrate requirements pt freeport indonesias agreement with pt smelting provides for the life of pt freeport indonesias mines for the supply of 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements necessary to produce 205000 metric tons of copper essentially the gresik smelter’s original design capacity on a priority basis pt freeport indonesia has also entered into a separate agreement to provide pt smelting with an incremental supply of copper concentrates at market prices for the majority of pt smelting’s additional requirements through 2004 for the first 15 years of pt smeltings operations beginning in december 1998 the treatment and refining charges on the majority of the concentrate pt freeport indonesia supplies will not fall below a specified minimum rate currently 023 per pound which has been the rate since pt smelting began operating in 1998 the rate is scheduled to decline to a floor of 021 per pound in early 2004 we anticipate that pt freeport indonesia will sell approximately 50 percent of its annual concentrate production to atlantic copper and pt smelting a recap of pt freeport indonesias aggregate percentage concentrate sales to its affiliates and to other parties for the last three years follows

 

investment in smelters 

our investment in smelters atlantic copper and pt smelting serves an important role in our concentrate marketing strategy pt freeport indonesia generally sells approximately onehalf of its concentrate production to its affiliated smelters atlantic copper and pt smelting and the remainder to other customers treatment charges for smelting and refining copper concentrates represent a cost to pt freeport indonesia and income to atlantic copper and pt smelting through downstream integration we are assured placement of a significant portion of our concentrate production and operating hedges for treatment and refining charges while currently low smelting and refining charges have adversely affected the operating results of atlantic copper these low charges have benefited the operating results to pt freeport indonesias mining operations

atlantic copper sa we own 100 percent of atlantic copper atlantic copper completed the last expansion of its production capacity in 1997 and its smelter currently has a design capacity of 290000 metric tons of copper per year we have no present plans to expand atlantic coppers production capacity during 2003 atlantic copper treated 964400 metric tons of concentrate and scrap and produced 290300 metric tons of new copper anodes during 2002 atlantic copper treated a record 1016700 metric tons of concentrate and scrap and produced 298000 metric tons of new copper anodes atlantic copper is planning a 45day major maintenance turnaround in the second quarter of 2004 major maintenance turnarounds of this duration typically occur approximately every nine years for atlantic copper with significantly shorter term maintenance turnarounds occurring in the interim atlantic copper purchased approximately 61 percent of its 2003 concentrate requirements from pt freeport indonesia at market prices atlantic copper has experienced no material operating problems and we are not aware of any potential material environmental liabilities at atlantic copper

we contributed 100 million to atlantic copper in 2003 250 million in 2002 and 76 million in 2001 and we expect to make significant additional contributions in 2004 the funds are intended to strengthen atlantic coppers financial structure during this period of extremely low treatment and refining charge rates which have negatively affected atlantic coppers results we are reviewing the cost structure of atlantic copper and continue to assess means of improving its financial performance our total investment in atlantic copper through december 31 2003 was 2549 million

pt smelting pt freeport indonesias contract of work required us to construct or cause to be constructed a smelter in indonesia if we and the indonesian government determined that such a project would be economically viable in 1995 following the completion of a feasibility study we entered into agreements relating to the formation of pt smelting and the construction of the copper smelter in gresik indonesia

pt smelting is a joint venture among pt freeport indonesia mitsubishi materials corporation mitsubishi corporation and nippon mining  metals co ltd which own 25 percent 605 percent 95 percent and 5 percent respectively of the outstanding pt smelting common stock in accordance with the joint venture agreements pt freeport indonesia provides nearly all of pt smeltings copper concentrate requirements in december 2003 pt smelting’s shareholder agreement was amended to eliminate pt freeport indonesia’s assignment of its earnings in pt smelting to support a 13 percent cumulative annual return to the other owners for the first 20 years of operations no amounts were paid under this assignment pt freeport indonesias total investment in pt smelting through december 31 2003 was 973 million

during 2003 pt smelting treated 824800 metric tons of concentrate and produced 247400 metric tons of new copper anodes during 2002 pt smelting treated 719600 metric tons of concentrate and produced 211200 metric tons of new copper anodes pt smelting is planning a 33day major maintenance turnaround in the first half of 2004 major maintenance turnarounds of this duration typically occur approximately every four years for pt smelting with significantly shorter term maintenance turnarounds in the interim pt smelting has no present plans to expand its treatment capacity and has experienced no material operating problems we are not aware of any potential material environmental liabilities at pt smelting

competition 

we compete with other mining companies in the sale of our mineral concentrates and the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel some competing companies possess financial resources greater than ours and possess multiple mining assets less geographically concentrated in a single area than ours we believe however that we are one of the lowest cost copper producers in the world which gives us a significant competitive advantage

social development employment and human rights 

we have a social employment and human rights policy designed to result in our operating in compliance with the laws in the areas of our operations and in a manner that respects basic human rights and the culture of the people who are indigenous to the area we continue to incur significant costs on social and cultural activities primarily in papua these activities include

 

 comprehensive job training programs 

 basic education programs 

 several public health programs including extensive malaria control 

 agricultural assistance programs 

 a business incubator program to encourage the local people to establish their own small scale businesses 

 cultural preservation programs and 

 charitable donations 

 

in 1996 pt freeport indonesia agreed to commit at least one percent of its revenues for the subsequent 10 years to the freeport partnership fund for community development formerly the freeport fund for irian jaya development to support villagebased health education economic and social development programs in its area of operations this commitment replaced our community development programs in which we spent a similar amount of money each year our contributions totaled 174 million in 2003 152 million in 2002 and 141 million in 2001 to the freeport partnership fund for community development

lembaga pembangunan masyarakat amungme kamoro lpmak oversees disbursement of the funds we contribute to the fund lpmaks board of commissioners is made up of a leader of the amungme people a leader of the kamoro people leaders of the three local churches a representative of the local government and a representative of pt freeport indonesia

we believe that our social and economic development programs are responsive to the issues raised by the local villages and people and should help us to avoid disruptions of mining operations nevertheless social and political instability in the area may adversely impact our mining operations see risk factors

in december 2000 we endorsed the joint us state departmentbritish foreign office voluntary principles on human rights and security several major natural resources companies and important human rights organizations also endorsed the voluntary principles we participated in drafting these principles with all of the parties involved and incorporated them into our social and human rights policy

security matters 

consistent with our contract of work and duty to protect our employees and property we have taken appropriate steps to provide a safe and secure working environment as part of its security program pt freeport indonesia maintains its own internal security department which performs functions such as protecting company facilities monitoring the shipment of company goods through the airport and terminal assisting in traffic control and aiding rescue operations pt freeport indonesias civilian security employees numbering about 670 are unarmed and perform duties consistent with their internal security role pt freeport indonesias share of costs for its internal civilian security department totaled 112 million for 2003 77 million for 2002 and 68 million for 2001 the security department has received human rights training and each member is required to certify his or her compliance with our human rights policy

pt freeport indonesia and all businesses and residents of indonesia relies on the government of indonesia for the provision of public order upholding the rule of law and the protection of personnel and property the grasberg mine has been designated by the government of indonesia as one of indonesias vital national assets this designation results in the military’s playing a significant role in protecting the area of our operations the government of indonesia is responsible for employing police and military personnel and directing their operations

from the outset of pt freeport indonesia’s operations the government has looked to pt freeport indonesia to provide logistical and infrastructure support and assistance for these necessary services because of the limited resources of the indonesian government and the remote location of and lack of development in papua pt freeport indonesia’s financial support for the indonesian government security institutions assigned to the operations area represents a prudent response to its requirements to protect its workforce and property better ensuring that personnel are properly fed and lodged and have the logistical resources to patrol pt freeport indonesia’s roads and secure its operating area in addition provision of such support and oversight is consistent with pt freeport indonesia’s obligations under the contract of work reflects our philosophy of responsible corporate citizenship and is in keeping with our commitment to pursue practices that will promote human rights which include our endorsement of the joint us state departmentbritish foreign office voluntary principles on human rights and security

pt freeport indonesias share of support costs for the governmentprovided security involving over 2300 indonesian government security personnel currently located in the general area of our operations was 59 million for 2003 56 million for 2002 and 47 million for 2001 this supplemental support consists of various infrastructure and other costs such as food housing fuel travel vehicle repairs allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs and community assistance programs conducted by the militarypolice pt freeport indonesias capital costs for associated infrastructure was 06 million for 2003 04 million for 2002 and 05 million in 2001 

environmental matters 

we have an environmental policy that commits us not only to compliance with applicable federal state and local environmental statutes and regulations but also to continuous improvement of our environmental performance at every operational site we believe that we conduct our indonesian operations pursuant to all necessary permits and are in compliance in all material respects with applicable indonesian environmental laws rules and regulations

mining operations on the scale of our operations in papua involve significant environmental challenges primarily related to the disposition of tailings which are the crushed and ground rock material resulting from the physical separation of commercially valuable minerals from the ore we have comprehensive ongoing environmental management and monitoring plans for the disposal of tailings resulting from our milling operations which the government of indonesia has approved pursuant to these plans we manage and monitor the impact of our tailings disposal on the ecosystem of the ajkwa river and the ecosystems of adjoining water bodies and the surrounding coastal areas in 1997 we completed an engineered levee system to minimize the impact of the tailings through a controlled deposition area located on a portion of the flood plain on the ajkwa river we will revegetate and reclaim the modified ajkwa deposition area when our mining operations are completed

in furtherance of our commitments to the indonesian government pursuant to our tailings management plan we monitor the acidneutralizing capacity of tailings on a daily basis to ensure the discharge of nonacid generating tailings into our tailings deposition area the net acidneutralizing capacity of our tailings discharge is maintained through a managed program of blending underground ore with ore from the open pit the addition of supplemental limestone or lime to the ore blend and the addition of lime for control of the ph levels in the flotation system daily samples are collected and tested and this data is communicated to our mill operations so that adjustments in ore blending and limelimestone addition can be made as appropriate

with respect to overburden acid rock drainage generation is our primary environmental issue our approaches to this issue include the prevention of acid rock drainage generation the control of acid rock drainage migration and the capture and treatment of acid rock drainage emanating from the overburden stockpile in addition tests have shown the feasibility of revegetating the overburden stockpile and as a result we have engaged in stockpile reclamation as an additional means of mitigating acid rock drainage 

we have made significant capital expenditures with respect to the capture and treatment of acid rock drainage and additional capital expenditures are currently in progress in addition we are in the process of developing and implementing technology for the treatment of captured acid rock drainage in the interim acid rock drainage collected by boreholes near the base of the overburden stockpile is neutralized

we have also committed to the indonesian government to have independent external environmental audits of our papuan operations performed by qualified experts every three years with the results to be made public we have had three independent environmental audits conducted by internationally recognized consulting and auditing firms sgs international certification services indonesia a member of the société générale de surveillance group completed the 2002 environmental audit the 2002 audit found that the overall approach to practical management of environmental issues at pt freeport indonesia is considered to be very sound there were no audit findings requiring corrective action we also are continuing our annual internal audits through the life of our mining operations so that our environmental management and monitoring programs will remain sound and our operations will remain in material compliance with local laws

in connection with obtaining our environmental approvals from the indonesian government we committed to performing a onetime environmental risk assessment on the impacts of our tailings management plan we completed this extensive environmental risk assessment with more than 90 scientific studies conducted over four years and submitted it to the indonesian government in december 2002 we developed the risk assessment plan with input from an independent review panel which included representatives from the indonesian government academia and nongovernmental organizations the risks that we identified during this process were in line with our impact projections of the tailings management program contained in our environmental approval documents

we have environmental approvals from the government of indonesia to expand our milling rate up to a maximum of 300000 metric tons of ore per day in 2003 we averaged 203000 metric tons of ore per day and in 2002 we averaged 235600 metric tons of ore per day

the cost of complying with environmental laws is a fundamental cost of our business we incurred aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs totaling 721 million in 2003 626 million in 2002 and 782 million in 2001 including tailings management levee maintenance and mine reclamation in 2004 we expect to incur approximately 11 million of aggregate environmental capital expenditures and 43 million of other environmental costs these environmental expenditures are part of our overall 2004 operating budget

we are currently revegetating portions of the affected areas of the tailings deposition area upon the completion of our mining operations we will fulfill the remaining commitments we made to the indonesian government in connection with our tailings management plan our options for revegetation of affected areas of the deposition area include forage crops and grasses fruits grains and vegetables and other traditional food and medicinal crops decisions on these options are made after consultation with local and regional government and local residents in addition to the revegetation and reclamation of the deposition area we will continue to operate our wastewater treatment plants as long as necessary we will also monitor and test the water discharged from our mine and the ph sulfate and electrical conductivity levels of ground water in the deposition area in addition we will provide flood protection to surrounding areas by diverting the ajkwa and otomona rivers and enhancing levee embankments the stability of our levees will be ensured through periodic visual inspection revegetation of the levee embankments and the transfer of our levee roads for public use moreover we will submit an annual written report to the indonesian government regarding our reclamation activities

our ultimate reclamation and closure activities will be determined after consultation with the indonesian government affected local residents and other affected parties our best estimate is that pt freeport indonesias total aggregate reclamation and closure obligations totaled approximately 130 million as of december 31 2003 estimates of reclamation and closure costs involve complex issues requiring integrated assessments over a period of many years and we may revise them as we perform more complete studies some reclamation costs will be incurred during mining activities while most closure costs and the remaining reclamation costs will be incurred at the end of mining activities which are currently estimated to continue for more than 30 years

moreover we cannot predict with any certainty the ultimate future uses of the tailings deposition area once our mining operations are completed in addition to forage crop and grass planting and food and medicinal crop production possible future uses of the tailings deposition area include rainforest production production of timber fuel woods fruits and nuts and other economic forestry and the cultivation of fish shellfish and other aquaculture the ultimate future uses will be determined after consultation with local and regional government and local residents

in 1996 we began contributing to a cash fund 50 million balance at december 31 2003 designed to accumulate at least 100 million by the end of our indonesian mining activities we plan to use this fund including accrued interest to pay for mine closure and reclamation costs any incremental costs in excess of this 100 million fund are expected to be incurred throughout the life of the mine and would be funded by operational cash flow or other sources an increasing emphasis on environmental issues and future changes in regulations could require us to incur additional costs that would be charged against future operations estimates involving environmental matters are by their nature imprecise and changes in government regulations operations technology and inflation could require us to revise them over time

in 1998 a court in huelva spain found an employee of atlantic copper guilty of a criminal offense against the environment in connection with atlantic coppers transportation and use of weak acid and spent electrolyte at a facility owned and operated by minas de rio tinto sal the court fined the employee approximately 48000 the huelva court ruling did not prohibit atlantic coppers huelva complex from continuing to engage in these operations moreover atlantic coppers weak acid and spent electrolyte transport and use operations have been authorized by spanish environmental regulators atlantic copper has voluntarily constructed an onsite plant for the treatment of weak acid and recycling of spent electrolyte since june 2001 no weak acid or spent electrolyte has been sent to the minas de rio tinto facilities

we believe that atlantic coppers facilities and operations are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable spanish environmental laws rules and regulations however in july 2002 the integrated pollution prevention and control guidelines were adopted under spanish law with a phase in for compliance by 2007 atlantic copper working with local environmental authorities is continually assessing the impact of these new guidelines on its operations and has budgeted approximately 30 million as its best estimate of the required capital expenditures through 2007 to comply in 2002 the environmental management systems at atlantic copper’s operations in huelva cordoba and barcelona were audited by the spanish association for standardization and certification aenor in accordance with the iso 1400196 international certification standard and the new european union environmental ecomanagement and ecoauditing emas regulation no 7612001 aenor is a spanish notforprofit entity that has been accredited by the spanish government to inspect audit and certify environmental management systems atlantic copper received positive results from the audits which are required annually to retain the iso 14001 certification that atlantic copper achieved in prior years 

the indonesian and spanish governments may periodically revise their environmental laws and regulations or adopt new ones and we cannot predict the effects on our operations of new or revised regulations we have expended significant resources both financial and managerial to comply with environmental regulations and permitting and approval requirements and we anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future there can be no assurance that we will not incur additional significant costs and liabilities to comply with such current and future regulations or that such regulations will not materially affect our operations see risk factors

wanagon overburden stockpile slippage 

in may 2000 a slippage occurred in the overburden stockpile at the wanagon basin following a period of excessive rainfall causing a wave of water and material to overflow from the basin four employees of a contractor to pt freeport indonesia were working in the area and perished contained within the mud were the treatment solids from the lime precipitation of acid rock drainage which then entered the tailings river system near the village of banti we incurred environmental costs for overburden disposition overburden stockpile stabilization laboratory testing and consulting studies relating to the wanagon overburden waste stockpile pt freeport indonesia charged 29 million to its 2000 production costs primarily for assets lost as a result of the incident

sampling and monitoring were renewed and expanded at a number of stations covering the entire tailings system between the mine and estuary a specific environmental risk analysis was conducted as a result of this event and used data from the monitoring program no longterm environmental effects were found from the direct monitoring nor predicted by the environmental risk assessment the slippage caused a flow of sediments containing elevated levels of precipitated copper as a result water quality in the river was temporarily diminished due to higher levels of total suspended solids according to water quality tests the preslippage water quality in the river was substantially reestablished by the following day and was fully reestablished within 22 days after the incident

pt freeport indonesia engaged international experts and outside consultants led by a team from the institute of technology of bandung indonesia to conduct a comprehensive study of the cause of the slippage and to recommend a future course of action working with the close cooperation of the indonesian department of energy and natural resources and also bapedal the indonesian environmental protection agency we initiated an overburden stockpile stabilization program and voluntarily agreed to a temporary limitation on average production from the grasberg open pit of 200000 metric tons per day underground ore production was not affected a safezone based on engineering calculations was subsequently identified along the wanagon river and within the village of banti the residents within this zone were temporarily moved to tembagapura our original mining town site and the houses were removed these families were relocated to new housing designed according to their wishes and located on higher ground in banti

after successful completion of the stabilization program and consultation with affected local residents and with the approval of the indonesian government normal overburden placement at the wanagon overburden stockpile resumed and the restriction on production from the grasberg open pit was lifted at the end of 2000

employees and relationship with fm services company 

as of december 31 2003 pt freeport indonesia had 7802 employees approximately 98 percent indonesian and 6054 contract workers the vast majority of whom were indonesian approximately 40 percent of our indonesian employees are members of the all indonesia workers union which operates under government of indonesia supervision pt freeport indonesia has a labor agreement covering all of its hourlypaid indonesian employees the key provisions of which are renegotiated biannually in june 2003 pt freeport indonesia and its workers agreed to terms for a new labor agreement that expires september 30 2005 pt freeport indonesias relations with the workers union have generally been positive in addition 4436 persons worked for privatized companies providing services within pt freeport indonesia’s operations area

as of december 31 2003 atlantic copper had 784 employees of which approximately 75 percent are covered by union contracts in july 2003 atlantic copper successfully negotiated new labor contracts covering its smelterrefinery and copper wire manufacturing workforce in huelva spain with no material changes in terms atlantic coppers union contract in cordoba spain expired december 31 2003 and it expects to begin negotiations for a new contract in march 2004 atlantic copper’s union contracts in huelva and barcelona will expire on december 31 2004 and december 31 2006 respectively atlantic copper experienced no work stoppages in 2003 and relations with these unions have also generally been good

fm services company fm services has furnished executive administrative financial accounting legal tax and similar services to us fm services became our wholly owned subsidiary in october 2002 when we purchased the remaining 50 percent ownership in fm services from mcmoran exploration co mcmoran for 13 million as of december 31 2003 fcx had 14 employees and fm services had 149 employees fm services employees continue to provide services to mcmoran a publicly traded company engaged in the exploration development and production of oil and gas and stratus properties inc a publicly traded company engaged in the development of real estate 

nusamba loan guarantee 

in 1997 pt nusamba mineral industri nusamba an indonesian company and a subsidiary of pt nusantara ampera bakti acquired from a third party approximately 51 percent of the capital stock of pt indocopper investama pt indocopper investama is an indonesian company whose only significant assets are its approximate 936 percent ownership of pt freeport indonesias common stock and its 100 percent ownership of eastern minerals stock nusamba paid 616 million in cash and financed 2534 million of the 3150 million purchase price with a variablerate commercial loan from a syndicate of commercial banks including jpmorgan chase bank as agent which was to mature in march 2002 we guaranteed the nusamba loan for the purpose of continuing minority indonesian ownership of pt freeport indonesia we also agreed to lend to nusamba any amounts to cover any shortfalls between the interest payments due on the commercial loan and dividends received by nusamba from pt indocopper investama through december 31 2001 we loaned nusamba 689 million to cover such shortfalls and we charged 73 million of this amount to expense because the loans exceeded nusambas initial cash investment

in early 2002 nusamba informed us that it did not expect to be able to repay the bank loan or our loan at maturity on february 27 2002 we repaid the bank loan as provided for under the terms of our credit facilities and acquired nusambas ownership in pt indocopper investama for accounting purposes the transactions were deemed effective as of december 31 2001 as a result of our payment of the nusamba bank loan our ownership interest in pt freeport indonesia increased to 9064 percent from 8587 percent and our ownership interest in eastern minerals increased to 100 percent from 95 percent

because our primary operating assets are located in the republic of indonesia our business may be adversely affected by indonesian political economic and social uncertainties in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in a foreign country 

indonesia continues to face political economic and social uncertainties including separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces in particular several separatist groups are opposing indonesian rule over the province of papua where our mining operations are located and have sought political independence for the province in response to demands for political independence new indonesian regional autonomy laws became effective january 1 2001 however the manner in which the new laws will be implemented and the degree of political and economic autonomy that they may bring to individual provinces including papua is uncertain and is a current issue in indonesian politics moreover in papua there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the indonesian military social economic and political instability in papua could materially and adversely affect us if this instability results in damage to our property or interruption of our activities

maintaining a good working relationship with the indonesian government is important to us because all of our mining operations are located in indonesia and are conducted pursuant to contracts of work with the indonesian government accordingly we are also subject to the usual risks associated with conducting business in and with a foreign country including the risk of forced modification of existing contracts changes in the country’s laws and policies including those relating to taxation royalties imports exports and currency and the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel or having to enforce the judgment of a foreign court or arbitration panel against a sovereign nation within its own territory in addition we are subject to the risk of expropriation and our insurance does not cover losses caused by expropriation

our current credit ratings have an impact on the availability and cost of capital to us because our primary business operations are in indonesia reductions in the sovereign credit rating of indonesia have historically had an adverse effect on our credit ratings and we believe that this correlation is likely to continue

social economic and political instability in papua could materially and adversely affect us if this instability results in damage to our property or interruption of our activities 

on august 31 2002 three people were killed and 11 others were wounded in an ambush by a group of unidentified assailants the assailants shot at several vehicles transporting international contract teachers from our school in tembagapura their family members and other contractors to pt freeport indonesia on the road near tembagapura the mining town where the majority of pt freeport indonesia’s personnel reside the identity of the assailants remains unknown some press reports have indicated that members of the military may be responsible for the attack but military officials have denied these allegations other press reports have indicated that papuan separatists may be responsible for the attack but representatives of the separatists have denied these allegations we the us government the central indonesian government the papuan provincial and local governments and leaders of the local people residing in the area of our operations condemned the attack indonesian authorities and the us federal bureau of investigation continue to investigate the incident and we are supporting and cooperating fully with the investigations 

on october 12 2002 a bombing killed over 200 people in the indonesian province of bali which is 1500 miles west of our mining and milling operations indonesian authorities arrested 35 people in connection with this bombing and 29 of those arrested have been tried and convicted on august 5 2003 12 people were killed and over 100 others were injured by a car bomb detonated outside of the jw marriott hotel in jakarta indonesia a terror suspect will stand trial in jakarta and face dual charges of involvement in this incident and the october 12 2002 bombing press reports state that indonesian police blame both attacks on international terrorist organizations our mining and milling operations were not interrupted by the august 31 2002 october 12 2002 or august 5 2003 incidents

we cannot predict whether there will be additional incidents similar to the recent shooting or bombings if there were to be additional separatist terrorist or other violence in indonesia it could materially and adversely affect our business and profitability in ways that we cannot predict at this time

in addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry we face additional risks because our operations are located on difficult terrain in a very remote area 

our mining operations are located in steeply mountainous terrain in a very remote area in indonesia because of these conditions we have had to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities in addition the area receives considerable rainfall which has led to periodic floods and mudslides the mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time in addition to these special risks we are also subject to the usual risks associated with the mining industry such as the risk of encountering unexpected geological conditions that may result in caveins and flooding of mine areas our insurance may not sufficiently cover an unexpected natural or operating disaster

on october 9 2003 a slippage of material occurred in a section of the grasberg open pit resulting in eight fatalities on december 12 2003 a debris flow involving a relatively small amount of loose material occurred in the same section of the open pit resulting in only minor property damage all material involved in the affected mining areas has been removed the events caused us to alter our short term mine sequencing plans which is adversely affecting our nearterm production while we expect to resume normal production activities in the second quarter of 2004 no assurance can be given that these events will not adversely affect production over the longer term or that similar events will not occur in the future as a result of the fourth quarter slippage and debris flow events pt freeport indonesia notified its copper concentrate customers that it was declaring force majeure under the terms of its contracts as it would be unable to satisfy its annual sales and delivery commitments no assurance can be given that any concentrate customers will not challenge the declaration of force majeure or assert claims for the failure to sell and deliver copper concentrates

the terrorist attacks in the united states on september 11 2001 the potential for additional future terrorist acts and other recent events have created economic and political uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business and the prices of our securities 

terrorist attacks and other recent events have caused uncertainty in the world’s financial and insurance markets and may significantly increase global political economic and social instability including in indonesia in addition to the bali and the jw marriott hotel bombings there have been antiamerican demonstrations in certain sections of indonesia reportedly led by radical islamic activists radical activists have also threatened to attack foreign interests and have called for the expulsion of united states and british citizens and companies from indonesia

it is possible that further acts of terrorism may be directed against the united states domestically or abroad and such acts could be directed against properties and personnel of companies such as ours the attacks and the resulting economic and political uncertainties including the potential for further terrorist acts have caused our insurance premiums to increase significantly moreover while our property and business interruption insurance covers damages to insured property directly caused by terrorism this insurance does not cover damages and losses caused by war terrorism and war developments may materially and adversely affect our business and profitability and the prices of our securities in ways that we cannot predict at this time

our profitability can vary significantly with fluctuations in the market prices of copper and gold 

our revenues are derived primarily from the sale of copper concentrates which also contain significant quantities of gold and silver and from the sale of copper cathodes anodes wire rod and wire although we sell most of our copper concentrates under longterm contracts the selling price is based on world metal prices at or near the time of shipment and delivery

copper and gold prices fluctuated widely in 2002 and 2003 during 2002 the daily closing prices on the london spot market ranged from 64 cents to 77 cents per pound for copper and 278 to 349 per ounce for gold during 2003 the daily closing prices on the london spot market ranged from 70 cents to 105 per pound for copper and 320 to 417 per ounce for gold

world copper prices have historically fluctuated widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control including

 

 the strength of the united states economy and the economies of other industrialized and developing nations 

 available supplies of copper from mine production and inventories 

 sales by holders and producers of copper 

 demand for industrial products containing copper and 

 speculation 

world gold prices also have historically fluctuated widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control including

 

 the strength of the united states economy and the economies of other industrialized and developing nations 

 global or regional political or economic crises 

 the relative strength of the united states dollar and other currencies 

 expectations with respect to the rate of inflation 

 interest rates 

 sales of gold by central banks and other holders 

 demand for jewelry containing gold and 

 speculation 

any material decrease in market prices of copper or gold would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition see the section of this prospectus entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  disclosures about market risks  commodity price risk” for an analysis of the effect on our revenues and net income of changes in copper and gold prices 

our contracts of work are subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations and if a dispute arises we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel 

pt freeport indonesia’s contracts of work and other contracts of work in which we have an interest were entered into under indonesia’s 1967 foreign capital investment law which provides guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization our contracts of work can be terminated by the government of indonesia if we do not satisfy our contractual obligations which include the payment of royalties and taxes to the government and the satisfaction of certain mining environmental safety and health requirements indonesian government officials have periodically raised questions regarding our compliance with indonesian environmental laws and regulations and the terms of the contracts of work in order to address these questions the indonesian government formed a factfinding team in 2000 that reviewed our compliance with all aspects of pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work when or whether the indonesian government will release any report on its investigation is uncertain in addition we cannot assure you that the indonesian government’s report if and when it is released will conclude that we are complying with all of the provisions of pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work

moreover in recent years certain government officials and others in indonesia have questioned the validity of contracts entered into by the government of indonesia prior to october 1999  ie  during the suharto regime including pt freeport indonesia’s contract of work which was signed in december 1991 we cannot assure you that the validity of or our compliance with the contracts of work will not be challenged for political or other reasons pt freeport indonesia’s contracts of work and our other contracts of work require that disputes with the indonesian government be submitted to international arbitration notwithstanding that provision if a dispute arises under the contracts of work we face the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel and if we prevail in such a dispute we will face the additional risk of having to enforce the judgment of a foreign court or arbitration panel against indonesia within its own territory

any suspension of required activities under our contracts of work requires the consent of the indonesian government 

our contracts of work permit us to suspend certain contractually required activities including exploration for a period of one year by making a written request to the indonesian government these requests are subject to the approval of the indonesian government and are renewable annually if we do not request a suspension or are denied a suspension then we are required to continue our activities under the contract of work or potentially be declared in default moreover if a suspension continues for more than one year for reasons other than force majeure and the indonesian government has not approved such continuation then the government would be entitled to declare a default under the contract of work

with the approval of the indonesian government in 2001 we suspended our field exploration activities outside of block a due to safety and security issues and uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest areas covered by the contracts of work and an indonesian law enacted in 1999 prohibiting openpit mining in forest preservation areas we cannot predict when we will be able to resume our exploration activities in these areas we expect to continue to seek renewals of these suspensions for each of the suspended areas if required

our mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges and future changes in environmental laws or unanticipated environmental impacts from our operations could require us to incur increased costs 

mining operations on the scale of our operations in papua involve significant environmental risks and challenges our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of crushed and ground rock material called tailings that results from the process by which we physically separate the copper gold and silver bearing materials from the ore that we mine our tailings management plan uses the river system near our mine to transport the tailings to the lowlands where the tailings and natural sediments are deposited in a controlled area contained within a levee system that will be reclaimed and revegetated we incurred aggregate costs relating to tailings management of 83 million in 2003 70 million in 2002 and 97 million in 2001

another major environmental challenge is managing overburden which is the rock that must be moved aside in the mining process in order to reach the ore in the presence of air water and naturally occurring bacteria some overburden can cause acid rock drainage or acidic water containing dissolved metals which if not properly managed can have a negative impact on the environment

certain indonesian governmental officials have from time to time raised issues with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans including a suggestion that we implement a pipeline system rather than our river deposition system for tailings disposal because our mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area a pipeline system would be costly difficult to construct and maintain and more prone to catastrophic failure for these reasons we do not believe that a pipeline system is practical

we anticipate that we will continue to spend significant financial and managerial resources on environmental compliance in addition changes in indonesian environmental laws or unanticipated environmental impacts from our operations could require us to incur significant unanticipated costs

the volume and grade of the reserves we recover and our rates of production may be more or less than we anticipate 

our reserve amounts are determined in accordance with established mining industry practices and standards but are merely estimates of the mineral deposits that can be recovered economically and legally in addition our ore bodies may not conform to standard geological expectations because ore bodies do not contain uniform grades of minerals our metal recovery rates will vary from time to time which will result in variations in the volumes of minerals that we can sell from period to period some of our reserves may become unprofitable to develop if there are unfavorable longterm market price fluctuations in copper and gold or if there are significant increases in our operating or capital costs in addition our exploration programs may not result in the discovery of additional mineral deposits that we can mine profitably

we do not expect to mine all of our reserves before the initial term of our contract of work expires 

all of our current proven and probable reserves including the grasberg deposit are located in block a the initial term of our contract of work covering these reserves expires at the end of 2021 we can extend this term for two successive 10year periods subject to the approval of the indonesian government which under our contract of work cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably our reserves reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041  ie  through the expiration of the two 10year extensions and our current mine plan has been developed and our operations are based on the assumption that we will receive the two 10year extensions as a result we will not mine all of our reserves during the current term of our contract of work and there can be no assurance that the indonesian government will approve the extensions prior to the end of 2021 we expect to mine approximately 48 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable ore at december 31 2003 representing approximately 62 percent of pt freeport indonesia’s share of recoverable copper reserves and approximately 72 percent of its share of recoverable gold reserves

servicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors some of which are beyond our control 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our maturing debt depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow this ability to a significant extent is subject to commodity prices and general economic financial regulatory political and other factors that are beyond our control in addition our ability to borrow funds in the future to service our debt will depend on meeting the financial covenants in our bank credit facilities our 

10 ⅛ senior notes due 2010 our 6 ⅞ senior notes due 2014 and other debt agreements we may have in the future future borrowings may not be available to us under our bank credit facilities or from the capital markets in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund other liquidity needs as a result we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our debt on favorable terms could materially and adversely affect our financial condition

covenants in our bank credit facilities impose restrictions on us 

although we currently have no amounts outstanding under our bank credit facilities our bank credit facilities 

 

 restrict the repurchase of and payment of dividends on our common stock under certain circumstances 

 limit among other things our ability to 

   incur additional indebtedness 

   make investments 

   engage in transactions with affiliates 

   create liens on our assets and 

 require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests 

events beyond our control including changes in general economic and business conditions may affect our ability to satisfy these covenants which could result in a default if an event of default occurs the banks could declare any amounts outstanding together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable an event of default under our bank credit facilities may also give rise to an event of default under our other existing and future debt agreements 

covenants in our 10 ⅛ senior notes due 2010 and 6 ⅞ senior notes due 2014 also impose restrictions on us 

our 10 ⅛ senior notes and our 6 ⅞ senior notes limit among other things our ability to 

 

 

 pay dividends on our common stock and repurchase and redeem certain classes of our capital stock 

 incur additional indebtedness 

 make investments 

 engage in transactions with affiliates and 

 create liens on our assets 

 

movements in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates could negatively affect our operating results 

all of our revenues and significant costs are denominated in us dollars however some of our costs assets and liabilities are denominated in indonesian rupiah australian dollars or euros as a result we are generally less profitable when the us dollar weakens against these foreign currencies

the rupiahus dollar daily closing exchange rate ranged from 8124 to 9074 rupiah per us dollar during 2003 and on december 31 2003 the closing exchange rate was 8437 rupiah per us dollar compared with 8940 rupiah per us dollar on december 31 2002 the australian dollarus dollar and eurous dollar exchange rates fluctuated substantially in 2002 and 2003 during 2003 the australian dollarus dollar daily closing exchange rate ranged from 056 to 075 per australian dollar and the eurous dollar daily closing exchange rate ranged from 104 to 126 per euro on december 31 2003 and 2002 the closing exchange rates were 075 per australian dollar and 126 per euro and 056 per australian dollar and 105 per euro respectively

from time to time we have in the past and may in the future implement currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates however our hedging strategies may not be successful and any of our unhedged foreign exchange payment requirements will continue to be subject to market fluctuations in addition our bank credit facilities are based on fluctuating interest rates accordingly an increase in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition see the section of this prospectus entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  disclosures about market risks  foreign currency exchange risk” for an analysis of the effect on our operating costs of changes in exchange rates

because we are a holding company our ability to pay our debts depends upon the ability of our subsidiaries to pay us dividends and to advance us funds in addition our ability to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries assets is generally subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries creditors 

because we conduct business primarily through pt freeport indonesia our major subsidiary and other subsidiaries our ability to pay our debts depends upon the earnings and cash flow of pt freeport indonesia and our other subsidiaries and their ability to pay us dividends and to advance us funds contractual and legal restrictions applicable to our subsidiaries could also limit our ability to obtain cash from them our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries assets upon their liquidation reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries creditors including any trade creditors and preferred shareholders

general 

we are one of the worlds largest copper and gold mining and production companies in terms of reserves and production we are also the lowest cost copper producer in the world after taking into account credits for related gold and silver production our principal asset is the grasberg mine which we discovered in 1988 grasberg contains the largest single gold reserve and one of the largest copper reserves of any mine in the world

our principal operating subsidiary is pt freeport indonesia a limited liability company organized under the laws of the republic of indonesia and incorporated in delaware we own approximately 9064 percent of pt freeport indonesia and the government of indonesia owns the remaining approximate 936 percent pt freeport indonesia mines processes and explores for ore containing copper gold and silver it operates in the remote highlands of the sudirman mountain range in the province of papua formerly irian jaya indonesia which is on the western half of the island of new guinea pt freeport indonesia markets its concentrates containing copper gold and silver worldwide

pt freeport indonesia and eastern minerals conduct their current exploration operations and pt freeport indonesia conducts its mining operations in indonesia by virtue of their contracts of work both contracts of work govern our rights and obligations relating to taxes exchange controls royalties repatriation and other matters both contracts of work were concluded pursuant to the 1967 foreign capital investment law which expresses indonesias foreign investment policy and provides basic guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization a framework for economic incentives and basic rules regarding other rights and obligations of foreign investors specifically the contracts of work provide that the government of indonesia will not nationalize or expropriate pt freeport indonesias or eastern minerals mining operations any disputes regarding the provisions of the contracts of work are subject to international arbitration we have experienced no disputes requiring arbitration during the 35 years we have operated in indonesia

pt freeport indonesias contract of work covers both block a which was first included in a 1967 contract of work that was replaced by a new contract of work in 1991 and block b to which we gained rights in 1991 the initial term of our contract of work expires in december 2021 but we can extend it for two 10year periods subject to indonesian government approval which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably we originally had the rights to explore 65 million acres in block b but pursuant to the contract of work we have only retained the rights to 05 million acres which we believe following significant geological assessment contain the most promising exploration opportunities

eastern minerals signed its contract of work in august 1994 the contract of work originally covered approximately 25 million acres eastern minerals contract of work provides for a fourtoseven year exploratory term and a 30year term for mining operations subject to indonesian government approval which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably we can extend this period for two 10year periods eastern minerals contract of work requires us to relinquish our rights to 25 percent of the original 25millionacre contract of work area at the end of each of three specified periods as of december 31 2002 we had relinquished approximately 13 million acres and within three months of resuming exploratory activity under the contract of work we must relinquish approximately 06 million additional acres

beginning in 2001 because of safety and security issues and because of uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest areas covered by our contracts of work and an indonesian law enacted in 1999 prohibiting openpit mining in forest preservation areas we requested and received from the government of indonesia formal temporary suspensions of our obligations under the contracts of work in all areas outside of block a the current suspensions were granted for oneyear periods ending february 26 2003 for block b march 31 2003 for pt nabire bakti bakti mining and november 15 2003 for eastern minerals we are currently seeking renewals of the block b and pt nabire bakti mining suspensions and expect to continue to seek suspensions renewals for additional oneyear periods by written request to the government of indonesia for each of the suspended areas if required we cannot predict when we will resume our exploration activities in these areas

pt freeport indonesia pays a copper royalty under its contact of work that varies from 15 percent of copper net revenue at a copper price of 090 or less per pound to 35 percent at a copper price of 110 or more per pound the contract of work royalty rate for gold and silver sales is 10 percent

a large part of the mineral royalties under government of indonesia regulations are designated to the provinces from which the minerals are extracted in connection with our fourth concentrator mill expansion pt freeport indonesia agreed to pay the government of indonesia voluntary additional royalties royalties not required by our contract of work to provide further support to the local governments and the people of papua pt freeport indonesia pays the additional royalties on metal from production above 200000 metric tons of ore per day the additional royalty for copper equals the contract of work royalty rate and for gold and silver equals twice the contract of work royalty rates therefore our royalty rate on copper net revenues from production above 200000 metric tons of ore per day is double the contract of work royalty rate and our royalty rates on gold and silver sales from production above 200000 metric tons of ore per day are triple the contract of work royalty rates the combined royalties including the voluntary additional royalties which became effective january 1 1999 totaled 245 million in 2002 243 million in 2001 and 202 million in 2000

 

republic of indonesia 

general the republic of indonesia consists of more than 17000 islands stretching 3000 miles along the equator from malaysia to australia and is the fourth most populous nation in the world with over 200 million people following many years of dutch colonial rule indonesia gained independence in 1945 and now has a presidential republic system of government

our mining complex was indonesias first copper mining project and was the first major foreign investment in indonesia following the economic development program instituted by the indonesian government in 1967 we work closely with the central provincial and local governments in development efforts in the area surrounding our operations we have had positive relations with the indonesian government since we commenced business activities in indonesia in 1967 and we intend to continue to maintain positive working relationships with the central provincial and local branches of the indonesian government

political developments in may 1998 president suharto indonesias political leader for more than 30 years resigned in the wake of an economic crisis in indonesia and other parts of southeast asia and in the face of growing social unrest vice president bj habibie succeeded suharto in june 1999 indonesia held a new parliamentary election on a generally peaceful basis as the first step in the process of electing a new president in october 1999 in accordance with the indonesian constitution the countrys highest political institution the peoples consultative assembly composed of the newly elected national parliament along with additional provincial and other representatives elected abdurrahman wahid as president and megawati sukarnoputri as vice president

there were repeated challenges to the political leadership of president wahid after his election in october 1999 in july 2001 the peoples consultative assembly voted to remove president wahid and elected vice president megawati sukarnoputri as the new president the international community including the united states expressed support for the president and her cabinet

recent developments president megawati and her cabinet marked their first anniversary in office during 2002 and have committed to continued efforts to restore the countrys economy and investor confidence progress in achieving these goals has been hindered by the global economic slowdown and issues internal to indonesia president megawati has supported the international communitys efforts to counter terrorism while addressing political complexities in indonesia the worlds largest muslim country

on august 31 2002 three people were killed and 11 others were wounded in an ambush by a group of unidentified assailants who shot at several vehicles transporting international contract schoolteachers from our school in tembagapura their family members and other contractors to pt freeport indonesia on the road near tembagapura the mining town where the majority of pt freeport indonesias personnel reside the identity of the assailants remains uncertain we along with the us government the central indonesian government the papuan provincial and local governments have condemned the attack indonesian authorities and representatives of the us federal bureau of investigation continue to investigate the incident and we are fully supporting and cooperating with these ongoing investigations

on october 12 2002 a bombing killed approximately 200 people in the indonesian province of bali which is 1500 miles west of our mining and milling operations indonesian police working cooperatively with australian and us investigators conducted an investigation that has led to the arrest of 15 suspects press reports indicate that some of the suspects may be linked to international terrorist organizations our mining and milling operations were not interrupted by either the august 31 or october 12 incidents

the government of indonesia which provides security for pt freeport indonesias personnel and operations see “security matters” has expressed a strong commitment to protect natural resources businesses operating in indonesia including pt freeport indonesia with heightened security following the bali bombing and the shooting incident discussed above

economic and social conditions economic and political conditions in indonesia are challenging the indonesian economy grew by an estimated 3 to 4 percent in 2002 after growing by an estimated 3 percent in 2001 an estimated 5 percent in 2000 and remaining flat in 1999 indonesia is asias second largest exporter of oil and has benefited from higher oil prices in recent years however progress on reforming the nations failed banking system and raising capital from the sale of bankrelated assets has been slow as a result the country remains heavily reliant on foreign aid to balance its budget

after beginning the year at 10160 rupiahs to one us dollar the indonesian currency averaged approximately 9200 rupiahs to one us dollar during 2002 the stronger rupiah reflects weakness in the us dollar and the economic progress made by president megawatis administration

despite gradual improvements in the economy indonesias recovery remains vulnerable to ongoing political and social tensions proindependence movements in certain areas continue to be prominent especially in the province of aceh where the indonesian government signed a peace agreement with separatists in december 2002 and to a lesser extent in papua the area surrounding our mining development is sparsely populated by local people and former residents of more populous areas of indonesia some of whom have resettled in papua under the government of indonesias transmigration program a segment of the local population is opposing indonesian rule over papua and several separatist groups have sought political independence for the province in addition to the august 31 2002 shooting incident there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the indonesian military in papua

while the uncertainties of the regional autonomy process have created concern among foreign investors the indonesian government has repeatedly assured investors that existing contracts would be honored consistent with previous administrations president megawati and several of her cabinet members have publicly stated that the government of indonesia will honor previously existing contracts specifically including pt freeport indonesias contract of work the sanctity of our contracts of work is further supported by us laws which prohibit us aid to countries that nationalize property owned by or take steps to nullify a contract with a us citizen or company at least 50 percent owned by us citizens if the foreign country does not within a reasonable time take appropriate steps to provide full value compensation or other relief under international law

our investment in indonesia and papua we have a boardapproved policy statement on social employment and human rights and have comprehensive and extensive social cultural and community development programs to which we have committed significant financial and managerial resources these policies and programs are designed to address the impact of our operations on the local villages and people and to provide assistance for the development of the local people while we believe these efforts should serve to avoid damage to and disruptions of our mining operations our operations could be damaged or disrupted by social economic and political forces beyond our control

pt freeport indonesia contributes to the economies of papua and the republic of indonesia through the payment of taxes dividends and royalties voluntary economic development programs infrastructure development employment and the purchase of local and national goods in fact pt freeport indonesia has frequently been the largest taxpayer in the republic of indonesia in addition it pays royalties on all minerals removed from the ground

moreover since it began development activities more than thirty years ago pt freeport indonesia has made significant investments in infrastructure both for its use and for the use of the papuan public these infrastructure improvements include medical facilities roads an airport and heliports schools housing community buildings and places of worship

pt freeport indonesia is also one of the largest private employers in indonesia and by far the largest in papua as of december 31 2002 pt freeport indonesia directly employed 7679 people and companies that provide services to pt freeport indonesia employed 1565 contract workers in addition approximately 4400 persons worked for privatized companies providing services within pt freeport indonesias operations area

besides the estimated 2 billion paid in direct benefits to the indonesian government under the contract of work from 1992 through 2002 pt freeport indonesias operations have provided another 77 billion during this period in indirect benefits to papua and the republic of indonesia in the form of wages and benefits paid to workers purchases of goods and services charitable contributions and reinvestments in operations

nusamba loan guarantee 

in 1997 pt nusamba mineral industri nusamba an indonesian company and a subsidiary of pt nusantara ampera bakti acquired from a third party approximately 51 percent of the capital stock of pt indocopper investama pt indocopper investama is an indonesian company whose only significant assets are its approximate 936 percent ownership of pt freeport indonesias common stock and its 100 percent ownership of eastern minerals stock nusamba paid 616 million in cash and financed 2534 million of the 3150 million purchase price with a variablerate commercial loan from a syndicate of commercial banks including jpmorgan chase bank as agent which was to mature in march 2002 we guaranteed the nusamba loan for the purpose of continuing minority indonesian ownership of pt freeport indonesia we also agreed to lend to nusamba any amounts to cover any shortfalls between the interest payments due on the commercial loan and dividends received by nusamba from pt indocopper investama through december 31 2001 we loaned nusamba 689 million to cover such shortfalls and we charged 73 million of this amount to expense because the loans exceeded nusambas initial cash investment

in discussions subsequent to december 31 2001 nusamba informed us that it did not expect to be able to repay the bank loan or our loan at maturity on february 27 2002 we repaid the bank loan as provided for under the terms of our credit facilities and acquired nusambas ownership in pt indocopper investama for accounting purposes the transactions were deemed effective as of december 31 2001 as a result of our payment of the nusamba bank loan our ownership interest in pt freeport indonesia increased to 9064 percent from 8587 percent our ownership interest in eastern minerals increased to 100 percent from 95 percent and our balance sheet as of december 31 2001 includes the following

 an additional liability of 2534 million to reflect the borrowings to fund the repayment of the nusamba bank loan

 a reduction of other assets of 616 million to reflect the nonpayment of our loan to nusamba for interest shortfalls through june 30 2001

 an increase in deferred income taxes of 42 million to reflect tax liabilities relating to our increased equity ownership in pt freeport indonesia

 a reduction in minority interests of 520 million to reflect our increased equity ownership in pt freeport indonesia and

 an increase in property plant and equipment of 2673 million to reflect the cost of the acquisition in excess of the book value of the equity ownership in pt freeport indonesia we acquired

ore reserves 

during 2002 additions to the aggregate proven and probable recoverable reserves at the grasberg mining complex totaled approximately 866 million metric tons of ore these additions represent increases of 26 billion recoverable pounds of copper and 10 million recoverable ounces of gold yearend aggregate proven and probable recoverable reserves net of 2002 production were 26 billion metric tons of ore averaging 112 percent copper 102 grams per metric ton gt of gold and 373 gt of silver representing 533 billion pounds of copper 626 million ounces of gold and 1476 million ounces of silver the additions to kucing liar the deep ore zone and ertsberg stockwork zone ore bodies were essentially offset by 2002 production and other reductions at the grasberg open pit and at big gossan revisions to expected mill recoveries applied to the reserves also resulted in net increases in copper and gold recoverable reserves as a result of continuing low copper prices our exploration program for 2003 will focus on targets in block a that have high potential to add reserves and to provide information that will support future exploration

 

pursuant to joint venture arrangements between pt freeport indonesia and rio tinto rio tinto has a 40 percent interest in production from reserves above those reported at december 31 1994 net of rio tintos share pt freeport indonesias share of proven and probable recoverable copper gold and silver reserves was 394 billion pounds of copper 485 million ounces of gold and 1109 million ounces of silver as of december 31 2002 fcxs equity interest in proven and probable recoverable reserves as of december 31 2002 was 357 billion pounds of copper 440 million ounces of gold and 1005 million ounces of silver we estimated recoverable reserves using an average copper price of 085 per pound and an average gold price of 270 per ounce with respect to the proven and probable reserves presented below if metal prices were adjusted to the approximate average london spot prices for the past three years ie copper prices adjusted from 085 per pound to 075 per pound and gold prices adjusted from 270 per ounce to 285 per ounce there would be no change in our proven and probable reserves

all of our proven and probable recoverable reserves lie within block a the grasberg deposit contains the largest single gold reserve and is one of the largest copper reserves of any mine in the world aggregate grasberg open pit and underground proven and probable recoverable ore reserves as of december 31 2002 are shown below along with those of our other deposits reserve calculations were prepared by our employees under the supervision of george macdonald our vice president of exploration and were reviewed and verified by independent mining consultants inc experts in mining geology and reserve determination see risk factors we developed our current mine plan based on completing the mining of all of our currently designated recoverable reserves before 2041 which would be the expiration of our contract of work including two 10year extensions prior to the expiration of the initial term of our contract of work in december 2021 under our current mine plan we expect to mine approximately 58 percent of aggregate proven and probable ore representing approximately 65 percent of pt freeport indonesias share of recoverable copper reserves and approximately 74 percent of pt freeport indonesias share of recoverable gold reserves

ore reserve tonnage estimates are after application of applicable mining recovery factors

b

proven and probable recoverable reserves represent estimated metal quantities from which we expect to be paid after application of estimated mill recovery rates and smelter recovery rates of 965 percent for copper 970 percent for gold and 769 percent for silver the term “recoverable reserve” means that part of a mineral deposit which we estimate can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination

the following table sets forth the average drill hole spacing for each of our ore bodies drill hole spacing data is used by mining professionals such as mining engineers in determining the suitability of data coverage on a relative basis in a given deposit type and mining method scenario so as to achieve a given level of confidence in the resource estimate drill hole spacing is only one of several criteria necessary to establish confidence level for resource classification drilling programs are typically designed to achieve an optimum sample spacing to support the level of confidence in results that fit a particular stage of development of a mineral deposit we calculated the average drill hole spacing within each ore body using the distance from the center of each block in the resource model to the nearest drill hole composite we then calculated the averages of these values within the volume of each ore body and report them under the column entitled average distance to nearest sample this value represents at least onehalf of the average drill hole spacing within each deposit we calculated the value under the column entitled average distance between drill holes by multiplying the average minimum distance value by two and this value represents the maximum average drill hole spacing 

 mining operations 

we and our predecessors have conducted exploration and mining operations in block a since 1967 and have been the only operator of those operations following are descriptions of ore mines in production significant ore mines in development and our ore bodies

mines in production we currently have three mines in operation the grasberg open pit the intermediate ore zone and the deep ore zone as of december 31 2002 our capital expenditures incurred to date for our mining operations in indonesia totaled 47 billion our mine development expansion and infrastructure capital expenditures totaled 689 million in 2002 837 million in 2001 and 610 million in 2000 these expenditures primarily related to development of the deep ore zone ore body we began openpit mining of the grasberg ore body in january 1990 production is at the 3520to 4250meter elevation level and totaled 710 million metric tons of ore in 2002 and 782 million metric tons of ore in 2001 which provided 83 percent of our 2002 mill feed and 89 percent of our 2001 mill feed the underground grasberg reserves will be mined using the blockcave method near the end of openpit mining which is expected to continue until approximately 2015

the intermediate ore zone is an underground blockcave operation that began production in the first half of 1994 production is at the 3475meter elevation level and totaled 71 million metric tons of ore in 2002 and 76 million metric tons of ore in 2001 we expect to fully deplete the intermediate ore zone in the second half of 2003 

the deep ore zone ore body lies vertically below the intermediate ore zone we began production from the deep ore zone ore body in 1989 but we suspended production in 1991 in favor of production from the grasberg deposit production using the blockcave method at the deep ore zone restarted in september 2000 production is at the 3150meter elevation level and totaled 79 million metric tons of ore in 2002 and 20 million metric tons of ore in 2001 the deep ore zone exceeded the anticipated full production rate of 25000 metric tons of ore per day in the third quarter of 2002 well ahead of original projections production from the deep ore zone averaged 30200 metric tons per day in the fourth quarter of 2002 and 21800 metric tons of ore per day in 2002 we expect to expand the deep ore zone mines production rate to 35000 metric tons of ore per day in 2003 and we are studying opportunities to increase this rate

our principal source of power for all our operations is a coalfired power plant that we built in conjunction with our fourth concentrator expansion see infrastructure improvements mediumspeed diesel generators supply peaking and backup power a combination of naturally occurring mountain streams and water derived from our underground operations provides water for our operations the average annual rainfall in the project area is 180 inches

mines in development four other significant ore bodies referred to as the dom big gossan kucing liar and the ertsberg stockwork zone are located in block a these ore bodies are at various stages of development and are included in our proven and probable recoverable reserves we incurred 67 million for mine development expansion and infrastructure capital expenditures related to these ore bodies during the three years ended december 31 2002 see risk factors

the dom ore body lies approximately 1500 meters southeast of the depleted ertsberg openpit deposit we completed preproduction development at the dom including all maintenance warehouse and service facilities just as the grasberg mine began openpit production in 1990 we have deferred production at the dom ore body and may not begin until after completion of openpit mining at grasberg

the big gossan ore body is located approximately 1000 meters southwest of the original ertsberg openpit deposit we began the initial underground development of the ore body in 1993 when we drove tunnels from the mill area into the ore zone at the 3000meter elevation level a stope and fill mining method will be used on the big gossan deposit a feasibility study and an update to the sitewide development plan will be completed in 2003 to determine when to begin production

the kucing liar ore body lies on the southern flank of and underneath the southern portion of the grasberg open pit at the 2500 to 3100meter elevation level we are reviewing development plans for kucing liar

the ertsberg stockwork zone ore body extends off the southwest side of the deep ore zone ore body at the 3150 to 3750meter elevation level drilling efforts continue to determine the extent of this ore body which we expect to mine using a blockcave method after we complete mining at the deep ore zone ore body

the projected aggregate capital expenditures required to reach full production capacity for each of our undeveloped ore bodies based on our february 2003 mine plans and our proven and probable recoverable reserves as of december 31 2002 are shown below in millions actual costs could differ materially from these estimates as we will not incur most of the expenditures for several years and we will incur them over a period of several years in addition these costs will be shared with rio tinto in accordance with our joint venture agreement 

 

description of ore bodies our ore bodies cluster within and around two main igneous intrusions the grasberg monzo diorite and the ertsberg diorite the host rocks of these ore bodies include both carbonate and clastic rocks that form the ridge crests and upper flanks of the sudirman range and the igneous rocks of monzonitic to dioritic composition that intrude them the igneoushosted ore bodies the grasberg open pit and block cave and the ertsberg stockwork zone block cave occur as vein stockworks and disseminations of copper sulphides dominated by chalcopyrite and to a much lesser extent bornite the sedimentaryrock hosted ore bodies occur as magnetiterich calciummagnesian skarn replacements whose location and orientation are strongly influenced by major faults and by the chemistry of the carbonate rocks along the margins of the intrusions

the copper mineralization in these skarn deposits is also dominated by chalcopyrite but higher bornite concentrations are common moreover gold occurs in significant concentrations in all of the districts ore bodies though rarely visible to the naked eye these gold concentrations usually occur as inclusions within the copper sulphide minerals though in some deposits these concentrations can also be strongly associated with pyrite

the following diagram indicates the relative elevations in meters of our reported reserve ore bodies

 

 

 

the following map which encompasses an area of approximately 42 square kilometers approximately 16 square miles indicates the relative positions and sizes of our reported reserve ore bodies and their locations

 

the following chart illustrates our current plans for sequencing and producing each of our ore bodies and the years in which we currently expect that production of each ore body will begin and end our mine plan is subject to change based on a number of factors including the results of our exploration efforts

 

during 2002 we mined an average of 704900 metric tons of material per day including ore and overburden and do not require any additional approvals for higher rates during 2001 we mined an average of 684800 metric tons of material per day the following chart illustrates our current aggregate mill capacity our aggregate permitted mill capacity and our projected milling rates the decline in milling rates in 2015 reflects the expected completion date of openpit mining at the grasberg ore body we are continuing to develop mine plans to optimize production levels and to offset the anticipated decline in 2015

 

 

 

 

milling and production 

the ore from our mines moves by a conveyor system to a series of shafts through which it drops to our milling and concentrating complex located approximately 2900 meters above sea level at the mill the ore is crushed and ground and mixed in tanks with water and small amounts of flotation reagents where it is continuously agitated with air during this physical separation process copper gold and silverbearing particles rise to the top of the tanks and are collected and thickened into a concentrate the concentrate leaves the mill complex as a slurry consisting of approximately 65 percent solids by weight and is pumped through three parallel 115kilometer pipelines to our coastal port site facility at amamapare where it is filtered dried and stored for shipping ships are loaded at dock facilities at the port until they draw their maximum dockside water and they then move to deeper water where loading is completed from shuttling barges

our production results for the last three years are as follows

mill throughput averaged 235600 metric tons of ore per day during 2002 2200 metric tons per day lower than the record 237800 metric tons of ore per day during 2001 in may 2000 pt freeport indonesia in consultation with the government of indonesia voluntarily agreed to temporarily limit grasberg openpit production because of an incident at its wanagon overburden stockpile normal overburden placement at the wanagon overburden stockpile resumed and the restriction on production from the grasberg open pit was lifted at the end of 2000 see wanagon overburden stockpile slippage

copper production for 2002 was a record 15 billion pounds and was 1308 million pounds higher than that for 2001 primarily because of higher average copper ore grades gold production for 2002 was 338100 ounces lower than that for 2001 primarily because of significantly lower average gold grades

average net cash production costs per pound of copper of 008 were modestly higher for 2002 compared with 2001 primarily because of lower gold credits average net cash production costs were a recordlow 007 per pound for the year 2001 primarily because of higher credits from gold sales and because of lower site production costs our average net cash production costs per pound of copper vary with the amount of gold we sell and gold prices among other factors once we complete our openpit mining operations at the grasberg mine in approximately 2014 we expect annual gold production from our underground mines to be lower than current levels and all other factors being equal our average net cash production costs to increase for more information regarding our operating and financial results see “item 6 selected financial data” and “items 7 and 7a management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk”

joint venture with rio tinto 

in early 1998 pt freeport indonesia completed construction on the fourth concentrator mill expansion pursuant to the expansion joint venture agreement in addition to funding its 40 percent share of all expansion costs including the fourth concentrator mill expansion rio tinto provided a 450 million nonrecourse loan to pt freeport indonesia for pt freeport indonesias share of the cost of the expansion in less than two and onehalf years beginning in 1998 pt freeport indonesia repaid the 450 million loan plus interest from its share of incremental cash flow attributable to the expansion pt freeport indonesia and rio tinto proportionately share operating nonexpansion capital and administrative costs based on the ratio of a the incremental revenues from production from the expansion and b total revenues from production from block a including production from pt freeport indonesias previously existing reserves pt freeport indonesia receives 100 percent of the cash flow from specified annual amounts of copper gold and silver production through 2021 and will receive 60 percent of all remaining cash flow thereafter

exploration 

as a result of our joint venture arrangements rio tinto generally pays for 40 percent of our joint venture exploration and drilling costs in papua the joint ventures incurred total exploration costs of 48 million in 2002 and 144 million in 2001 the joint ventures exploration budget for 2003 totals approximately 8 million as a result of continuing low copper prices and the suspension of all activities outside of block a we reduced our exploration program for 2002 to focus largely on available exploration data limited drilling during 2002 was directed towards delineation of reserves adjacent to our deep ore zone ore body

in june 1998 we entered into a joint venture agreement to conduct exploration activities in pt nabire bakti minings contract of work area covering approximately 10 million acres in several blocks contiguous to pt freeport indonesias block b and one of eastern minerals blocks in papua rio tinto shares in 40 percent of our interest and costs in this exploration joint venture we and rio tinto can earn up to a 62 percent interest in the pt nabire bakti mining contract of work by spending up to 21 million on exploration and other activities in the joint venture areas we have spent 165 million through december 31 2002

with the approval of the indonesian government in 2001 we temporarily suspended our field exploration activities in block b which includes the wabu ridge gold prospect as well as in the other contract of work areas of eastern minerals and pt nabire bakti mining the suspensions are due to safety and security issues and uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest areas covered by the contracts of work and an indonesian law enacted in 1999 prohibiting openpit mining in forest preservation areas we cannot predict when we will be able to resume our exploration activities in these areas we expect to continue to seek renewals of these suspensions for each of the suspended areas if required all of the suspended areas are outside of our current mining operations area

infrastructure improvements 

the location of our mining operations in a remote area requires that our operations be virtually selfsufficient in addition to the mining facilities described above in the course of the development of our project we have constructed ourselves or participated with others in the construction of an airport a port a 119 kilometer road an aerial tramway two hospitals and related medical facilities and two town sites with housing schools and other facilities sufficient to support more than 17000 persons

in 1996 we completed a significant infrastructure program which includes various residential community and commercial facilities we designed the program to provide the infrastructure needed for our operations to enhance the living conditions of our employees and to develop and promote the growth of local and other third party activities and enterprises in papua we have developed the facilities through joint ventures or direct ownership involving local indonesian interests and other investors

from december 1993 to march 1997 pt freeport indonesia sold 2700 million of infrastructure assets to joint ventures owned onethird by pt freeport indonesia and twothirds by pt alatief nusakarya corporation alatief an indonesian investor funding for the purchases consisted of 900 million in equity contributions by the joint venture partners a 600 million bank loan and fcxs sale of 1200 million aggregate principal amount of its 9 ¾ senior notes the proceeds of which fcx loaned to the joint ventures

pt freeport indonesia subsequently sold its onethird interest in the joint ventures to alatief in march 1997 in september 1998 pt freeport indonesia reacquired for 30 million an aggregate onethird interest in the joint ventures with 175 million of such purchase price paid in 1998 and the remaining 125 million paid in 1999 during 2000 pt freeport indonesia purchased the remaining interest in the joint ventures for 259 million cash and the assumption of 341 million of bank debt

in december 1997 we sold the new coalfired power plant facilities associated with the fourth concentrator mill expansion for 3664 million to the joint venture that owns the power plants that already provided electricity to us the purchase price included 1232 million for rio tintos share of the new power plant facilities asset sales through 1997 to the power joint venture totaled 5814 million including 4582 million of assets we owned we subsequently sold our 30 percent interest in the joint venture to the other partners and we purchase power pursuant to a power sales agreement

pt freeport indonesia sells its copper concentrates which contain significant quantities of gold and silver under united states dollardenominated sales agreements mostly to companies in asia and europe and to international trading companies we sell substantially all of our budgeted production of copper concentrates under longterm contracts with selling prices based on world metals prices generally the london metal exchange settlement prices for grade a copper under these contracts initial billing occurs at the time of shipment and final settlement on the copper portion is generally based on average prices for a specified future period gold generally is sold at the average london bullion market association price for a specified month near the month of shipment

revenues from concentrate sales are recorded net of royalties see contracts of work treatment and all refining charges including participation charges if applicable based on the market prices of metals and the impact of derivative financial instruments if any used to hedge against risks from metals price fluctuations moreover because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrates is unrecoverable as a result of the smelting process our revenues from concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances based on the quantity and value of these unrecoverable metals these allowances are a negotiated term of our contracts and vary by customer treatment and refining charges represent payments to smelters and refiners and are either fixed or in certain cases vary with the price of copper we sell some copper concentrates in the spot market see risk factors

we have commitments including commitments from atlantic copper and pt smelting for essentially all of our estimated 2003 production we estimate our share of sales for 2003 to approximate 14 billion pounds of copper and 26 million ounces of gold projected 2003 copper and gold sales reflect the expectation of lower copper ore grades than in 2002 and higher gold ore grades see risk factors

pt freeport indonesia has a longterm contract through 2007 to provide atlantic copper with approximately 60 percent of its copper concentrate requirements at market prices pt freeport indonesias agreement with pt smelting provides for the life of pt freeport indonesias mines for the supply of 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements necessary to reach the gresik smelters design capacity the agreement also provides for the supply of substantially all of any incremental copper concentrate requirements that pt smelting may need in excess of the smelters design capacity through 2004 at market prices for the first 15 years of pt smeltings operations beginning in december 1998 the treatment and refining charges on the majority of the concentrate pt freeport indonesia supplies will not fall below a specified minimum rate currently 023 per pound which has been the rate since pt smelting began operating in 1998 the rate is scheduled to decline to a floor of 021 per pound in early 2004 we anticipate that pt freeport indonesia will sell approximately 50 percent of its annual concentrate production to atlantic copper and pt smelting a recap of pt freeport indonesias aggregate percentage concentrate sales to its affiliates and to other parties for the last three years follows

 

investment in smelters 

our investment in smelters atlantic copper and pt smelting serves an important role in our concentrate marketing strategy pt freeport indonesia sells approximately onehalf of its concentrate production to its affiliated smelters atlantic copper and pt smelting and the remainder to other customers

treatment charges for smelting and refining copper concentrates represent a cost to pt freeport indonesia and income to atlantic copper and pt smelting however because we have integrated our upstream mining and milling and downstream smelting and refining operations we are able to achieve operating hedges which substantially offset the effect of changes in treatment charges for smelting and refining pt freeport indonesias copper concentrates while low smelting and refining charges will adversely affect the operating results of atlantic copper low charges will benefit the operating results to pt freeport indonesias mining operations

as a result changes in smelting and refining charges do not have a significant impact on our consolidated operating results taking into account taxes and minority ownership interests an equivalent 001 per pound change in the charges pt freeport indonesia pays all of its customers including atlantic copper and pt smelting and the charges atlantic copper and pt smelting receive would essentially offset each other in our consolidated operating results

atlantic copper sa 

we own 100 percent of atlantic copper atlantic copper completed the last expansion of its production capacity in 1997 and its smelter currently has a design capacity of 290000 metric tons of copper per year we have no present plans to expand atlantic coppers production capacity during 2002 atlantic copper treated a record 1016700 metric tons of concentrate and scrap and produced 298000 metric tons of new copper anodes during 2001 atlantic copper treated 891100 metric tons of concentrate and scrap and produced 280000 metric tons of new copper anodes production for 2001 was negatively impacted by a scheduled 27day major maintenance turnaround in april 2001 the next 45day major maintenance turnaround is scheduled for 2004 atlantic copper purchased approximately 68 percent of its 2002 concentrate requirements from pt freeport indonesia at market prices atlantic copper has experienced no material operating problems and we are not aware of any potential material environmental liabilities at atlantic copper

we contributed 250 million to atlantic copper in 2002 76 million in 2001 and 324 million in 2000 the funds are intended to strengthen atlantic coppers financial structure during this period of extremely low treatment and refining charge rates our total investment in atlantic copper through december 31 2002 totaled 2449 million

pt smelting 

pt freeport indonesias contract of work required us to construct or cause to be constructed a smelter in indonesia if we and the indonesian government determined that such a project would be economically viable in 1995 following the completion of a feasibility study we entered into agreements relating to the formation of pt smelting and the construction of the copper smelter in gresik indonesia

pt smelting is a joint venture among pt freeport indonesia mitsubishi materials corporation mitsubishi corporation and nippon mining  metals co ltd which own 25 percent 605 percent 95 percent and 5 percent respectively of the outstanding pt smelting common stock in accordance with the joint venture agreements pt freeport indonesia provides nearly all of pt smeltings copper concentrate requirements in addition in connection with the formation of the joint venture pt freeport indonesia agreed to assign its earnings in pt smelting to support a 13 percent cumulative annual return to the other owners for the first 20 years of operations pt freeport indonesias total investment in pt smelting through december 31 2002 totaled 964 million

during 2002 pt smelting treated 719600 metric tons of concentrate and produced 211200 metric tons of new copper anodes during 2001 pt smelting treated 702900 metric tons of concentrate and produced 217500 metric tons of new copper anodes pt smelting has no present plans to expand its treatment capacity and has experienced no material operating problems we are not aware of any potential material environmental liabilities at pt smelting

competition 

we compete with other mining companies in the sale of our mineral concentrates and the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel some competing companies possess financial resources greater than ours and possess multiple mining assets less geographically concentrated in a single area than ours we believe however that we are the lowest cost copper producer in the world which gives us a significant competitive advantage

social development employment and human rights 

we have a social employment and human rights policy designed to result in our operating in compliance with the laws in the areas of our operations and in a manner that respects basic human rights and the culture of the people who are indigenous to the area we continue to incur significant costs on social and cultural activities primarily in papua these activities include



comprehensive job training programs 



basic education programs 



several public health programs including extensive malaria control



agricultural assistance programs 



a business incubator program to encourage the local people to establish their own small scale businesses



cultural preservation programs and 



charitable donations 

in 1996 pt freeport indonesia agreed to commit at least one percent of its revenues for the following 10 years to the freeport partnership fund for community development formerly the freeport fund for irian jaya development to support villagebased health education economic and social development programs in its area of operations this commitment replaced our community development programs in which we spent a similar amount of money each year our contributions totaled 152 million in 2002 141 million in 2001 and 141 million in 2000 to the freeport partnership fund for community development

lembaga pembangunan masyarakat amungme kamoro lpmak oversees disbursement of the funds we contribute to the fund lpmaks board of commissioners is made up of a leader of the amungme people a leader of the kamoro people leaders of the three local churches a representative of the local government and a representative of pt freeport indonesia

we believe that our social and economic development programs are responsive to the issues raised by the local villages and people and should help us to avoid disruptions of mining operations nevertheless social and political instability in the area may adversely impact our mining operations see risk factors

in december 2000 we endorsed the joint us state departmentbritish foreign office voluntary principles on human rights and security several major natural resources companies and important human rights organizations also endorsed the voluntary principles we participated in drafting these principles with all of the parties involved and incorporated them into our social and human rights policy

security matters 

consistent with our contract of work and the voluntary principles on human rights and security as well as our company’s duty to protect its employees and property pt freeport indonesia has taken appropriate steps to provide a safe and secure working environment as part of its security program pt freeport indonesia maintains its own internal security department which performs functions such as protecting company facilities monitoring the shipment of company goods through the airport and terminal assisting in traffic control and aiding rescue operations pt freeport indonesias civilian security employees numbering about 680 are unarmed and perform duties consistent with their internal security role pt freeport indonesias share of costs for its internal civilian security department totaled 77 million for 2002 and 68 million for 2001 the security department has received human rights training and each member is required to certify his or her compliance with our human rights policy

pt freeport indonesia like all businesses and residents of indonesia relies on the government of indonesia for the provision of public order upholding the rule of law and the protection of personnel and property the grasberg mine has been designated by the government of indonesia as one of indonesias vital national assets this designation results in the military’s playing a significant role in protecting the area of our operations since pt freeport indonesia began its operations in papua the indonesian military along with the police has had a presence in the contract of work area to provide law enforcement and to protect the mining operations area

the government of indonesia is responsible for employing military and police personnel and funding and directing their operations from the outset of pt freeport indonesia’s operations the indonesian government has looked to the company to provide logistical and infrastructure support and supplemental funding for these necessary services because of the limited resources of the government and the remote location and lack of development in papua pt freeport indonesias support for the indonesian government security institutions assigned to the operations area represents a prudent response to its requirements to protect its workforce and property and reflects the expectations imposed by the indonesian government on companies doing business in remote areas of indonesia such as papua in addition the provision of support is consistent with pt freeport indonesias obligations under the contract of work and reflects our philosophy of responsible corporate citizenship it is also in keeping with our commitment to pursue practices that will promote human rights which include our endorsement of the joint us state departmentbritish foreign office voluntary principles on human rights and security

pt freeport indonesias share of support costs for the governmentprovided security involving over 2000 government security personnel for the operations was 56 million for 2002 and 47 million for 2001 this supplemental support consists of various infrastructure and other costs such as food and dining hall costs housing fuel travel vehicle repairs allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs and community assistance programs conducted by the militarypolice pt freeport indonesias capital costs for associated infrastructure was 04 million for 2002 and 05 million for 2001 in addition over a period of several years prior to 2001 we constructed and provided infrastructure for housing offices and related facilities at a cost of approximately 35 million

environmental matters 

we have an environmental policy that commits us not only to compliance with applicable federal state and local environmental statutes and regulations but also to continuous improvement of our environmental performance at every operational site we believe that we conduct our indonesian operations pursuant to all necessary permits and are in compliance in all material respects with applicable indonesian environmental laws rules and regulations

mining operations on the scale of our operations in papua involve significant environmental challenges primarily related to the disposition of tailings which are the crushed and ground rock material resulting from the physical separation of commercially valuable minerals from the ore we have comprehensive ongoing environmental monitoring and management plans for the disposal of tailings resulting from our milling operations which the government of indonesia has approved pursuant to these plans we monitor and manage both the potential and confirmed impacts of our tailings disposal on the ecosystem of the ajkwa river and the ecosystems of adjoining water bodies and the surrounding coastal areas in 1997 we completed an engineered levee system to minimize the impact of the tailings through a controlled deposition area located on a portion of the flood plain on the ajkwa river we will revegetate and reclaim the deposition area when our mining operations are completed

in furtherance of our commitments to the indonesian government pursuant to our tailings plan we monitor the acidneutralizing capacity of tailings on a daily basis to ensure the discharge of nonacid generating tailings into our tailings deposition area the net acidneutralizing capacity of our tailings discharge is maintained through a managed program of blending underground ore with ore from the open pit the addition of supplemental limestone or lime to the ore blend when necessary and the addition of lime for control of the ph levels in the flotation system daily samples are collected and tested and this data is communicated to our mill operations so that adjustments in ore blending and limelimestone addition can be made as appropriate

with respect to overburden acid rock drainage generation is our primary environmental concern our approaches to this issue include the mitigation of acid rock drainage generation the control of acid rock drainage migration and the capture and treatment of acid rock drainage emanating from the overburden stockpile in addition tests have shown the feasibility of revegetating the overburden stockpile and as a result we have engaged in stockpile reclamation which is an additional means of mitigating acid rock drainage we have made significant capital expenditures with respect to the capture and treatment of acid rock drainage acid rock drainage is collected by boreholes near the base of the overburden stockpile and neutralized

we have committed to the indonesian government to have independent external environmental audits of our papuan operations performed by qualified experts every three years with the results to be made public we have had three independent environmental audits conducted by internationally recognized consulting and auditing firms sgs international certification services indonesia a member of the societe generale de surveillance group completed the 2002 environmental audit during the fourth quarter of 2002 and we expect to receive their final report in the first half of 2003 we also are continuing our annual internal audits through the life of our mining operations so that our environmental management and monitoring programs will remain sound and our operations will remain in material compliance with local laws

in connection with obtaining our environmental approvals from the indonesian government we committed to performing a onetime environmental risk assessment on the impacts of our tailings management plan we completed this extensive environmental risk assessment with more than 90 scientific studies conducted over four years and submitted it to the indonesian government in december 2002 the environmental risk assessment was performed with input from an independent review panel which included representatives from the indonesian government academia and nongovernmental organizations the risks identified during this process were in line with our impact projections of the tailings management program contained in our environmental impact assessments approved by the government of indonesia

we have environmental approvals from the government of indonesia to operate our mill up to a maximum of 300000 metric tons of ore per day in 2002 we averaged 235600 metric tons of ore per day and in 2001 we averaged 237800 metric tons of ore per day

the cost of complying with environmental laws is a fundamental cost of our business we incurred aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs totaling 626 million in 2002 782 million in 2001 and 1061 million in 2000 including tailings management levee maintenance and mine reclamation in 2003 we expect to incur approximately 9 million of environmental capital expenditures and 37 million of other environmental costs these environmental expenditures are part of our overall 2003 operating budget

we are currently revegetating portions of the tailings deposition area upon the completion of our mining operations we will fulfill the remaining commitments we made to the indonesian government in connection with our tailings management plan our options for revegetation of affected areas of the tailings deposition area include forage crops and grasses fruits grains and vegetables and other traditional food and medicinal crops decisions on these options are made after consultation with local and regional government and local residents in addition to the revegetation and reclamation of the tailings deposition area we will continue to operate our wastewater treatment plants as long as necessary we will also monitor and test the water discharged from our mine and the ph sulfate and electrical conductivity levels of ground water in the tailings deposition area in addition we plan to provide additional flood protection to surrounding areas by diverting the ajkwa and otomona rivers and further enhancing levee embankments the stability of our levees will be ensured through periodic visual inspection revegetation of the levee embankments and the transfer of our levee roads for public use moreover we will submit an annual written report to the indonesian government regarding our reclamation activities

our ultimate reclamation and closure activities will be determined after consultation with the indonesian government local residents and other affected parties our best estimate at this time is that pt freeport indonesias aggregate reclamation and closure obligations on an undiscounted basis totaled approximately 120 million as of january 1 2003 we estimate the fair value of our aggregate total asset retirement obligations to be approximately 30 million at january 1 2003 estimates of reclamation and closure costs involve complex issues requiring integrated assessments over a period of many years and we may revise them as we perform more complete studies some reclamation costs will be incurred during mining activities while most closure costs and the remaining reclamation costs will be incurred at the end of mining activities which are currently estimated to continue for more than 30 years

moreover we cannot predict with any certainty the ultimate future uses of the tailings deposition area once our mining operations are completed in addition to forage crop and grass planting and food and medicinal crop production possible future uses of the tailings deposition area include rainforest production production of timber fuel woods fruits and nuts and other economic forestry and the cultivation of fish shellfish and other aquaculture the ultimate future uses will be determined after consultation with local and regional government and local residents

in 1996 we began contributing to a cash fund 41 million balance at december 31 2002 designed to accumulate at least 100 million by the end of our indonesian mining activities we plan to use this fund including accrued interest to pay for mine closure and reclamation costs any incremental costs in excess of this 100 million fund are expected to be incurred throughout the life of the mine and would be funded by operational cash flow or other sources an increasing emphasis on environmental issues and future changes in regulations could require us to incur additional costs that would be charged against future operations estimates involving environmental matters are by their nature imprecise and changes in government regulations operations technology and inflation could require us to revise them over time

in 1998 a court in huelva spain found an employee of atlantic copper guilty of a criminal offense against the environment in connection with atlantic coppers transportation and use of weak acid and spent electrolyte at a facility owned and operated by minas de rio tinto sal the court fined the employee approximately 48000 the huelva court ruling did not prohibit atlantic coppers huelva complex from continuing to engage in these operations moreover atlantic coppers weak acid and spent electrolyte transport and use operations have been authorized by spanish environmental regulators atlantic copper has voluntarily constructed an onsite plant for the treatment of weak acid and recycling of spent electrolyte since june 2001 no weak acid or spent electrolyte has been sent to the minas de rio tinto facilities

we believe that atlantic coppers facilities and operations are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable spanish environmental laws rules and regulations however in july 2002 the integrated pollution prevention and control guidelines were adopted under spanish law with a phase in for compliance by 2007 atlantic copper is assessing the potential impact of these new guidelines on its operations and expects that additional capital expenditures will be required to comply in 2002 the environmental management systems at atlantic copper’s operations in huelva cordoba and barcelona were audited by the spanish association for standardization and certification aenor in accordance with the iso 1400196 international certification standard and the new europoean union environmental ecomanagement and ecoauditing emas regulation no 7612001 atlantic copper received positive results from the audits which are required annually to retain the iso 14001 certification that atlantic copper achieved in prior years aenor is a spanish notforprofit entity that has been accredited by the spanish government to inspect audit and certify environmental management systems

the indonesian and spanish governments may periodically revise their environmental laws and regulations or adopt new ones and we cannot predict the effects on our operations of new or revised regulations we have expended significant resources both financial and managerial to comply with environmental regulations and permitting and approval requirements and we anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future there can be no assurance that we will not incur additional significant costs and liabilities to comply with such current and future regulations or that such regulations will not materially affect our operations see risk factors

 

wanagon overburden stockpile slippage 

in may 2000 a slippage occurred in the overburden stockpile at the wanagon basin following a period of excessive rainfall causing a wave of water and material to overflow from the basin four employees of a contractor to pt freeport indonesia were working in the area and perished contained within the mud were the treatment solids from the lime precipitation of acid rock drainage which then entered the tailings river system near the village of banti we incurred environmental costs for overburden disposition overburden stockpile stabilization laboratory testing and consulting studies relating to the wanagon overburden waste stockpile pt freeport indonesia charged 29 million to its 2000 production costs primarily for assets lost as a result of the incident

sampling and monitoring were initiated at a number of stations covering the entire tailings system between the mine and estuary a specific environmental risk analysis was conducted as a result of this event and used data from the monitoring program no longterm environmental effects were found from the direct monitoring nor predicted by the environmental risk assessment the slippage caused a flow of sediments containing elevated levels of precipitated copper as a result water quality in the river was temporarily diminished due to higher levels of total suspended solids according to water quality tests the preslippage water quality in the river was substantially reestablished by the following day and was fully reestablished within 22 days after the incident

pt freeport indonesia engaged international experts and outside consultants led by a team from the institute of technology of bandung indonesia to conduct a comprehensive study of the cause of the slippage and to recommend a future course of action working with the close cooperation of the indonesian department of energy and natural resources and also bapedal the indonesian environmental protection agency we initiated an overburden stockpile stabilization program and voluntarily agreed to a temporary limitation on average production from the grasberg open pit of 200000 metric tons per day underground ore production was not affected a safezone based on engineering calculations was subsequently identified along the wanagon river and within the village of banti the residents within this zone were temporarily moved to tembagapura our original mining town site and the houses were removed these families were relocated to new housing designed according to their wishes and located on higher ground in banti

after successful completion of the stabilization program and consultation with affected local residents and with the approval of the indonesian government normal overburden placement at the wanagon overburden stockpile resumed and the restriction on production from the grasberg open pit was lifted at the end of 2000

employees and relationship with fm services company 

as of december 31 2002 pt freeport indonesia had 7679 employees approximately 98 percent indonesian in addition as of december 31 2002 pt freeport indonesia had 1565 contract workers the vast majority of whom were indonesian approximately 45 percent of our indonesian employees are members of the all indonesia workers union which operates under government of indonesia supervision pt freeport indonesia has a labor agreement covering all of its hourlypaid indonesian employees the key provisions of which are renegotiated biannually in june 2001 pt freeport indonesia and its workers agreed to terms for a new labor agreement that expires september 30 2003 pt freeport indonesias relations with the workers union have generally been positive

as of december 31 2002 atlantic copper had 726 employees of which approximately 74 percent are covered by union contracts atlantic coppers union contract in cordoba spain expires december 31 2003 its union contracts in huelva and barcelona each expired december 31 2002 atlantic copper began negotiations for new contracts in february 2003 and has not encountered in significant issues to date atlantic copper experienced no work stoppages in 2002 and relations with these unions have also generally been good

this report contains “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws forwardlooking statements are all statements other than statements of historical facts such as statements regarding anticipated production volumes sales volumes ore grades commodity prices development and capital expenditures mine production and development plans environmental reclamation and closure cost and plans reserve estimates political economic and social conditions in our areas of operations and exploration efforts and results except for our ongoing obligations under the federal securities laws we do not intend and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements readers are cautioned that forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially from those projected anticipated or assumed in the forwardlooking statements important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements include the following 

because our primary operating assets are located in the republic of indonesia our business may be adversely affected by indonesian political economic and social uncertainties beyond our control in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in a foreign country 

indonesia continues to face political economic and social uncertainties including separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces in particular several separatist groups are opposing indonesian rule over the province of papua where our mining operations are located and have sought political independence for the province in response to these demands for political independence new indonesian regionalautonomy laws became effective january 1 2001 however the manner in which these new autonomy laws will be implemented and the degree of political and economic autonomy that they may bring to individual provinces including papua is uncertain and is a current issue in indonesian politics moreover there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the indonesian military social economic and political instability in papua could materially and adversely affect us if this instability results in damage to our property or interruption of our activities

on august 31 2002 three people were killed and 11 others were wounded in an ambush by a group of unidentified assailants who shot at several vehicles transporting international contract schoolteachers from our school in tembagapura their family members and other contractors to pt freeport indonesia on the road near tembagapura the mining town where the majority of pt freeport indonesias personnel reside the identity of the assailants remains uncertain some press reports have indicated that members of the military may be responsible for the attack but military officials have denied these allegations some press reports have also indicated that papuan separatists may be responsible for the attack but representatives of the separatists have denied these allegations we the us government the central indonesian government the papuan provincial and local governments and leaders of the local people residing in the area of our operations have condemned the attack indonesian authorities continue to investigate the incident and we are cooperating fully with the investigation representatives of the us federal bureau of investigation also visited the site and are consulting with the indonesian authorities about the incident

on october 12 2002 a bombing killed approximately 200 people in the indonesian province of bali which is 1500 miles west of our mining and milling operations indonesian police working cooperatively with australian and us investigators conducted an investigation that has led to the arrest of 15 suspects press reports indicate that some of the suspects may be linked to international terrorist organizations our mining and milling operations were not interrupted by either the august 31 or october 12 incidents

the government of indonesia which provides security for pt freeport indonesias personnel and operations has expressed a strong commitment to protect natural resources businesses operating in indonesia including pt freeport indonesia with heightened security following the bali bombing and the shooting incident discussed above

we cannot predict whether or not there will be additional incidents similar to the recent shooting or bombing if there were to be additional separatist or other violence in indonesia it could materially and adversely affect our business and profitability in ways that we cannot predict at this time

with the approval of the indonesian government in 2001 we temporarily suspended our field exploration activities outside of block a due to safety and security issues and uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest areas covered by the contracts of work and an indonesian law enacted in 1999 prohibiting openpit mining in forest preservation areas we cannot predict when we will be able to resume our exploration activities in these areas we expect to continue to seek renewals of these suspensions for each of the suspended areas if required

in august 1998 we suspended operations for three days at our grasberg mine in response to a wildcat work stoppage not authorized by the workers union by a group of workers a majority of whom were employees of our contractors the workers cited employment issues as the reasons for their work stoppage in march 1996 local people engaged in acts of vandalism that caused approximately 3 million of damages to our property as a precautionary measure we closed the grasberg mine and mill for three days

maintaining a good working relationship with the indonesian government is important to us because all of our mining operations are located in indonesia and are conducted pursuant to contracts of work with the indonesian government for a discussion of the risks relating to our contracts of work see the risk factor below accordingly we are also subject to the usual risks associated with conducting business in a foreign country including the risk of forced modification of existing contracts changes in the countrys laws or policies including laws or policies relating to taxation royalties imports exports and currency and the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or having to enforce the judgment of a foreign court or arbitration panel against a sovereign nation within its own territory in addition we are subject to the risk of expropriation and our insurance does not cover losses caused by expropriation

our current credit ratings have an impact on the availability and cost of capital to us because our primary business operations are in indonesia reductions in the sovereign credit ratings of indonesia have historically had an adverse effect on our credit ratings and we believe that this relationship is likely to continue

the us military action in iraq the terrorist attacks in the united states on september 11 2001 the potential for additional future terrorist acts and other recent events have created economic and political uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business and the prices of our securities 

the recently launched us military action in iraq the terrorist attacks that took place in the united states on september 11 2001 the potential for additional future terrorist acts and the growing tensions between the us and north korea have caused uncertainty in the worlds financial and insurance markets and may significantly increase global political economic and social instability including in indonesia the country in which we primarily operate in addition to the october 12 2002 bombing in bali there have been antiamerican demonstrations in certain sections of indonesia reportedly led by radical islamic activists radical activists have also threatened to attack foreign assets and have called for the expulsion of united states and british citizens and companies from indonesia

it is possible that further acts of terrorism may be directed against the united states domestically or abroad and such acts of terrorism could be directed against properties and personnel of companies such as ours the attacks and the resulting economic and political uncertainties including the potential for further terrorist acts have caused the premiums charged for our insurance coverages to increase significantly moreover while our property and business interruption insurance covers damages to insured property directly caused by terrorism this insurance does not cover damages and losses caused by war terrorism and war developments may materially and adversely affect our business and profitability and the prices of our securities in ways that we cannot predict at this time 

our contracts of work are subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations and if a dispute arises we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or panel in addition unless the indonesian government permits us to suspend activities under our contracts of work we are required to continue those activities or potentially be declared in default 

pt freeport indonesias and eastern minerals contracts of work were entered into under indonesias 1967 foreign capital investment law which provides guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization our contracts of work can be terminated by the government of indonesia if we do not satisfy our contractual obligations which include the payment of royalties and taxes to the government and the satisfaction of certain mining environmental safety and health requirements indonesian government officials have periodically raised questions regarding our compliance with indonesian environmental laws and regulations and the terms of the contracts of work in order to address these questions the indonesian government formed a factfinding team in 2000 that reviewed our compliance with all aspects of pt freeport indonesias contract of work when or whether the indonesian government will release its report on its investigation is uncertain in addition we cannot assure you that the indonesian governments report if and when they release it will conclude that we are complying with all of the provisions of pt freeport indonesias contract of work

moreover in recent years certain government officials and others in indonesia have questioned the validity of contracts entered into by the government of indonesia prior to october 1999 including pt freeport indonesias contract of work which was signed in december 1991 we cannot assure you that the validity of or our compliance with the terms of the contracts of work will not be challenged for political or other reasons pt freeport indonesias and eastern minerals contracts of work require that disputes with the indonesian government be submitted to international arbitration notwithstanding the international arbitration provision if a dispute arises under the contracts of work we face the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or having to enforce the judgment of a foreign court or arbitration panel against indonesia within its own territory

in addition our contracts of work permit us to suspend certain activities including exploration under the contracts for a period of one year by making a written request to the indonesian government these suspension requests are subject to the approval of the indonesian government and are renewable annually if we do not request a suspension or are denied a suspension then we are required to continue our activities under the contract of work or potentially be declared in default moreover if a suspension continues for more than one year for reasons other than force majeure and the indonesian government has not approved such continuation then the indonesian government would be entitled to declare a default under the contract of work

servicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors some of which are beyond our control 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow this ability to a significant extent is subject to commodity prices and general economic financial regulatory political and other factors that are beyond our control in addition our ability to borrow funds in the future to service our debt will depend on our meeting the financial covenants in our bank credit facility our 10⅛ senior notes due 2010 and other debt agreements we may have in the future future borrowings may not be available to us under our bank credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund other liquidity needs as a result we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our debt on favorable terms could materially and adversely affect our financial condition 

covenants in the documents governing our indebtedness impose restrictions on us 

the documents governing our indebtedness 

 restrict the repurchase of and payment of dividends on our common stock

 limit among other things our ability to 

 make investments 

 engage in transactions with affiliates and 

 create liens on our assets and 

 require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests

events beyond our control including changes in general economic and business conditions may affect our ability to satisfy these covenants which could result in a default under the documents governing our indebtedness 

our mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges and future changes in environmental laws or unanticipated environmental impacts from our operations could require us to incur increased costs 

mining operations on the scale of our operations in papua involve significant environmental risks and challenges our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of crushed and ground rock material called tailings that results from the process by which we physically separate the copper gold and silver from the ore that we mine under our tailings management plan the river system near our mine transports the tailings to the lowlands where deposits of the tailings and natural sediments are controlled through a levee system for future revegetation and reclamation we incurred aggregate costs of 70 million in 2002 97 million in 2001 and 82 million in 2000 for our tailings management plan

another of our major environmental challenges is managing overburden which is the rock that must be moved aside in order to reach the ore in the mining process in the presence of air water and naturally occurring bacteria some overburden can cause acid rock drainage or acidic water containing dissolved metals which if not properly managed can have a negative impact on the environment

certain indonesian governmental officials have from time to time raised issues with respect to our tailings management plan and overburden management plan including a suggestion that a pipeline system rather than our current system be implemented for tailings disposal our ongoing assessment of tailings management has identified significant unresolved technical environmental and economic issues associated with a pipeline system because our mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area a pipeline system would be costly difficult to construct and maintain and more prone to catastrophic failure for these reasons we do not believe that a pipeline system is practical

we anticipate that we will continue to spend significant financial and managerial resources on environmental compliance in addition changes in indonesian environmental laws or unanticipated environmental impacts from our operations could require us to incur significant additional costs

the volume and grade of the reserves we recover and our rates of production may be more or less than we anticipate in addition we do not expect to mine all of our reserves before the initial term of our contract of work expires 

our reserve amounts are determined in accordance with established mining industry practices and standards but are only estimates of the mineral deposits that can be economically and legally recovered in addition our mines may not conform to standard geological expectations because ore bodies do not contain uniform grades of minerals our metal recovery rates will vary from time to time which will result in variations in the volumes of minerals that we can sell from period to period some of our reserves may become unprofitable to develop if there are unfavorable longterm market price fluctuations in copper and gold or if there are significant increases in our operating and capital costs in addition our exploration programs may not result in the discovery of additional mineral deposits that we can mine profitably

all of our current proven and probable recoverable reserves including the grasberg deposit are located in block a the initial term of our contract of work covering these reserves expires at the end of 2021 we can extend this term for two successive 10year periods subject to the approval of the indonesian government which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably our reserve amounts reflect our estimates of the reserves that can be recovered before 2041  ie  before the expiration of the two 10year extensions and our current mine plan has been developed and our operations are based on our receiving the two 10year extensions as a result we do not anticipate the mining of all of our reserves prior to the end of 2021 based on our current mine plan and there can be no assurance that the indonesian government will approve the extensions prior to the end of 2021 we expect to mine approximately 58 percent of aggregate proven and probable ore representing approximately 65 percent of pt freeport indonesias share of recoverable copper reserves and approximately 74 percent of pt freeport indonesias share of recoverable gold reserves

our profitability can vary significantly with fluctuations in the market prices of copper and gold 

our revenues are derived primarily from the sale of copper concentrates which also contain significant amounts of gold and substantially less significant amounts of silver and from the sale of copper cathodes anodes wire rod and wire although we sell most of our copper concentrates under longterm contracts the selling price is based on world metal prices at or near the time of shipment and delivery

copper and gold prices fluctuated widely in 2001 and 2002 primarily due to the slowdown in global economic activity and the economic and political uncertainties created by the terrorist attacks in the united states on september 11 2001 during 2002 the daily closing prices on the london spot market ranged from 64 cents to 77 cents per pound for copper and 278 to 349 per ounce for gold during 2001 the daily closing prices on the london spot market ranged from 60 cents to 83 cents per pound for copper and 256 to 293 per ounce for gold 

world metal prices for copper have historically fluctuated widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control including



the strength of the united states economy and the economies of other industrialized and developing nations



available supplies of copper from mine production and inventories



sales by holders and producers of copper 



demand for industrial products containing copper and 



speculation 

world gold prices have also historically fluctuated widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control including



the strength of the united states economy and the economies of other industrialized and developing nations



global or regional political or economic crises 



the relative strength of the united states dollar and other currencies



expectations with respect to the rate of inflation 



interest rates 



sales of gold by central banks and other holders 



demand for jewelry containing gold and 



speculation 

any material decrease in market prices of copper or gold would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

in addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry we face additional risks because our operations are located on difficult terrain in a very remote area 

our mining operations are located in steeply mountainous terrain in a very remote area in indonesia because of these conditions we have had to overcome special engineering difficulties and to develop extensive infrastructure facilities in addition the area receives considerable rainfall which has led to periodic floods and mud slides the mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time in addition to these special risks we are also subject to the usual risks associated with the mining industry such as the risk of encountering unexpected geological conditions that may result in caveins and flooding of mine areas our insurance may not sufficiently cover an unexpected natural or operating disaster

movements in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates could negatively affect our operating results and earnings 

all of our revenues are denominated in us dollars however some of our costs assets and liabilities are denominated in indonesian rupiah australian dollars or euros as a result we are generally less profitable when the us dollar weakens against these foreign currencies

the rupiahus dollar daily closing exchange rate ranged from 8425 to 10510 rupiahs per us dollar during 2002 and on december 31 2002 the closing exchange rate was 8940 rupiahs per us dollar compared with 10160 rupiahs per us dollar on december 31 2001 the australian dollarus dollar daily closing exchange rate ranged from 051 to 058 per australian dollar during 2002 and on december 31 2002 the closing exchange rate was 056 per australian dollar compared with 051 per australian dollar on december 31 2001 the eurous dollar daily closing exchange rate ranged from 084 to 096 per euro during 2002 and on december 31 2002 the closing exchange rate was 105 per euro compared with 088 per euro on december 31 2001

from time to time we have in the past and may in the future implement currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates however our hedging strategies may not be successful and any of our unhedged foreign exchange payment requirements will continue to be subject to market fluctuations in addition certain of our debt is based on fluctuating interest rates accordingly an increase in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and limit our ability to obtain additional financing 

we have substantial indebtedness and as a result significant debt service obligations as of december 31 2002 on a pro forma basis to give effect to the sale in february 2003 of 575 million of our 7 convertible senior notes due 2011 the sale in january 2003 of 500 million of our 10⅛ senior notes due 2010 and the application of the net proceeds of these offerings to repay all of our borrowings under our bank credit facilities our total indebtedness outstanding would have aggregated approximately 28 billion in addition to increasing our total indebtedness the sale of the notes will also increase the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt as a result our interest expense will increase for the year ended december 31 2002 our interest expense was 1712 million and our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 341 on a pro forma basis our interest expense for the year ended december 31 2002 would have been 2333 million and our ratio of earnings to fixed charges would have been 251 

our substantial debt could have important consequences to you for example it could

 make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations

 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness which would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital capital expenditures and other corporate requirements

 increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions

 limit our ability to respond to business opportunities 

 limit our ability to borrow additional funds which may be necessary and



subject us to financial and other restrictive covenants which if we fail to comply with these covenants and our failure is not waived or cured could result in an event of default under our debt

because we are a holding company our ability to pay our debts depends upon the ability of our subsidiaries to pay us dividends and to advance us funds in addition our ability to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries assets is generally subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries creditors 

because we conduct business primarily through pt freeport indonesia our major subsidiary and other subsidiaries our ability to pay our debts depends upon the earnings and cash flow of pt freeport indonesia and our other subsidiaries and their ability to pay us dividends and to advance us funds contractual and legal restrictions applicable to our subsidiaries could also limit our ability to obtain cash from them our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries assets upon their liquidation reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries creditors including any trade creditors and preferred shareholders

arthur andersen llp our former auditors audited certain financial information included in this form 10k in the event such financial information is later determined to contain false or misleading statements you may be unable to recover damages from arthur andersen llp 

arthur andersen llp completed its audit of our financial statements for the year ended december 31 2001 and issued its report with respect to such financial statements on february 8 2002 subsequently arthur andersen was convicted of obstruction of justice for activities relating to its previous work for enron corp

in july 2002 our board of directors at the recommendation of our audit committee approved the appointment of ernst  young llp as our independent public accountants to audit our financial statements for 2002 ernst  young replaced arthur andersen which had served as our independent auditors since 1988 we had no disagreements with arthur andersen on any matter of accounting principle or practice financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure arthur andersen audited the financial statements that we include in this form 10k as of december 31 2001 and 2000 and for each of the years in the twoyear period ended december 31 2001 as set forth in their reports herein 

in june of 2002 arthur andersen was convicted of obstructing justice which is a felony offense the sec prohibits firms convicted of a felony from auditing public companies arthur andersen is thus unable to consent to the incorporation of its audit opinion on our 2000 and 2001 financial statements into this form 10k under these circumstances rule 437a under the securities act permits us to file this form 10k which is incorporated by reference into registration statements on file with the sec without a written consent from arthur andersen

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings of a character normally incident to the ordinary course of our business we believe that potential liability in such proceedings would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations we maintain liability insurance to cover some but not all potential liabilities normally incident to the ordinary course of our business as well as other insurance coverage customary in our business with coverage limits that we deem prudent

 items 1 and 2 business and properties 

general

  we are one of the worlds largest copper and gold mining companies in terms of reserves and production we believe we are the lowest cost copper producer in the world after taking into account customary credits for related gold and silver production

  our principal operating subsidiary is pt freeport indonesia a limited liability company organized under the laws of the republic of indonesia and domesticated in delaware pt freeport indonesia explores for develops mines and processes ore containing copper gold and silver our operations are located in the remote rugged highlands of the sudirman mountain range in the province of papua formerly irian jaya indonesia which is located on the western half of the island of new guinea pt freeport indonesia markets its concentrates containing copper gold and silver worldwide as of december 31 2001 we had an 8586 percent ownership interest in this subsidiary and the government of indonesia had a 936 percent interest pt nusamba mineral industri nusamba an indonesian company had most of the remaining ownership interest in pt freeport indonesia see the discussion under nusamba loan guarantee about our guarantee and repayment of certain nusamba debt on february 27 2002 after repayment of the nusamba debt and the acquisition of nusambas interest in pt indocopper investama we have an approximate 906 percent ownership interest in pt freeport indonesia

  pt freeport indonesias operations are conducted pursuant to an agreement called a contract of work with the government of indonesia the contract of work allows us to conduct exploration mining and production activities in a 24700acre area that we call block a in 1988 we discovered our largest mine grasberg in block a grasberg contains the largest single gold reserve and one of the largest copper reserves of any mine in the world the contract of work also allows us to explore for minerals in a 05 millionacre area that we call block b all of our current proven and probable reserves are located in block a see ore reserves

  pt freeport indonesias contract of work governs our rights and obligations relating to taxes exchange controls royalties repatriation and other matters see contracts of work the contract of work provides a 35 percent corporate income tax rate for pt freeport indonesia and a withholding tax rate of 10 percent based on the tax treaty between indonesia and the united states on dividends and interest paid to us by pt freeport indonesia the contract of work also provides for royalties on the metals pt freeport indonesia sells

  another of our operating subsidiaries pt irja eastern minerals which we refer to as eastern minerals holds an additional contract of work in papua covering approximately 125 million acres and is conducting exploration activities under this contract of work as of december 31 2001 we had a 949 percent ownership interest in eastern minerals but after acquiring nusambas interest in pt indocopper investama discussed in nusamba loan guarantee we have a 100 percent ownership interest

  in 1996 we established joint ventures with rio tinto plc an international mining company with headquarters in london england one joint venture covers pt freeport indonesias mining operations in block a this joint venture gives rio tinto through 2021 a 40 percent interest in certain assets and in production above specified levels from operations in block a and after 2021 a 40 percent interest in all production in block a under our joint venture arrangements rio tinto also has a 40 percent interest in pt freeport indonesias contract of work and eastern minerals contract of work in addition rio tinto has the option to participate in 40 percent of any of our other future exploration projects in papua

  under another joint venture agreement through pt nabire bakti mining we conduct exploration activities in an area covering approximately 05 million acres in five parcels contiguous to pt freeport indonesias block b and one of eastern minerals blocks rio tinto has elected to participate in 40 percent of our interest and cost in the venture

  field exploration activities outside of our current mining operations in block a have been temporarily suspended due to safety and security issues and uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest areas covered by our contracts of work and an indonesian law enacted in 1999 prohibiting openpit mining in forest preservation areas

  we also smelt and refine copper concentrates in spain and market the refined copper products through our wholly owned subsidiary atlantic copper sa in addition pt freeport indonesia has a 25 percent interest in pt smelting an indonesian company that operates a copper smelter and refinery in gresik indonesia

  the following maps indicate the location of the papua province in which we operate the location of our contracts of work areas within the papua province and the infrastructure of our contracts of work project area 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nusamba loan guarantee

  in 1997 we guaranteed a 2534 million loan from a syndicate of commercial banks including jpmorgan chase bank as agent to pt nusamba mineral industri nusamba an indonesian company used the loan proceeds plus 616 million of cash for a total of 3150 million to purchase stock in pt indocopper investama a company whose only significant assets are its 936 percent of pt freeport indonesias stock and its 100 percent of eastern minerals stock nusamba owned approximately 51 percent of pt indocopper investamas stock and we owned approximately 49 percent we guaranteed the nusamba loan for the purpose of continuing minority indonesian ownership in our principal operating subsidiary pt freeport indonesia nusamba acquired the ownership interest from our previous indonesian partner to whom we sold the interest in 1991 to satisfy the indonesian ownership requirements in our contract of work those requirements were relaxed in 1997 but at the time of the nusamba transaction we believed that it was prudent and in our best interests to facilitate the continuation of indonesian ownership although no longer legally required

  the loan was secured by a pledge of the pt indocopper investama stock owned by nusamba and was to be due in march 2002 we had also agreed to lend nusamba any amounts necessary to cover shortfalls between the interest payments on the loan and dividends received by nusamba on the pt indocopper investama stock this loan was also to be due in march 2002 except for nusambas indirect ownership of pt freeport indonesia stock our guarantee of nusambas bank loan and our loans to nusamba we had no ownership interest in or contractual relationships with nusamba

  in discussions subsequent to december 31 2001 nusamba informed us that it did not expect to be able to repay the bank loan or our loan at maturity which obligated us to pay the bank loan on february 27 2002 we repaid nusambas bank loan as provided for under the terms of our amended credit facilities and acquired nusambas ownership in pt indocopper investama as a result of our payment of the nusamba bank loan on our yearend 2001 balance sheet we have

recorded an additional liability of 2534 million to reflect the payment of the nusamba bank loan reduced our other assets by 616 million to reflect the nonpayment of our loan to nusamba increased deferred income taxes by 42 million to reflect tax liabilities relating to our increased equity ownership in pt freeport indonesia reduced minority interests by 520 million to reflect our increased equity ownership in pt freeport indonesia and increased property plant and equipment by 2673 million to reflect the cost of the acquisition in excess of the book value of the equity ownership in pt freeport indonesia we acquired republic of indonesia

  the republic of indonesia consists of more than 17000 islands stretching 3000 miles along the equator from malaysia to australia and is the fourth most populous nation in the world with over 200 million people following many years of dutch colonial rule indonesia gained independence in 1945 and now has a presidential republic system of government

  maintaining a good working relationship with the government of indonesia is of particular importance to us because all of our mining operations are located in indonesia our mining complex was indonesias first copper mining project and was the first major foreign investment in indonesia following the economic development program instituted by the government of indonesia in 1967 we work closely with the central provincial and local governments in development efforts in the area surrounding our operations

  in may 1998 president suharto indonesias political leader for more than 30 years resigned in the wake of an economic crisis in indonesia and other parts of southeast asia and in the face of growing social unrest vice president bj habibie succeeded suharto in june 1999 indonesia held a new parliamentary election on a generally peaceful basis as the first step in the process of electing a new president in october 1999 in accordance with the indonesian constitution the countrys highest political institution the peoples consultative assembly composed of the newly elected national parliament along with additional provincial and other representatives elected abdurrahman wahid as president and megawati sukarnoputri as vice president

  there were repeated challenges to the political leadership of president wahid since his election in october 1999 in july 2001 the peoples consultative assembly voted to immediately remove president wahid and elected vice president megawati sukarnoputri as the new president the international community including the united states expressed support for the newly elected president and cabinet

  economic and political conditions remain challenging in indonesia the indonesian economy grew by an estimated 3 percent in 2001 after growing by an estimated 5 percent in 2000 and remaining flat in 1999 indonesia is asias second largest exporter of oil and has benefited from higher oil prices in recent years progress on reforming the nations failed banking system and raising capital from the sale of bankrelated assets has been slow as a result the country remains heavily reliant on foreign aid to balance its budget and the national currency the rupiah declined approximately 10 percent in value during 2001

  despite gradual improvements on the economic front indonesias recovery remains vulnerable to ongoing political and social tensions incidents of violence and separatist pressures continue to add to political instability within the country as the sukarnoputri administration works to address the countrys economic and social issues although incidents of violence continue to be reported in papua no incidents of separatist violence were reported in pt freeport indonesias area of operations where the local community leaders continue to support peaceful solutions to the complex issue of regional autonomy

  while the uncertainties of the autonomy process have created concern among foreign investors the indonesian government has repeatedly assured investors that existing contracts would be honored the president of indonesia and several cabinet members have publicly stated that the government of indonesia will honor previously existing contracts and that they have no intention of revoking or unilaterally amending such contracts specifically including pt freeport indonesias contract of work our belief that our contracts of work will continue to be honored is further supported by us laws which prohibit us aid to countries that nationalize property owned by or take steps to nullify a contract with a us citizen or company at least 50 percent owned by us citizens if the foreign country does not within a reasonable time take appropriate steps to provide full value compensation or other relief under international law

  proindependence movements in certain areas continue to be prominent especially in the province of aceh and to a lesser extent in papua the area surrounding our mining development is sparsely populated by local people and former residents of more populous areas of indonesia some of whom have resettled in papua under the government of indonesias transmigration program a segment of the local population is opposing indonesian rule over papua and several separatist groups have sought political independence for the province in papua there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the indonesian military

  we have a boardapproved policy statement on social employment and human rights and have comprehensive and extensive social cultural and community development programs to which we have committed significant financial and managerial resources these policies and programs are designed to address the impact of our operations on the local villages and people and to provide assistance for the development of the local people while we believe these efforts should serve to avoid damage to and disruptions of our mining operations our operations could be damaged or disrupted by social economic and political forces beyond our control for example in march 1996 local people engaged in acts of vandalism that caused approximately 3 million in damages to our property and caused us to close the grasberg mine and mill for three days as a precautionary measure although our concentrate shipments were not interrupted see risk factors

contracts of work

  pt freeport indonesia and eastern minerals conduct their current exploration operations and pt freeport indonesia conducts its mining operations in indonesia by virtue of their contracts of work both contracts of work govern our rights and obligations relating to taxes exchange controls royalties repatriation and other matters both contracts of work were concluded pursuant to the 1967 foreign capital investment law which expresses indonesias foreign investment policy and provides basic guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization a framework for economic incentives and basic rules regarding other rights and obligations of foreign investors any disputes regarding the provisions of the contracts of work are subject to international arbitration

  pt freeport indonesias contract of work covers both block a which was first included in a 1967 contract of work that was replaced by a new contract of work in 1991 and block b to which we gained rights in 1991 the initial term of our contract of work expires in december 2021 but we can extend it for two 10year periods subject to indonesian government approval which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably we originally had the rights to explore 65 million acres in block b but pursuant to the contract of work we have only retained the rights to 05 million acres which we believe following significant geological assessment contain the most promising exploration opportunities

  eastern minerals signed its contract of work in august 1994 the contract of work originally covered approximately 25 million acres eastern minerals contract of work provides for a fourtoseven year exploratory term and a 30year term for mining operations which we can extend for two 10year periods subject to indonesian government approval which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably in 2001 because of safety and security issues and uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest areas covered by our contracts of work and an indonesian law enacted in 1999 prohibiting openpit mining in forest preservation areas we requested and received from the government of indonesia formal temporary suspensions of our obligations under the contracts of work in all areas outside of block a these suspensions were granted for oneyear periods ending february 26 2002 for block b march 31 2002 for pt nabire mining and november 15 2002 for eastern minerals we are currently seeking a renewal of the block b suspension and expect to seek suspension renewals for the other areas in 2002 for one or more additional oneyear periods by written request to the government of indonesia

  like the pt freeport indonesia contract the eastern minerals contract of work requires us to relinquish our rights to 25 percent of the original 25 millionacre contract of work area at the end of each of three specified periods as of december 31 2001 we had relinquished approximately 125 million acres and within three months of resuming exploratory activity under the contract of work we must relinquish approximately 06 million additional acres

  pt freeport indonesia pays a copper royalty under its contact of work that varies from 15 percent of copper net revenue at a copper price of 090 or less per pound to 35 percent at a copper price of 110 or more per pound the contract of work royalty rate for gold and silver sales is 10 percent

  a large part of the mineral royalties under government of indonesia regulations are designated to the provinces from which the minerals are extracted in connection with our fourth concentrator mill expansion pt freeport indonesia agreed to pay the government of indonesia voluntary additional royalties that is royalties not required by our contract of work to provide further support to the local governments and the people of papua the additional royalties are paid on metal from production above 200000 metric tons of ore per day the additional royalty for copper equals the contract of work royalty rate and for gold and silver equals twice the contract of work royalty rates therefore our royalty rate on copper net revenues from production above 200000 metric tons of ore per day is double the contract of work royalty rate and our royalty rates on gold and silver sales from production above 200000 metric tons of ore per day are triple the contract of work royalty rates

  the combined royalties including the voluntary additional royalties which became effective january 1 1999 totaled 243 million in 2001 202 million in 2000 and 230 million in 1999

ore reserves

  during 2001 additions to the aggregate proven and probable reserves at the grasberg mining complex totaled approximately 156 million metric tons of ore representing increases of 32 billion recoverable pounds of copper and 43 million recoverable ounces of gold yearend aggregate proven and probable recoverable reserves net of 2001 production were 26 billion metric tons of ore averaging 113 percent copper 105 grams of gold per metric ton and 372 grams of silver per metric ton representing 525 billion pounds of copper 645 million ounces of gold and 1516 million ounces of silver additions were made to the dom open pit the grasberg block cave the deep ore zone block cave and at kucing liar improvements to gold recovery at the grasberg open pit offset reductions to gold recovery expectations at kucing liar

  pursuant to joint venture arrangements between pt freeport indonesia and rio tinto rio tinto has a 40 percent interest in production from reserves above those reported at december 31 1994 net of rio tintos share pt freeport indonesias share of proven and probable recoverable copper gold and silver reserves was 394 billion pounds of copper 502 million ounces of gold and 1145 million ounces of silver as of december 31 2001 fcxs equity interest in proven and probable recoverable reserves as of december 31 2001 including nusambas interest that we acquired subsequent to year end was 357 billion pounds of copper 455 million ounces of gold and 1038 million ounces of silver we estimated recoverable reserves using an average copper price of 087 per pound and an average gold price of 285 per ounce using a copper price of 075 per pound and a gold price of 270 per ounce would have resulted in less than a one percent reduction in our estimated recoverable copper and gold reserves

  all of our proven and probable reserves lie within block a the grasberg deposit contains the largest single gold reserve and is one of the largest copper reserves of any mine in the world aggregate grasberg open pit and underground proven and probable ore reserves as of december 31 2001 are shown below along with those of our other deposits reserve calculations were prepared by our employees under the supervision of george macdonald vice president of exploration for freeportmcmoran copper  gold inc fcx and were verified by independent mining consultants inc experts in mining geology and reserve determination see risk factors our current mine plan has been developed and our operations are based on completing the mining of all of our currently designated recoverable reserves before 2041 which would be the expiration of our contract of work including two 10year extensions prior to the expiration of the initial term of our contract of work in december 2021 under our current mine plan we expect to mine approximately 63 percent of aggregate proven and probable ore representing approximately 71 percent of pt freeport indonesias share of recoverable copper reserves and approximately 77 percent of pt freeport indonesias share of recoverable gold reserves

  

 

  

  

  the following table sets forth the average drill hole spacing for each of our ore bodies the average drill hole spacing within each ore body has been calculated using the distance from the center of each block in the resource model to the nearest drill hole composite the averages of these values were calculated within the volume of each ore body and are reported under the column entitled average distance to nearest sample this value represents at least onehalf of the average drill hole spacing within each deposit the value under the column entitled average distance between drill holes was calculated by multiplying the average minimum distance value by two and represents the maximum average drill hole spacing

  

mining operations

  we and our predecessors have conducted exploration and mining operations in block a since 1967 and have been the only operator of those operations following are descriptions of ore mines in production ore mines in development and our ore bodies

  mines in production  we currently have three mines in operation the grasberg open pit the intermediate ore zone and the deep ore zone as of december 31 2001 our capital expenditures incurred to date for our mining operations in indonesia totaled 46 billion our mine development expansion and infrastructure capital expenditures totaled 837 million in 2001 610 million in 2000 and 568 million in 1999 these expenditures primarily related to development of the deep ore zone ore body we began openpit mining of the grasberg ore body in january 1990 production is at the 3520 to 4250meter elevation level and totaled 782 million metric tons of ore in 2001 which provided 89 percent of our mill feed the underground grasberg reserves will be mined near the end of openpit mining which is expected to continue until approximately 2015

  the intermediate ore zone is an underground blockcave operation that began production in the first half of 1994 production is at the 3475meter elevation level and totaled 76 million metric tons of ore in 2001 we expect to fully deplete the intermediate ore zone by 2003

  the deep ore zone ore body lies vertically below the intermediate ore zone we began production from the deep ore zone ore body in 1989 but we suspended production in 1991 in favor of production from the grasberg deposit production using the blockcave method at the deep ore zone officially restarted in september 2000 production is at the 3150meter elevation level and totaled 20 million metric tons of ore in 2001 the deep ore zone is expected to ramp up from its approximately 14000 metric tons of ore per day rate at december 31 2001 to a full production rate of 25000 metric tons of ore per day by mid2002 well ahead of original projections we are conducting a feasibility study to assess increasing the deep ore zone mine production rate to 35000 metric tons of ore per day

  our principal source of power for all our operations is a coalfired power plant that was built in conjunction with our fourth concentrator expansion see infrastructure improvements peaking and backup power is supplied by mediumspeed diesel generators water for our operations is provided by a combination of naturally occurring mountain streams and water derived from our underground operations the average annual rainfall in the project area is 180 inches

  mines in development  four other significant ore bodies referred to as the dom big gossan kucing liar and the newly discovered ertsberg stockwork zone are located in block a these ore bodies are at various stages of development and are included in our proven and probable reserves we incurred 84 million for mine development expansion and infrastructure capital expenditures related to these ore bodies during the last three years see risk factors

  the dom ore body lies approximately 1500 meters southeast of the depleted ertsberg openpit deposit we completed preproduction development at the dom including all maintenance warehouse and service facilities just as grasberg began openpit production in 1990 we have deferred production at the dom ore body and may not begin until after completion of openpit mining

  the big gossan ore body is located approximately 1000 meters southwest of the original ertsberg openpit deposit we began the initial underground development of the ore body in 1993 when we drove tunnels from the mill area into the ore zone at the 3000meter elevation level we expect to use a variety of stoping methods to mine the deposit and plan to complete a detailed feasibility study in 2002 to determine when to begin production

  the kucing liar ore body lies on the southern flank of and underneath the southern portion of the grasberg open pit at the 2500 to 3100meter elevation level we are reviewing development plans for kucing liar

  the ertsberg stockwork zone ore body extends off the southwest side of the deep ore zone ore body at the 3150 to 3750meter elevation level drilling efforts continue to determine the extent of this ore body which we expect to mine using a blockcave method after we complete mining at the deep ore zone ore body

  the projected aggregate capital expenditures required to reach full production capacity for each of our undeveloped ore bodies based on our current mine plans and our proven and probable reserves as of december 31 2001 are shown below in millions actual costs could differ materially from these estimates as most of the expenditures will not be incurred for several years in addition these costs will be shared with rio tinto in accordance with our joint venture agreement

 

  description of ore bodies  our ore bodies cluster within and around two main igneous intrusions the grasberg monzo diorite and the ertsberg diorite the host rocks of these ore bodies include both carbonate and clastic rocks that form the ridge crests and upper flanks of the sudirman range and the igneous rocks of monzonitic to dioritic composition that intrude them the igneoushosted ore bodies the grasberg pit and block cave and the ertsberg stockwork zone block cave occur as vein stockworks and disseminations of copper sulphides dominated by chalcopyrite and to a much lesser extent bornite the sedimentaryrock hosted ore bodies occur as magnetiterich calciummagnesian skarn replacements whose location and orientation are strongly influenced by major faults and by the chemistry of the carbonate rocks along the margins of the intrusions

  the copper mineralization in these skarn deposits is also dominated by chalcopyrite but higher bornite concentrations are common moreover gold occurs in significant concentrations in all of the districts ore bodies though rarely visible to the naked eye these gold concentrations usually occur as inclusions within the copper sulphide minerals though in some deposits can also be strongly associated with pyrite

  the following map which encompasses an area of approximately 42 square kilometers approximately 16 square miles indicates the relative positions and sizes of our reported reserve ore bodies and their locations

 

 

 

  the following diagram indicates the relative elevations in meters of our reported reserve ore bodies 

 

  the following chart illustrates our current plans for sequencing and producing each of our ore bodies and the years in which we currently expect that production of each ore body will begin and end our mine plan is subject to change based on a number of factors including the results of our exploration efforts 

during 2001 we mined an average of 684800 metric tons of material per day including ore and overburden we expect to mine approximately 786000 metric tons of material per day in 2002 and do not require any additional approvals for higher rates the following chart illustrates our current aggregate mill capacity our aggregate permitted mill capacity and our projected milling rates the decline in milling rates in 2015 reflects the expected completion date of openpit mining at the grasberg ore body we are continuing to develop mine plans to optimize production levels and to offset the anticipated decline in 2015 

 

exploration

  as a result of our joint venture arrangements rio tinto pays for 40 percent of our exploration and drilling costs in papua the joint ventures incurred total exploration costs of 144 million in 2001 and the joint ventures exploration budget for 2002 totals approximately 4 million as a result of continuing low commodity prices we have reduced our exploration program for 2002 to focus largely on available exploration data limited drilling during 2002 will be directed towards delineation of reserves adjacent to our deep ore zone

  in june 1998 we entered into a joint venture agreement to conduct exploration activities in pt nabire bakti minings contract of work area covering approximately 10 million acres in several blocks contiguous to pt freeport indonesias block b and one of eastern minerals blocks in papua rio tinto shares in 40 percent of our interest and costs in this exploration joint venture we and rio tinto can earn up to a 62 percent interest in the pt nabirie bakti mining contract of work by spending up to 21 million on exploration and other activities in the joint venture areas we have spent 157 million through december 31 2001

  field exploration activities in block b which includes the wabu ridge gold prospect as well as in the other contract of work areas of eastern minerals and pt nabire bakti mining have been temporarily suspended the suspensions are due to safety and security issues and uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest areas covered by the contracts of work and an indonesian law enacted in 1999 prohibiting openpit mining in forest preservation areas all of these areas are outside of our current mining operations area

milling and production

  the ore from our mines moves by a conveyor system to a series of ore passes through which it drops to our milling and concentrating complex located approximately 2900 meters above sea level at the mill the ore is crushed and ground and mixed in tanks with water and small amounts of flotation reagents where it is continuously agitated with air during this physical separation process copper gold and silverbearing particles rise to the top of the tanks and are collected and thickened into a concentrate the concentrate leaves the mill complex as a slurry consisting of approximately 65 percent solids by weight and is pumped through three parallel 115 kilometer pipelines to our coastal port site facility at amamapare where it is filtered dried and stored for shipping ships are loaded at dock facilities at the port until they draw their maximum water then move to deeper water where loading is completed from shuttling barges

  in early 1998 pt freeport indonesia completed construction on the fourth concentrator mill expansion pursuant to the expansion joint venture agreement in addition to funding its 40 percent share of all expansion costs including the fourth concentrator mill expansion rio tinto provided a 450 million nonrecourse loan to pt freeport indonesia for pt freeport indonesias share of the cost of the expansion in less than two and onehalf years beginning in 1998 pt freeport indonesia repaid the 450 million loan plus interest from its share of incremental cash flow attributable to the expansion operating nonexpansion capital and administrative costs are shared proportionately between pt freeport indonesia and rio tinto based on the ratio of a the incremental revenues from production from the expansion and b total revenues from production from block a including production from pt freeport indonesias previously existing reserves pt freeport indonesia receives 100 percent of the cash flow from specified annual amounts of copper gold and silver production through 2021 and will receive 60 percent of all remaining cash flow thereafter

  our production results for the last three years are as follows

 

 

   mill throughput averaged a record 237800 metric tons of ore per day during 2001 in may 2000 pt freeport indonesia in consultation with the government of indonesia voluntarily agreed to temporarily limit grasberg openpit production because of an incident at its wanagon overburden stockpile normal overburden placement at the wanagon overburden stockpile resumed and the restriction on production from the grasberg open pit was lifted at the end of 2000 see wanagon overburden stockpile slippage

  copper production remained relatively unchanged over the past three years as the record throughput rates were offset by lower ore grades gold production has fluctuated primarily because of variances in ore grades and is expected to decline in 2002 because of lower projected ore grades than those mined in 2001 average net cash production costs per pound of copper were a recordlow 007 per pound in 2001 primarily because of higher credits from gold sales and because of lower site production costs for more information regarding our operating and financial results see item 6 selected financial data and items 7 and 7a managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

infrastructure improvements

  the location of our mining operations in a remote area requires that our operations be virtually selfsufficient in addition to the mining facilities described above in the course of the development of our project we have constructed ourselves or participated with others in the construction of an airport a port a 119 kilometer road an aerial tramway a hospital and related medical facilities and two town sites with housing schools and other facilities sufficient to support more than 17000 persons

  in 1996 we completed a significant infrastructure program which includes various residential community and commercial facilities we designed the program to provide the infrastructure needed for our operations to enhance the living conditions of our employees and to develop and promote the growth of local and other third party activities and enterprises in papua we have developed the facilities through joint ventures or direct ownership involving local indonesian interests and other investors

  from december 1993 to march 1997 pt freeport indonesia sold 2700 million of infrastructure assets to joint ventures owned onethird by pt freeport indonesia and twothirds by pt alatief nusakarya corporation alatief an indonesian investor funding for the purchases consisted of 900 million in equity contributions by the joint venture partners a 600 million bank loan and fcxs 934 senior notes which were repaid in 2001 pt freeport indonesia subsequently sold its onethird interest in the joint ventures to alatief in march 1997 in september 1998 pt freeport indonesia reacquired for 30 million an aggregate onethird interest in the joint ventures during 2000 pt freeport indonesia purchased the remaining interest in the joint ventures for 259 million cash and the assumption of 341 million of bank debt

  in december 1997 we sold the new coalfired power plant facilities associated with the fourth concentrator mill expansion for 3664 million to the joint venture that owns the power plants that already provided electricity to us the purchase price included 1232 million for rio tintos share of the new power plant facilities asset sales to the power joint venture totaled 5814 million through 1997 including 4582 million of assets we owned we subsequently sold our 30 percent interest in the joint venture to the other partners and we purchase power under infrastructure asset financing arrangements pursuant to a power sales agreement

marketing

  pt freeport indonesia sells its copper concentrates which contain significant quantities of gold and silver under united states dollardenominated sales agreements mostly to companies in asia and europe and to international trading companies we sell substantially all of our budgeted production of copper concentrates under longterm contracts with the selling price based on world metals prices generally the london metal exchange settlement prices for grade a copper under these contracts initial billing occurs at the time of shipment and final settlement on the copper portion is generally based on average prices for a specified future period gold generally is sold at the average london bullion market association price for a specified month near the month of shipment

  revenues from concentrate sales are recorded net of royalties see contracts of work treatment and all refining charges including participation charges if applicable based on the market prices of metals and the impact of derivative financial instruments if any used to hedge against risks from metals price fluctuations moreover because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrates is unrecoverable as a result of the smelting process our revenues from concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances based on the quantity and value of these unrecoverable metals these allowances are a negotiated term of our contracts and vary by customer treatment and refining charges represent payments to smelters and refiners and are either fixed or in certain cases vary with the price of copper we sell some copper concentrates in the spot market see risk factors

  we have commitments including commitments from atlantic copper and pt smelting for essentially all of our estimated 2002 production at market prices we expect our share of sales for 2002 to approximate 15 billion pounds of copper and 21 million ounces of gold projected 2002 copper and gold sales reflect the expectation of higher average mill throughput rates than in 2001 and lower gold grades see risk factors

  pt freeport indonesia has a longterm contract through 2007 to provide atlantic copper with approximately 60 percent of its copper concentrate requirements at market prices pt freeport indonesias agreement with pt smelting provides for the supply of 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements necessary to reach the gresik smelters design capacity and substantially all of any incremental copper concentrate requirements that may be needed in excess of that amount for the first 15 years of pt smeltings operations beginning in december 1998 the treatment and refining charges on the majority of the concentrate pt freeport indonesia supplies will not fall below a specified minimum rate currently 023 per pound which has been the rate since commencement of operations in 1998 and is the expected rate for 2002 we anticipate that pt freeport indonesia will sell approximately 50 percent of its annual concentrate production to atlantic copper and pt smelting a recap of pt freeport indonesias aggregate percentage concentrate sales to its affiliates and to other parties for the last three years follows

 

investment in smelters

  our investment in smelters atlantic copper and pt smelting serves an important role in our concentrate marketing strategy approximately onehalf of pt freeport indonesias concentrate production is sold to its affiliated smelters atlantic copper and pt smelting and the remainder is sold to other customers

  treatment charges for smelting and refining copper concentrates represent a cost to pt freeport indonesia and income to atlantic copper and pt smelting however because we have integrated our upstream mining and milling and downstream smelting and refining operations we are able to achieve operating hedges which substantially offset the effect of changes in treatment charges for smelting and refining pt freeport indonesias copper concentrates for example while low smelting and refining charges will adversely affect the operating results of atlantic copper and pt smelting low charges will benefit the operating results to pt freeport indonesias mining operations

  as a result changes in smelting and refining charges do not have a significant impact on our consolidated operating results taking into account taxes and minority ownership interests an equivalent change in the charges pt freeport indonesia pays and the charges atlantic copper and pt smelting receive would essentially offset in our consolidated operating results

atlantic copper sa

  we own 100 percent of atlantic copper atlantic copper completed the last expansion of its production capacity in 1997 and its smelter currently has a design capacity of 290000 metric tons of copper per year during 2001 atlantic copper treated 891100 metric tons of concentrate and produced 280000 metric tons of new copper anodes production for 2001 was negatively impacted by a scheduled 27day major maintenance turnaround in april 2001 the next scheduled major maintenance turnaround is not anticipated for three years atlantic copper purchased approximately 63 percent of its 2001 concentrate requirements from pt freeport indonesia at market prices we have no present plans to expand atlantic coppers production capacity atlantic copper has experienced no material operating problems and we are not aware of any potential material environmental liabilities at atlantic copper

  we contributed 76 million to atlantic copper during 2001 324 million in 2000 and 400 million in 1999 the funds are intended to strengthen atlantic coppers financial structure during this period of extremely low treatment and refining charge rates our total investment in atlantic copper through december 31 2001 totaled 2199 million

pt smelting

  pt freeport indonesia owns 25 percent of pt smelting during 2001 pt smelting treated 702900 metric tons of concentrate and produced 217500 metric tons of new copper anodes pt smelting has no present plans to expand its treatment capacity and has experienced no material operating problems we are not aware of any potential material environmental liabilities at pt smelting

  pt smelting is a joint venture among pt freeport indonesia mitsubishi materials corporation mitsubishi corporation and nippon mining  metals co ltd which own 25 percent 605 percent 95 percent and 5 percent respectively of the outstanding pt smelting common stock pt freeport indonesia is providing nearly all of pt smeltings copper concentrate requirements pt freeport indonesia agreed to assign its earnings in pt smelting to support a 13 percent cumulative annual return to the other owners for the first 20 years of operations pt freeport indonesias total investment in pt smelting through december 31 2001 totaled 964 million

competition

  we compete with other mining companies in the sale of our mineral concentrates and the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel some competing companies possess financial resources equal to or greater than ours and possess multiple mining assets less geographically concentrated in a single area than ours we believe however that we are the lowest cost copper producer in the world taking into account customary credits for related gold and silver production which we believe gives us a significant competitive advantage

social development employment and human rights

  we have a social employment and human rights policy to ensure that we operate in compliance with the laws in the areas of our operations and in a manner that respects basic human rights and the culture of the people who are indigenous to the area we continue to incur significant costs on social and cultural activities primarily in papua these activities include

comprehensive job training programs basic education programs several public health programs including extensive malaria control agricultural assistance programs a business incubator program to encourage the local people to establish their own small scale businesses cultural preservation programs charitable donations   in 1996 pt freeport indonesia agreed to commit at least one percent of its revenues for the following 10 years to the freeport fund for irian jaya development to support villagebased health education economic and social development programs in its area of operations this commitment replaced our community development programs in which we spent a similar amount of money each year we contributed 141 million in 2001 141 million in 2000 and 147 million in 1999 to the freeport fund for irian jaya development

  lembaga pengembangan masyarakatirian jaya or the peoples development foundationirian jaya oversees disbursement of the funds we contribute to the freeport fund for irian jaya development the foundations board of directors is made up of the head of the local government currently a kamoro a leader of the amungme people a leader of the kamoro people and leaders of the three local churches

  we believe that our social and economic development programs are responsive to the issues raised by the local villages and people and should help us to avoid disruptions of mining operations nevertheless social and political instability in the area may adversely impact our mining operations see risk factors

  in december 2000 we endorsed the joint us state departmentbritish foreign office voluntary principles on human rights and security several major natural resources companies and important human rights organizations also endorsed the voluntary principles we participated in drafting these principles with all of the parties involved and incorporated them into our social and human rights policy

environmental matters

  we have an environmental policy that commits us not only to compliance with applicable federal state and local environmental statutes and regulations but also to continuous improvement of our environmental performance at every operational site we believe that we conduct our indonesian operations pursuant to all necessary permits and are in compliance in all material respects with applicable indonesian environmental laws rules and regulations

  mining operations on the scale of our operations in papua involve significant environmental challenges primarily related to the disposition of tailings which are the crushed and ground rock material resulting from the physical separation of commercially valuable minerals from the ore we have comprehensive ongoing environmental monitoring and management plans for the disposal of tailings resulting from our milling operations which have been approved by the government of indonesia pursuant to these plans we manage and monitor the impact of our tailings disposal on the ecosystem of the ajkwa river and the ecosystems of adjoining water bodies and the surrounding coastal areas in 1997 we completed an engineered levee system to minimize the impact of the tailings through a controlled deposition area located on a portion of the flood plain on the ajkwa river we will revegetate and reclaim the deposition area when our mining operations are completed

  in furtherance of our commitments to the indonesian government pursuant to our tailings plan we monitor the acidneutralizing capacity of tailings on a daily basis to ensure the discharge of nonacid generating tailings into our tailings deposition area the net acidneutralizing capacity of our tailings discharge is maintained through a managed program of blending underground ore with ore from the open pit the addition of supplemental limestone or lime to the ore blend and the addition of lime for control of the ph levels in the flotation system daily samples are collected and tested and this data is communicated to our mill operations so that adjustments in ore blending and limelimestone addition can be made as appropriate

  with respect to waste rock acid rock drainage is our primary environmental issue our approaches to this issue include the mitigation of acid rock drainage generation the control of acid rock drainage migration and the capture and treatment of acid rock drainage emanating from the stockpile in addition tests have shown the feasibility of revegetating the stockpile and as a result we have engaged in stockpile reclamation as an additional means of mitigating acid rock drainage

  we have made significant capital expenditures with respect to the capture and treatment of acid rock drainage and additional capital expenditures are currently in progress in addition we are in the process of developing and implementing technology for the treatment of captured acid rock drainage in the interim acid rock drainage collected by boreholes near the base of the stockpile is neutralized

  we have committed to independent external environmental audits of our papua operations by qualified experts every three years with the results to be made public the second such audit was completed in 1999 the second audit reported that we continue to be in material compliance with indonesian environmental laws and regulations and that we had fulfilled the recommendations in the 1996 audit report the 1999 external audit report made some additional environmental management recommendations that are being implemented the report concluded that our environmental management systems achieve the standard of practice for worldclass mines the auditors also found our environmental management systems to be exemplary and a showcase for the mining industry we also are continuing our annual internal audits through the life of our mining operations so that our environmental management and monitoring programs will remain sound and our operations will remain in material compliance with local laws

  we have environmental approvals from the government of indonesia to expand our milling rate up to a maximum of 300000 metric tons of ore per day in 2001 we averaged 237800 metric tons of ore per day and we expect to average 245000 metric tons of ore per day in 2002

  the costs of complying with environmental laws is a fundamental cost of our business we incurred aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs totaling 782 million in 2001 1061 million in 2000 and 733 million in 1999 including tailings management levee maintenance and mine reclamation in 2002 we expect to incur approximately 11 million of environmental capital expenditures and 40 million of other environmental costs these environmental capital expenditures are part of our 170 million overall 2002 capital expenditure budget

  upon the completion of our mining operations we will fulfill the remaining commitments we made to the indonesian government in connection with our tailings management plan our options for revegetation of affected areas of the deposition area will include forage crops and grasses fruits grains and vegetables and other traditional food and medicinal crops decisions on these options will be made after consultation with local and regional government and local residents in addition to the revegetation and reclamation of the deposition area we will continue to operate our wastewater treatment plants as long as necessary we will also monitor and test the water discharged from our mine and the ph sulfate and electrical conductivity levels of ground water in the deposition area in addition we will provide flood protection to surrounding areas by diverting the ajkwa and otomona rivers and enhancing levee embankments the stability of our levees will be ensured through periodic visual inspection revegetation of the levee embankments and the transfer of our levee roads for public use moreover we will submit an annual written report to the indonesian government regarding our reclamation activities

  our ultimate reclamation and closure activities will be determined after consultation with the indonesian government affected local residents and other affected parties thus we cannot currently project with precision the ultimate amount of reclamation and closure costs we will incur our best estimate at this time is that pt freeport indonesias total reclamation and closure costs may require in excess of 100 million but are not expected to exceed 150 million estimates of reclamation and closure costs involve complex issues requiring integrated assessments over a period of many years and are subject to revision over time as we perform more complete studies some reclamation costs will be incurred during mining activities while most closure costs and the remaining reclamation costs will be incurred at the end of mining activities which are currently estimated to continue for more than 30 years

  moreover we cannot predict with any certainty the ultimate future uses of the deposition area once our mining operations are completed in addition to forage crop and grass planting and food and medicinal crop production possible future uses of the deposition area include rainforest production production of timber fuel woods fruits and nuts and other economic forestry and the cultivation of fish shellfish and other aquaculture the ultimate future uses of the deposition area will be determined after consultation with local and regional government and local residents

  in 1996 we began contributing approximately 06 million annually to a cash fund 33 million balance at december 31 2001 designed to accumulate at least 100 million by the end of our indonesian mining activities we plan to use this fund including accrued interest to pay for mine closure and reclamation costs any incremental costs in excess of the 100 million fund are expected to be incurred throughout the life of the mine and would be funded by operational cash flow or the sale of assets as needed an increasing emphasis on environmental issues and future changes in regulations could require us to incur additional costs that would be charged against future operations estimates involving environmental matters are by their nature imprecise and changes in government regulations operations technology and inflation could require us to revise them over time

  in 1998 a court in huelva spain found an employee of atlantic copper guilty of a criminal offense against the environment in connection with atlantic coppers transportation and use of weak acid and spent electrolyte at a facility owned and operated by minas de rio tinto sal the court fined the employee approximately 48000 the huelva court ruling which is currently on appeal did not prohibit atlantic coppers huelva complex from continuing to engage in these operations moreover atlantic coppers weak acid and spent electrolyte transport and use operations have been authorized by spanish environmental regulators in response to the huelva court decision atlantic copper has voluntarily constructed an onsite plant for the treatment of weak acid and recycling of spent electrolyte since june 2001 no weak acid or spent electrolyte has been sent to the minas de rio tinto facilities

  we believe that atlantic coppers facilities and operations are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable spanish environmental laws rules and regulations during 1999 atlantic copper achieved iso 14001 certification for its two remaining uncertified facilities in addition environmental management systems at all of atlantic coppers facilities have been validated as being in compliance with the european union regulation on environmental ecomanagement and ecoauditing

  the indonesian and spanish governments may periodically revise their environmental laws and regulations or adopt new ones and we cannot predict the effects on our operations of new or revised regulations we have expended significant resources both financial and managerial to comply with environmental regulations and permitting and approval requirements and we anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future there can be no assurance that we will not incur additional significant costs and liabilities to comply with such current and future regulations or that such regulations will not have a material effect on our operations see risk factors

wanagon overburden stockpile slippage

  in may 2000 a slippage occurred in the overburden waste stockpile at the wanagon basin following a period of excessive rainfall causing a wave of water and material to overflow from the basin four employees of a contractor to pt freeport indonesia were working in the area and perished contained within the mud were the treatment solids from the lime precipitation of acid rock drainage which then entered the tailings river system near the village of banti pt freeport indonesia charged 29 million to its 2000 production costs primarily for assets lost as a result of the incident in addition we incurred environmental costs for overburden disposition stockpile stabilization laboratory testing and consulting studies relating to the wanagon overburden waste stockpile

  sampling and monitoring were initiated at a number of stations covering the entire tailings system between the mine and estuary a specific risk analysis was conducted as a result of this event and was based on the monitoring program no longterm environmental effects were found from the direct monitoring nor predicted by the risk assessment the slippage caused a flow of sediments containing elevated levels of precipitated copper as a result water quality in the river was temporarily diminished due to higher levels of total suspended solids according to water quality tests the preslippage water quality in the river was substantially reestablished by the following day and was fully reestablished within 22 days after the incident

  pt freeport indonesia engaged international experts and outside consultants led by a team from the institute of technology of bandung indonesia to conduct a comprehensive study of the cause of the slippage and to recommend a future course of action working with the close cooperation of the indonesian department of energy and natural resources and also bapedal the indonesian environmental protection agency the company initiated a stockpile stabilization program and voluntarily agreed to a temporary limitation on average production from the grasberg open pit of 200000 tons per day underground ore production was not affected a safezone based on engineering calculations was subsequently identified along the wanagon river and within the village of banti the residents within this zone were temporarily moved to tembagapura our original mining town site and the houses were removed these families were relocated to new housing designed according to their wishes and located on higher ground in banti

  after successful completion of the stabilization program and consultation with affected local residents and with the approval of the indonesian government normal overburden placement at the wanagon stockpile resumed and the restriction on production from the grasberg open pit was lifted at the end of 2000

employees and relationship with fm services company

  as of december 31 2001 pt freeport indonesia had 7488 employees approximately 98 percent indonesian in addition as of december 31 2001 pt freeport indonesia had 1672 contract workers the vast majority of whom were indonesian approximately 46 percent of our indonesian employees are members of the all indonesia workers union which operates under government of indonesia supervision pt freeport indonesia has a labor agreement covering its hourlypaid indonesian employees the key provisions of which are renegotiated biannually pt freeport indonesias labor agreement was scheduled to expire on september 30 2001 in june 2001 pt freeport indonesia and its workers agreed to terms for a new labor agreement that expires september 30 2003 pt freeport indonesias relations with the workers union have generally been positive

  as of december 31 2001 atlantic copper had 731 employees of which approximately 76 percent are covered by a union contract that expires december 31 2002 atlantic copper experienced no work stoppages in 2001 and relations with these unions have also generally been good

  fm services company a delaware corporation 50 percent owned by us as of december 31 2001 has furnished executive administrative financial accounting legal tax and similar services to us we reimburse fm services at its cost including allocated overhead for these services on a monthly basis as of december 31 2001 fcx had 16 employees and fm services had 142 employees fm services employees also provide services to two other publicly traded companies

the terrorist attacks in the united states on september 11 2001 as well as the united statesled response and the potential for additional future terrorist acts have created economic and political uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our business and the prices of our securities

  the terrorist attacks that took place in the united states on september 11 2001 as well as the united statesled response to such attacks and the potential for additional future terrorist acts have caused uncertainty in the worlds financial and insurance markets and may significantly increase political economic and social instability in the geographic areas in which we operate including the republic of indonesia where our primary operating assets are located moreover there have been antiamerican demonstrations in certain sections of indonesia reportedly led by radical islamic activists radical activists have also threatened to attack foreign assets and have called for the expulsion of united states and british citizens and companies from indonesia

  it is possible that further acts of terrorism may be directed against the united states domestically or abroad and such acts of terrorism could be directed against properties and personnel of companies such as ours the attacks and the resulting economic and political uncertainties including the potential for further terrorist acts may cause the premiums charged for our insurance coverages to increase dramatically and may cause some coverages to be unavailable altogether these developments may materially and adversely affect our business and profitability and the prices of our securities in ways we cannot predict at this time

because our primary operating assets are located in the republic of indonesia our business may be adversely affected by indonesian political economic and social uncertainties beyond our control in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in a foreign country

  maintaining a good working relationship with the indonesian government is important to us because all of our mining operations are located in indonesia and are conducted pursuant to contracts of work with the indonesian government for a discussion of the risks relating to our contracts of work see the risk factor below

  indonesia continues to face political and economic uncertainties including separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces in particular social economic and political instability in the province of papua where our mining operations are located could have a material adverse impact on us if this instability results in damage to our property or interruption of our activities

  with the approval of the indonesian government we have temporarily suspended our field exploration activities outside of block a due to safety and security issues and uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest areas covered by the contracts of work and an indonesian law enacted in 1999 prohibiting openpit mining in forest preservation areas

  in august 1998 we suspended operations for three days at our grasberg mine in response to a wildcat work stoppage not authorized by the workers union by a group of workers a majority of whom were employees of our contractors the workers cited employment issues as the reasons for their work stoppage in march 1996 local people engaged in acts of vandalism that caused approximately 3 million of damages to our property and caused us to close the grasberg mine and mill for three days as a precautionary measure

  several separatist groups are opposing indonesian rule over papua and have sought political independence for the province in response to the demands for political independence from indonesia new regional autonomy laws became effective january 1 2001 however the manner in which these new autonomy laws will be implemented and the degree of political and economic autonomy that is being provided to individual provinces including papua is uncertain and is a current issue in indonesian politics

  in papua there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the indonesian military for example on september 29 2001 a group of separatists set fire to facilities and took over an airfield in ilaga papua which is approximately 50 miles northeast of our mining operations and separated by a rugged 14000foot mountain range through which there are no roads the separatists occupied the airfield for three days after which indonesian security forces successfully reclaimed the airfield

  we are also subject to the usual risks associated with conducting business in a foreign country including the risk of forced modification of existing contracts changes in the countrys laws or policies including laws or policies relating to taxation royalties imports exports and currency and the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or having to enforce the judgment of a foreign court or arbitration panel against a sovereign nation within its own territory in addition we are subject to the risk of expropriation and our insurance policies do not provide coverage for losses caused by expropriation

our contracts of work are subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations and if a dispute arises we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or panel in addition unless the indonesian government permits us to suspend activities under our contracts of work we are required to continue those activities or potentially be declared in default

  pt freeport indonesias and eastern minerals contracts of work were entered into under indonesias 1967 foreign capital investment law which provides guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization our contracts of work can be terminated by the government of indonesia if we do not satisfy our contractual obligations which include the payment of royalties and taxes to the government and the satisfaction of certain mining environmental safety and health requirements indonesian government officials have periodically raised questions regarding our compliance with indonesian environmental laws and regulations and the terms of the contracts of work in order to address these questions the government of indonesia formed a factfinding team in 2000 that reviewed our compliance with all aspects of pt freeport indonesias contract of work it is uncertain if or when the indonesian government will release its report on its investigation in addition we cannot assure you that the indonesian governments report if and when released will conclude that we are in compliance with all of the provisions of pt freeport indonesias contract of work

  moreover in recent years certain government officials and others in indonesia have called into question the validity of contracts entered into by the government of indonesia prior to october 1999 including pt freeport indonesias contract of work which was signed in december 1991 we cannot assure you that the validity of or our compliance with the terms of the contracts of work will not be challenged for political or other reasons pt freeport indonesias and eastern minerals contracts of work require that disputes with the indonesian government be submitted to international arbitration notwithstanding the international arbitration provision if a dispute arises under the contracts of work we face the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or having to enforce the judgment of a foreign court or arbitration panel against indonesia within its own territory

  in addition our contracts of work permit us to suspend activities under the contracts for a period of one year by making a written request to the indonesian government these suspension requests are subject to the approval of the indonesian government and are renewable annually if we do not request a suspension or are denied a suspension then we are required to continue our activities under the contract of work or potentially be declared in default moreover if a suspension continues for more than one year for reasons other than force majeure and the indonesian government has not approved such continuation then the indonesian government would be entitled to declare a default under the contract of work

servicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors some of which are beyond our control

  our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow this to a significant extent is subject to commodity prices and general economic financial regulatory political and other factors that are beyond our control in addition our ability to borrow funds in the future to service our debt will depend on our meeting the financial covenants in our amended bank credit facilities and other debt agreements we may have in the future future borrowings may not be available to us under our amended bank credit facilities or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund other liquidity needs as a result we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our debt on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition

  political and economic conditions in indonesia have had a negative effect on our credit ratings the major credit rating agencies have generally had a policy of limiting the credit ratings of companies with operations limited to a particular country to the credit rating for the sovereign debt of that country the current sovereign credit ratings of indonesia are b3 by moodys investors service and ccc by standard  poors and our credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt are currently b3 by moodys investors service and ccc by standard  poors

  our current credit ratings have an impact on the availability and cost of capital to us as a result in connection with our amended bank credit facilities we have agreed to apply our future cash flows after servicing scheduled payments of other debt funding permitted capital expenditures and paying operating and other costs to reducing amounts owed to the banks

  although our amended credit facilities do not restrict our ability to use funds for exploration and will not preclude us from funding our anticipated exploration budget the amended facilities do impose annual limitations on pt freeport indonesias capital expenditures that limit the amount of funds we can use to develop new projects these annual limitations are approximately 171 million for 2002 188 million for 2003 128 million for 2004 and 136 million 2005 if our capital expenditures in any year are less than 80 of the annual limitation for the year then the unused amount for the year below 80 may be carried forward to the next two succeeding years provided that the unused amount may only be used for deferred mining projects while pt freeport indonesias currently anticipated capital requirements do not exceed those limitations funding significant new projects would require us to seek alternate sources of capital the availability and cost of capital for projects in indonesia is uncertain because of global financial markets assessment of indonesias political and economic conditions

covenants in our amended credit facilities impose restrictions on us

  our amended bank credit facilities

prohibit the repurchase of and payment of dividends on our common stock limit among other things our ability to redeem and pay dividends on our preferred stock in certain circumstances make investments engage in transactions with affiliates and create liens on our assets and

require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests   events beyond our control including changes in general economic and business conditions may affect our ability to satisfy these covenants which could result in a default under our amended bank credit facilities if an event of default under our amended credit facilities occurs the banks could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable an event of default under our amended bank credit facilities may also give rise to an event of default under our existing and future debt agreements

we have pledged substantially all of our assets to secure the repayment of our amended credit facilities and other obligations

  the repayment of our amended credit facilities is secured by a lien on over 80 of pt freeport indonesias assets and by our pledge of 501 and 100 of the outstanding capital stock of pt freeport indonesia and pt indocopper investama respectively pt freeport indonesias remaining assets secure other of our obligations in addition pt freeport indonesia has pledged it rights under its contract of work to secure its obligations under the amended credit facilities

  if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our repayment obligations our lenders could elect to foreclose on our pledged assets which would have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability

our mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges and future changes in environmental laws or unanticipated environmental impacts from our operations could require us to incur increased costs

  mining operations on the scale of our operations in papua involve significant environmental challenges our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of crushed and ground rock material called tailings that results from the process by which we physically separate the copper gold and silver from the ore that we mine under our tailings management plan the river system near our mine transports the tailings to the lowlands where deposits of the tailings and natural sediments are controlled through a levee system for future revegetation and reclamation we incurred costs of 97 million in 2001 82 million in 2000 and 117 million in 1999 for our tailings management plan

  another of our major environmental challenges is managing overburden which is the rock that must be moved aside in order to reach the ore in the mining process in the presence of air water and naturally occurring bacteria some overburden can cause acid rock drainage or acidic water containing dissolved metals which if not properly managed can have a negative impact on the environment

  certain indonesian governmental officials have from time to time raised issues with respect to our tailings management plan and overburden management plan including a suggestion that a pipeline system rather than our current system be implemented for tailings disposal our ongoing assessment of tailings management has identified significant unresolved technical environmental and economic issues associated with a pipeline system because our mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area a pipeline system would be costly difficult to construct and maintain and more prone to catastrophic failure for these reasons we do not believe that a pipeline system is practical

  we anticipate that we will continue to spend significant financial and managerial resources on environmental compliance in addition changes in indonesian environmental laws or unanticipated environmental impacts from our operations could require us to incur significant additional costs

the volume and grade of the reserves we recover and our rates of production may be more or less than anticipated in addition we do not anticipate the mining of all of our reserves prior to the expiration of the initial term of our contract of work

  our reserve amounts are determined in accordance with established mining industry practices and standards but are only estimates of the mineral deposits that can be economically and legally recovered in addition our mines may not conform to standard geological expectations because ore bodies do not contain uniform grades of minerals our metal recovery rates will vary from time to time which will result in variations in the volumes of minerals that we can sell from period to period some of our reserves may become unprofitable to develop if there are unfavorable longterm market price fluctuations in copper and gold or if there are significant increases in our operating and capital costs in addition our exploration programs may not result in the discovery of additional mineral deposits that we can mine profitably

  all of our current proven and probable reserves including the grasberg deposit are located in block a the initial term of our contract of work covering block a expires at the end of 2021 we can extend this term for two successive 10year periods subject to the approval of the indonesian government which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably our reserve amounts reflect our estimates of the reserves that can be recovered before 2041 ie before the expiration of the two 10year extensions and our current mine plan has been developed and our operations are based on our receiving the two 10year extensions as a result we do not anticipate the mining of all of our reserves prior to the end of 2021 based on our current mine plan and there can be no assurance that the indonesian government will approve the extensions prior to the end of 2021 we expect to mine approximately 63 percent of aggregate proven and probable ore representing approximately 71 percent of pt freeport indonesias share of recoverable copper reserves and approximately 77 percent of pt freeport indonesias share of recoverable gold reserves

our net income can vary significantly with fluctuations in the market prices of copper and gold

  our revenues are derived primarily from the sale of copper concentrates which also contain significant amounts of gold and from the sale of copper cathodes copper wire rod and copper wire most of our copper concentrates are sold under longterm contracts but the selling price is based on world metal prices at or near the time of shipment and delivery

  copper and gold prices fluctuated widely in 2001 primarily due to the slowdown in global economic activity and the economic and political uncertainties created by the terrorist attacks in the united states on september 11 2001 during 2001 the daily closing price for copper on the london spot market ranged from 60 cents per pound to 83 cents per pound and the daily closing price for gold on the london spot market ranged from 256 per ounce to 293 per ounce

  world metal prices for copper have historically fluctuated widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control including

the strength of the united states economy and the economies of other industrialized and developing nations available supplies of copper from mine production and inventories sales by holders and producers of copper demand for industrial products containing copper and speculation   world gold prices have also historically fluctuated widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control including

the strength of the united states economy and the economies of other industrialized and developing nations global or regional political or economic crises the relative strength of the united states dollar and other currencies expectations with respect to the rate of inflation interest rates sales of gold by central banks and other holders demand for jewelry containing gold and speculation   any material decrease in market prices of copper or gold would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition

in addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry we face additional risks because our operations are located on difficult terrain in a very remote area of the world

  our mining operations are located in steeply mountainous terrain in a very remote area in indonesia these conditions have required us to overcome special engineering difficulties and to develop extensive infrastructure facilities in addition the area receives considerable rainfall which has led to periodic floods and mud slides the mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time in addition to these special risks we are also subject to the usual risks associated with the mining industry such as the risk of encountering unexpected geological conditions that may result in caveins and flooding of mine areas our insurance coverages may not be sufficient to cover an unexpected natural or operating disaster our insurance policies do not provide coverage for damages and losses caused by war moreover while our property and business interruption insurance policy currently provides coverage for damages to insured property directly caused by terrorism this policy in the future may in view of the events of september 11 2001 exclude such coverage

movements in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates could have a negative effect on our operating results

  all of our revenues are denominated in us dollars however some of our costs and some of our assets and liabilities are denominated in indonesian rupiah australian dollars or euros as a result our profitability is generally adversely affected when the us dollar weakens against these foreign currencies

  the indonesian rupiahus dollar exchange rate was volatile during 2001 the rupiahus dollar daily closing exchange rate ranged from 8470 rupiahs per us dollar to 11980 rupiahs per us dollar during 2001 and on december 31 2001 the closing exchange rate was 10160 rupiahs per us dollar the australian dollarus dollar and eurous dollar exchange rates also fluctuated substantially in 2001 during 2001 the australian dollarus dollar daily closing exchange rate ranged from 048 per australian dollar to 057 per australian dollar and the eurous dollar daily closing exchange rate ranged from 084 per euro to 096 per euro on december 31 2001 the closing exchange rates were 051 per australian dollar and 088 per euro

  from time to time we have in the past and may in the future implement currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates however our hedging strategies may not be successful and any of our unhedged foreign exchange payment requirements will continue to be subject to market fluctuations in addition our amended bank credit facilities are based on fluctuating interest rates accordingly an increase in interest rates could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition

because we are primarily a holding company our ability to pay our debts depends upon the ability of our subsidiaries to pay us dividends and to advance us funds in addition our ability to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries assets is generally subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries creditors

  because we conduct business primarily through pt freeport indonesia our major subsidiary and other subsidiaries our ability to pay our debts depends upon the earnings and cash flow of pt freeport indonesia and our other subsidiaries and their ability to pay us dividends and to advance us funds contractual and legal restrictions applicable to our subsidiaries could also limit our ability to obtain cash from them our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries assets upon their liquidation reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries creditors including trade creditors and preferred stockholders if any

  yosefa alomang v freeportmcmoran inc and freeportmcmoran copper  gold inc  civ no 969962 orleans civ dist ct la filed june 19 1996 the plaintiff alleges environmental human rights and socialcultural violations in indonesia and seeks unspecified monetary damages and other equitable relief in march 2000 the civil district court for the parish of orleans state of louisiana granted our exception of no cause of action and dismissed the entire case with prejudice the plaintiff appealed to the louisiana fourth circuit court of appeal and in february 2002 the louisiana fourth circuit court of appeal affirmed the lower courts dismissal of the case with prejudice

  in addition to the foregoing proceeding we are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings of a character normally incident to the ordinary course of our business we believe that potential liability in such proceedings would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations we maintain liability insurance to cover some but not all potential liabilities normally incident to the ordinary course of our business as well as other insurance coverage customary in our business with coverage limits that we deem prudent
