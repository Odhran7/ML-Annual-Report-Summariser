mcdonald’s corporation the registrant together with its subsidiaries is referred to herein as the “company” 

a general 

for the year ended december 31 2018  there were no material changes to the companys corporate structure or in its method of conducting business the business was structured with segments that combine markets with similar characteristics and opportunities for growth significant reportable segments included the united states us international lead markets and high growth markets in addition throughout this report we present the foundational markets  corporate segment which includes markets in over 80 countries as well as corporate activities 

as detailed in the companys form 8k filed with the us securities and exchange commission sec on september 24 2018 the company announced changes to its global operating structure effective january 1 2019 refer to the segment and geographic information section included in part ii item 8 page 49 of this form 10k for additional information 

b narrative description of business 

 the company operates and franchises mcdonald’s restaurants which serve a locallyrelevant menu of quality food and beverages in more than 100 countries mcdonald’s franchised restaurants are owned and operated under one of the following structures  conventional franchise developmental license or affiliate the optimal ownership structure for an individual restaurant trading area or market country is based on a variety of factors including the availability of individuals with the entrepreneurial experience and financial resources as well as the local legal and regulatory environment in critical areas such as property ownership and franchising we continually review our mix of companyowned and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance with a goal to be approximately 95 franchised over the long term the business relationship between mcdonald’s and its independent franchisees is supported by adhering to standards and policies and is of fundamental importance to overall performance and to protecting the mcdonald’s brand 

the company is primarily a franchisor with approximately 93 of mcdonalds restaurants currently owned and operated by independent franchisees franchising enables an individual to be his or her own employer and maintain control over all employment related matters marketing and pricing decisions while also benefiting from the strength of mcdonald’s global brand operating system and financial resources 

directly operating mcdonald’s restaurants contributes significantly to our ability to act as a credible franchisor one of the strengths of the franchising model is that the expertise from operating companyowned restaurants allows mcdonald’s to improve the operations and success of all restaurants while innovations from franchisees can be tested and when viable efficiently implemented across relevant restaurants having companyowned and operated restaurants provides company personnel with a venue for restaurant operations training experience in addition in our companyowned and operated restaurants and in collaboration with franchisees we are able to further develop and refine operating standards marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies that will ultimately benefit mcdonald’s restaurants 

conventional franchise 

under a conventional franchise arrangement the company generally owns the land and building or secures a longterm lease for the restaurant location and the franchisee pays for equipment signs seating and décor the company believes that ownership of real estate combined with the coinvestment by franchisees enables us to achieve restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry 

franchisees are also responsible for reinvesting capital in their businesses over time in addition to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives the company frequently coinvests with franchisees to fund improvements to their restaurants or their operating systems these investments developed in collaboration with franchisees are designed to cater to consumer preferences improve local business performance and increase the value of our brand through the development of modernized more attractive and higher revenue generating restaurants 

the company’s typical franchise term is 20 years the company requires franchisees to meet rigorous standards and generally does not work with passive investors the business relationship with franchisees is designed to facilitate consistency and high quality at all mcdonald’s restaurants conventional franchisees contribute to the company’s revenue primarily through the payment of rent and royalties based upon a percent of sales with specified minimum rent payments along with initial fees paid upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new franchise this structure enables mcdonald’s to generate significant levels of cash flow 

developmental license or affiliate 

under a developmental license or affiliate arrangement licensees are responsible for operating and managing the business providing capital including the real estate interest and developing and opening new restaurants the company generally does not invest any capital under a developmental license or affiliate arrangement and it receives a royalty based upon a percent of sales and generally will receive initial fees upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new term while developmental license and affiliate arrangements are largely the same affiliate arrangements are used in a limited number of foreign markets where the company also has an equity investment and records its share of net results in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 

 the company and its franchisees purchase food packaging equipment and other goods from numerous independent suppliers the company has established and enforces high food safety and quality standards the company has quality centers around the world designed to promote consistency of its high standards the quality assurance process not only involves ongoing product reviews but also 

  

mcdonalds corporation 2018 annual report 1 

onsite supplier visits a food safety advisory council composed of the company’s internal food safety experts as well as suppliers and outside academia provides strategic global leadership for all aspects of food safety we have ongoing programs to educate employees about food safety practices and our suppliers and restaurant operators participate in food safety trainings where we share best practices on food safety and quality in addition the company works closely with suppliers to encourage innovation and drive continuous improvement leveraging scale supply chain infrastructure and risk management strategies the company also collaborates with suppliers toward a goal of achieving competitive predictable food and paper costs over the long term 

independently owned and operated distribution centers approved by the company distribute products and supplies to mcdonald’s restaurants in addition restaurant personnel are trained in the proper storage handling and preparation of food for customers 

 mcdonald’s restaurants offer a substantially uniform menu although there are geographic variations to suit local consumer preferences and tastes in addition mcdonald’s tests new products on an ongoing basis 

mcdonald’s menu includes hamburgers and cheeseburgers big mac quarter pounder with cheese filetofish several chicken sandwiches chicken mcnuggets wraps french fries salads oatmeal shakes mcflurry desserts sundaes soft serve cones pies soft drinks coffee mccafé beverages and other beverages in addition the restaurants sell a variety of other products during limitedtime promotions 

mcdonald’s restaurants in the us and many international markets offer a full or limited breakfast menu breakfast offerings may include egg mcmuffin sausage mcmuffin with egg mcgriddles biscuit and bagel sandwiches and hotcakes 

quality choice and nutrition are increasingly important to our customers and we are continuously evolving our menu to meet our customers needs 

 mcdonald’s global brand is well known marketing promotional and public relations activities are designed to promote mcdonald’s brand and differentiate the company from competitors marketing and promotional efforts focus on value quality food taste menu choice nutrition convenience and the customer experience 

 the company owns or is licensed to use valuable intellectual property including trademarks service marks patents copyrights trade secrets and other proprietary information the company considers the trademarks “mcdonald’s” and “the golden arches logo” to be of material importance to its business depending on the jurisdiction trademarks and service marks generally are valid as long as they are used andor registered patents copyrights and licenses are of varying durations 

 the company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to any material degree 

 information about the company’s working capital practices is incorporated herein by reference to management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december 31 2018  2017 and 2016 in part ii item 7 pages 15 through 31 and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2018  2017 and 2016 in part ii item 8 page 35 of this form 10k 

 the company’s business is not dependent upon either a single customer or small group of customers 

 companyoperated restaurants have no backlog orders 

 no material portion of the business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at government election 

 mcdonald’s restaurants compete with international national regional and local retailers of food products the company competes on the basis of price convenience service menu variety and product quality in a highly fragmented global restaurant industry 

in measuring the company’s competitive position management reviews data compiled by euromonitor international a leading source of market data with respect to the global restaurant industry the company’s primary competition which is referred to as the informal eating out ieo segment includes the following restaurant categories defined by euromonitor international quickservice eating establishments casual dining fullservice restaurants street stalls or kiosks cafés100 home deliverytakeaway providers specialist coffee shops selfservice cafeterias and juicesmoothie bars the ieo segment excludes establishments that primarily serve alcohol and fullservice restaurants other than casual dining 

based on data from euromonitor international the global ieo segment was composed of approximately 9 million outlets and generated 13 trillion in annual sales in 2017  the most recent year for which data is available mcdonald’s systemwide 2017 restaurant business accounted for 04 of those outlets and 71 of the sales 

management also on occasion benchmarks mcdonald’s against the entire restaurant industry including the ieo segment defined above and all other fullservice restaurants based on data from euromonitor international the restaurant industry was composed of approximately 19 million outlets and generated 25 trillion in annual sales in 2017  mcdonald’s systemwide restaurant business accounted for 02 of those outlets and 37 of the sales 

mcdonalds corporation 2018 annual report 2 

 the company continuously endeavors to improve its social responsibility and environmental practices to achieve longterm sustainability which benefits mcdonald’s and the communities it serves 

increased focus by certain governmental authorities on environmental matters may lead to new governmental initiatives while we cannot predict the precise nature of these initiatives we expect that they may impact our business both directly and indirectly although the impact would likely vary by world region andor market we believe that adoption of new regulations may increase costs for the company also there is a possibility that governmental initiatives or actual or perceived effects of changes in weather patterns climate or water resources could have a direct impact on the operations of the company its franchisees and suppliers collectively referred to as the system in ways which we cannot predict at this time 

the company monitors developments related to environmental matters and plans to respond to governmental initiatives in a timely and appropriate manner in addition the company launched its scale for good framework in 2018 which includes the environmentalrelated pillars of climate action packaging and recycling and sustainable sourcing these include goals and initiatives to reduce system greenhouse gas emissions responsibly source ingredients and packaging and increase the availability of recycling in restaurants to reduce waste 

 the company’s number of employees worldwide including its corporate office employees and companyowned and operated restaurant employees was approximately 210000 as of yearend 2018

 item 1a risk factors and cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements 

  

tableend

  

the information in this report includes forwardlooking statements about future events and circumstances and their effects upon revenues expenses and business opportunities generally speaking any statement in this report not based upon historical fact is a forwardlooking statement forwardlooking statements can also be identified by the use of forwardlooking words such as “may” “will” “expect” “believe” “anticipate” and “plan” or similar expressions in particular statements regarding our plans strategies prospects and expectations regarding our business and industry including those under “outlook” are forwardlooking statements they reflect our expectations are not guarantees of performance and speak only as of the date of this report except as required by law we do not undertake to update them our expectations or the underlying assumptions may change or not be realized and you should not rely unduly on forwardlooking statements our business results are subject to a variety of risks including those that are reflected in the following considerations and factors as well as elsewhere in our filings with the sec if any of these considerations or risks materialize our expectations may change and our performance may be adversely affected 

if we do not successfully evolve and execute against our business strategies including under the velocity growth plan we may not be able to increase operating income 

to drive operating income growth our business strategies must be effective in maintaining and strengthening customer appeal delivering sustainable guest count growth and driving a higher average check whether these strategies are successful depends mainly on our system’s ability to 



  

mcdonalds corporation 2018 annual report 3 

 if we are delayed or unsuccessful in executing our strategies or if our strategies do not yield the desired results our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

our investments to enhance the customer experience including through technology may not generate the expected returns 

our longterm business objectives depend on the successful systemwide execution of our strategies we continue to build upon our investments in eotf which focus on restaurant modernization and technology as well as digital engagement and delivery in order to transform the customer experience as part of these investments we are placing renewed emphasis on improving our service model and strengthening relationships with customers in part through digital channels and loyalty initiatives as well as mobile ordering and payment systems we also continue to refine our delivery initiatives and partnerships which may not generate expected returns if these initiatives are not well executed or if we do not fully realize the intended benefits of these significant investments our business results may suffer 

if we do not anticipate and address evolving consumer preferences and effectively execute our pricing promotional and marketing plans our business could suffer 

our continued success depends on our system’s ability to retain regain and convert customers in order to do so we need to anticipate and respond effectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics and trends in food sourcing food preparation food offerings and consumer preferences in the “informal eating out” “ieo” segment if we are not able to quickly and effectively respond to these changes or our competitors respond more effectively our financial results could be adversely impacted 

our ability to retain regain and convert customers also depends on the impact of pricing promotional and marketing plans across the system and the ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly and effectively to evolving customer preferences as well as shifting economic and competitive conditions existing or future pricing strategies and the value proposition they represent are expected to continue to be important components of our business strategy however they may not be successful in retaining regaining and converting customers or may not be as successful as the efforts of our competitors and could negatively impact sales guest counts and market share 

additionally we operate in a complex and costly advertising environment our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful in retaining regaining and converting customers our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising and marketing resources across different channels allows us to reach our customers effectively if the advertising and marketing programs are not successful or are not as successful as those of our competitors our sales guest counts and market share could decrease 

failure to preserve the value and relevance of our brand could have an adverse impact on our financial results 

to be successful in the future we believe we must preserve enhance and leverage the value of our brand brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions those perceptions are affected by a variety of factors including the nutritional content and preparation of our food the ingredients we use our business practices and the manner in which we source the commodities we use consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons and some changes can occur rapidly for example nutritional health and other scientific studies and conclusions which constantly evolve and may have contradictory implications drive popular opinion litigation and regulation including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior in ways that affect the ieo segment or perceptions of our brand generally or relative to available alternatives consumer perceptions may also be affected by adverse commentary from third parties including through social media or conventional media outlets regarding the quickservice category of the ieo segment our brand our operations our suppliers or our franchisees if we are unsuccessful in addressing adverse commentary whether or not accurate our brand and our financial results may suffer 

additionally the ongoing relevance of our brand may depend on the success of our sustainability initiatives which require systemwide coordination and alignment if we are not effective in addressing social and environmental responsibility matters or achieving relevant sustainability goals consumer trust in our brand may suffer in particular business incidents or practices whether actual or perceived that erode consumer trust or confidence particularly if such incidents or practices receive considerable publicity or result in litigation can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results 

we face intense competition in our markets which could hurt our business 

we compete primarily in the ieo segment which is highly competitive we also face sustained intense competition from traditional fast casual and other competitors which may include many nontraditional market participants such as convenience stores grocery stores and coffee shops we expect our environment to continue to be highly competitive and our results in any particular reporting period may be impacted by new or continuing actions of our competitors which may have a short or longterm impact on our results 

we compete on the basis of product choice quality affordability service and location in particular we believe our ability to compete successfully in the current market environment depends on our ability to improve existing products develop new products price our products appropriately deliver a relevant customer experience manage the complexity of our restaurant operations and respond effectively to our competitors’ actions or disruptive actions from others which we do not foresee there can be no assurance these strategies will be effective and some strategies may be effective at improving some metrics while adversely affecting other metrics which could have the overall effect of harming our business 

mcdonalds corporation 2018 annual report 4 

unfavorable general economic conditions could adversely affect our business and financial results 

our results of operations are substantially affected by economic conditions which can vary significantly by market and can impact consumer disposable income levels and spending habits economic conditions can also be impacted by a variety of factors including hostilities epidemics and actions taken by governments to manage national and international economic matters whether through austerity stimulus measures or trade measures and initiatives intended to control wages unemployment credit availability inflation taxation and other economic drivers sustained adverse economic conditions or periodic adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets could pressure our operating performance and our business and financial results may suffer 

our results of operations are also affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and unfavorable currency fluctuations could adversely affect reported earnings 

supply chain interruptions may increase costs or reduce revenues 

we depend on the effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure reliable and sufficient supply of quality products on favorable terms although many of the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers in countries around the world certain products have limited suppliers which may increase our reliance on those suppliers supply chain interruptions including shortages and transportation issues and price increases can adversely affect us as well as our suppliers and franchisees whose performance may have a significant impact on our results such shortages or disruptions could be caused by factors beyond the control of our suppliers franchisees or us if we experience interruptions in our system’s supply chain our costs could increase and it could limit the availability of products critical to our system’s operations 

food safety concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

our ability to increase sales and profits depends on our system’s ability to meet expectations for safe food and on our ability to manage the potential impact on mcdonald’s of foodborne illnesses and food or product safety issues that may arise in the future food safety is a top priority and we dedicate substantial resources to offer safe food products to our customers including as our menu and service model evolve however food safety events including instances of foodborne illness occur within the food industry and our system from time to time and in addition could occur in the future instances of food tampering food contamination or foodborne illness whether actual or perceived could adversely affect our brand and reputation as well as our revenues and profits 

our franchise business model presents a number of risks 

as the companys business model has evolved to a more heavily franchised structure our success relies to large degree on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees including our developmental licensees and affiliates our restaurant margins arise from two sources fees from franchised restaurants eg rent and royalties based on a percentage of sales and to a lesser degree sales from companyoperated restaurants our franchisees and developmental licensees manage their businesses independently and therefore are responsible for the daytoday operation of their restaurants the revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales business risks affecting our operations also affect our franchisees if our franchisees do not experience sales growth our revenues and margins could be negatively affected as a result also if sales trends worsen for franchisees their financial results may deteriorate which could result in among other things restaurant closures or delayed or reduced payments to us 

our success also relies on the willingness and ability of our independent franchisees and affiliates to implement major initiatives which may include financial investment and to remain aligned with us on operating promotional and capitalintensive reinvestment plans the ability of franchisees to contribute to the achievement of our plans is dependent in large part on the availability to them of funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general by the creditworthiness of our franchisees or the company or by banks’ lending practices if our franchisees are unwilling or unable to invest in major initiatives or are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates or at all our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety or other operational problems or project an image inconsistent with our brand and values particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited costly to exercise or subjected to litigation and potential delays if franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards our brand’s image and reputation could be harmed which in turn could hurt our business and operating results 

our ownership mix also affects our results and financial condition the decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex the benefits of our more heavily franchised structure depends on various factors including whether we have effectively selected franchisees licensees andor affiliates that meet our rigorous standards whether we are able to successfully integrate them into our structure and whether their performance and the resulting ownership mix supports our brand and financial objectives 

challenges with respect to talent management could harm our business 

effective succession planning is important to our longterm success failure to effectively identify develop and retain key personnel recruit highquality candidates and facilitate smooth management and personnel transitions could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results 

  

mcdonalds corporation 2018 annual report 5 

challenges with respect to labor availability and cost could impact our business and results of operations 

our success depends in part on our system’s ability to proactively recruit motivate and retain a qualified workforce to work in our restaurants in an intensely competitive environment increased costs associated with recruiting motivating and retaining qualified employees to work in our companyoperated restaurants could have a negative impact on our companyoperated margins similar concerns apply to our franchisees 

we are also impacted by the costs and other effects of compliance with us and international regulations affecting our workforce which includes our staff and employees working in our companyoperated restaurants these regulations are increasingly focused on employment issues including wage and hour healthcare immigration retirement and other employee benefits and workplace practices claims of noncompliance with these regulations could result in liability and expense to us our potential exposure to reputational and other harm regarding our workplace practices or conditions or those of our independent franchisees or suppliers or perceptions thereof could have a negative impact on consumer perceptions of us and our business additionally economic action such as boycotts protests work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations could adversely affect us including our ability to recruit and retain talent or the franchisees and suppliers that are also part of the mcdonalds system and whose performance may have a material impact on our results 

information technology system failures or interruptions or breaches of network security may impact our operations 

we are increasingly reliant on technological systems such as pointofsale and other systems or platforms technologies supporting mcdonald’s digital and delivery solutions as well as technologies that facilitate communication and collaboration internally with affiliated entities customers employees or independent third parties to conduct our business including technologyenabled systems provided to us by third parties any failure of these systems could significantly impact our operations and customer experience and perceptions 

despite the implementation of security measures those technology systems and solutions could become vulnerable to damage disability or failures due to theft fire power loss telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events our increasing reliance on third party systems also present the risks faced by the third party’s business including the operational security and credit risks of those parties if those systems were to fail or otherwise be unavailable and we were unable to recover in a timely manner we could experience an interruption in our operations 

furthermore security breaches have from time to time occurred and may in the future occur involving our systems the systems of the parties we communicate or collaborate with including franchisees or those of third party providers these may include such things as unauthorized access denial of service computer viruses introduction of malware or ransomware and other disruptive problems caused by hackers our information technology systems contain personal financial and other information that is entrusted to us by our customers our employees and other third parties as well as financial proprietary and other confidential information related to our business an actual or alleged security breach could result in disruptions shutdowns theft or unauthorized disclosure of personal financial proprietary or other confidential information further the general data protection regulation “gdpr” requires entities processing the personal data of individuals in the european union to meet certain requirements regarding the handling of that data failure to meet gdpr requirements could result in substantial penalties and materially adversely impact our financial results the occurrence of any of these incidents could result in reputational damage adverse publicity loss of consumer confidence reduced sales and profits complications in executing our growth initiatives and regulatory and legal risk including criminal penalties or civil liabilities 

the global scope of our business subjects us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

we encounter differing cultural regulatory and economic environments within and among the more than 100 countries where mcdonald’s restaurants operate and our ability to achieve our business objectives depends on the systems success in these environments meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment and our global success is partially dependent on our system’s ability to leverage operating successes across markets and brand perceptions planned initiatives may not have appeal across multiple markets with mcdonalds customers and could drive unanticipated changes in customer perceptions and guest counts 

disruptions in operations or price volatility in a market can also result from governmental actions such as price foreign exchange or changes in traderelated tariffs or controls sanctions and counter sanctions governmentmandated closure of our franchisees’ or our suppliers’ operations and asset seizures the cost and disruption of responding to governmental investigations or inquiries whether or not they have merit or the impact of these other measures may impact our results and could cause reputational or other harm our international success depends in part on the effectiveness of our strategies and brandbuilding initiatives to reduce our exposure to such governmental investigations or inquiries 

additionally challenges and uncertainties are associated with operating in developing markets which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability economic volatility crime corruption and social and ethnic unrest such challenges may be exacerbated in many cases by a lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainties in how local law is applied and enforced including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment an inability to manage effectively the risks associated with our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

we may also face challenges and uncertainties in developed markets for example as a result of the uks decision to leave the european union through a negotiated exit over a period of time including its formal commencement of exit proceedings it is possible that there will be increased regulatory complexities as well as potential referenda in the uk andor other european countries that could cause uncertainty in european or worldwide economic conditions the decision created volatility in certain foreign currency exchange rates that may or may not continue any of these effects and others we cannot anticipate could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

mcdonalds corporation 2018 annual report 6 

changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the us and foreign jurisdictions and our operations plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives around the world in particular we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or policy or related authoritative interpretations we are also impacted by settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by taxing and governmental authorities inside and outside of the us in connection with our tax audits all of which will depend on their timing nature and scope any significant increases in income tax rates changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

changes in commodity and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

the profitability of our companyoperated restaurants depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs including food paper supplies fuel utilities and distribution and other operating costs including labor any volatility in certain commodity prices or fluctuation in labor costs could adversely affect our operating results by impacting restaurant profitability the commodity markets for some of the ingredients we use such as beef and chicken are particularly volatile due to factors such as seasonal shifts climate conditions industry demand international commodity markets food safety concerns product recalls and government regulation all of which are beyond our control and in many instances unpredictable we can only partially address future price risk through hedging and other activities and therefore increases in commodity costs could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

increasing regulatory complexity may adversely affect restaurant operations and our financial results 

our regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance and similar risks that could affect our operations and results in material ways in many of our markets we are subject to increasing regulation which has increased our cost of doing business we are affected by the cost compliance and other risks associated with the often conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations we face including where inconsistent standards imposed by multiple governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings 

our success depends in part on our ability to manage the impact of new potential or changing regulations that can affect our business plans and operations these regulations include product packaging marketing the nutritional content and safety of our food and other products labeling and other disclosure practices compliance efforts with those regulations may be affected by ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from thirdparty suppliers particularly given varying requirements and practices for testing and disclosure 

additionally we are working to manage the risks and costs to us our franchisees and our supply chain of the effects of climate change greenhouse gases and diminishing energy and water resources these risks include the increased public focus including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations on these and other environmental sustainability matters such as packaging and waste animal health and welfare deforestation and land use these risks also include the increased pressure to make commitments set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them these risks could expose us to market operational and execution costs or risks if we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with our complex regulatory environment it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

we are subject to increasing legal complexity and could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us 

increasing legal complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways we could be subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business including class actions administrative proceedings government investigations and proceedings employment and personal injury claims landlordtenant disputes disputes with current or former suppliers claims by current or former franchisees and intellectual property claims including claims that we infringed another party’s trademarks copyrights or patents regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are found to be liable claims may be expensive to defend and may divert managements attention away from operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition

given the company’s returns on incremental invested capital and significant cash provided by operations management believes it is prudent to reinvest in the business in markets with acceptable returns andor opportunity for longterm growth and use excess cash flow to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases the company has paid dividends on common stock for 43 consecutive years through 2018 and has increased the dividend amount at least once every year as in the past future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs and will be declared at the discretion of the company’s board of directors

mcdonalds corporation 2018 annual report 12 



at least annually we consider which companies comprise a readily identifiable investment peer group mcdonalds is included in published restaurant indices however unlike most other companies included in these indices which have no or limited international operations mcdonalds does business in more than 100 countries and a substantial portion of our revenues and income is generated outside the us in addition because of our size mcdonalds inclusion in those indices tends to skew the results therefore we believe that such a comparison is not meaningful 

our market capitalization trading volume and importance in an industry that is vital to the us economy have resulted in mcdonalds inclusion in the dow jones industrial average djia since 1985 like mcdonalds many djia companies generate meaningful revenues and income outside the us and some manage global brands thus we believe that the use of the djia companies as the group for comparison purposes is appropriate 

the following performance graph shows mcdonalds cumulative total shareholder returns ie price appreciation and reinvestment of dividends relative to the standard  poors 500 stock index sp 500 index and to the djia companies for the fiveyear period ended december 31 2018  the graph assumes that the value of an investment in mcdonalds common stock the sp 500 index and the djia companies including mcdonalds was 100 at december 31 2013  for the djia companies returns are weighted for market capitalization as of the beginning of each period indicated these returns may vary from those of the dow jones industrial average index which is not weighted by market capitalization and may be composed of different companies during the period under consideration

overview 

description of the business 

the company operates and franchises mcdonald’s restaurants of the 37855 restaurants in 120 countries at yearend 2018  35085 were franchised 

under mcdonald’s conventional franchise arrangement the company generally owns the land and building or secures a longterm lease for the restaurant location and the franchisee pays for equipment signs seating and décor the company believes that ownership of real estate combined with the coinvestment by franchisees enables us to achieve restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry 

franchisees are also responsible for reinvesting capital in their businesses over time in addition to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives the company frequently coinvests with franchisees to fund improvements to their restaurants or their operating systems these investments developed in collaboration with franchisees are designed to cater to consumer preferences improve local business performance and increase the value of our brand through the development of modernized more attractive and higher revenue generating restaurants 

under mcdonalds developmental license or affiliate arrangement licensees provide capital for the entire business including the real estate interest and the company generally has no capital invested the company also has an equity investment in a limited number of foreign affiliates primarily in china and japan 

mcdonalds is primarily a franchisor and believes franchising is paramount to delivering greattasting food locallyrelevant customer experiences and driving profitability franchising enables an individual to be his or her own employer and maintain control over all employmentrelated matters marketing and pricing decisions while also benefiting from the strength of mcdonalds global brand operating system and financial resources 

directly operating mcdonald’s restaurants contributes significantly to our ability to act as a credible franchisor one of the strengths of the franchising model is that the expertise from operating companyowned restaurants allows mcdonald’s to improve the operations and success of all restaurants while innovations from franchisees can be tested and when viable efficiently implemented across relevant restaurants having companyowned and operated restaurants provides company personnel with a venue for restaurant operations training experience in addition in our companyowned and operated restaurants and in collaboration with franchisees we are able to further develop and refine operating standards marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies that will ultimately benefit mcdonald’s restaurants mcdonalds continually reviews its mix of companyoperated and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance with a goal to be approximately 95 franchised over the long term 

the company’s revenues consist of sales by companyoperated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments and initial fees revenues from developmental licensees and affiliate restaurants include a royalty based on a percent of sales and generally include initial fees upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new license fees vary by type of site amount of company investment if any and local business conditions these fees along with occupancy and operating rights are stipulated in franchiselicense agreements that generally have 20year terms

the company has continually reviewed its mix of companyowned and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance with a goal to be approximately 95 franchised over the long term franchised restaurants represent approximately 93 of mcdonalds restaurants worldwide at december 31 2018 although refranchising allows the company to generate more stable and predictable revenue and cash flow streams while operating with a less resourceintensive structure the shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants negatively impacts consolidated revenues as companyoperated sales are replaced by franchised revenues where the company receives rent andor royalty revenue based on a percentage of sales

certain of the company’s debt obligations contain crossacceleration provisions and restrictions on company and subsidiary mortgages and the longterm debt of certain subsidiaries there are no provisions in the company’s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the company’s business under existing authorization from the company’s board of directors the company has 150 billion of authority to borrow funds of which 65 billion remains outstanding as of december 31 2018 these borrowings may include i public or private offering of debt securities ii direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions and iii other forms of indebtedness in addition to debt securities available through a mediumterm notes program registered with the sec and a global mediumterm notes program the company has 35 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the us and global markets see debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements in 2019 the company plans to issue longterm debt to refinance 21 billion of maturing corporate debt as of december 31 2018  the companys subsidiaries also had 254 million of borrowings outstanding primarily under uncommitted foreign currency line of credit agreements

the company’s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies the company’s largest net asset exposures defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities at year end were as follows 

foreign currency net asset exposures 



the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the company’s results of operations cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments the interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that 

mcdonalds corporation 2018 annual report 28 

each foreign currency rate would change by 10 in the same direction relative to the us dollar on all financial instruments however the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets based on the results of these analyses of the company’s financial instruments neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2018 levels nor a 10 adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2018 levels would materially affect the company’s results of operations cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments 

liquidity 

the company has significant operations outside the us where we earn about 65 of our operating income a significant portion of these historical earnings have been reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the company has made and will continue to make substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations 

the companys cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately 708 million as of december 31 2018  

consistent with prior years we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents domestic cash flows from operations repatriation of a portion of foreign earnings and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating investing and financing activities we also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating investing and financing activities 

in the future should we require more capital to fund activities in the us than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods earnings from foreign jurisdictions 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the company has longterm contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations related to both companyoperated and franchised restaurants and debt obligations in addition the company has longterm revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements cash provided by operations including cash provided by these franchise arrangements along with the company’s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations the following table summarizes the company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the company under existing franchise arrangements as of december 31 2018  see discussions of cash flows financial position and capital resources as well as the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates 

  

mcdonalds corporation 2018 annual report 29 

the company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to confirm that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

 property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straightline basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets taking into account anticipated technological or other changes the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors economic factors and industry trends if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or writeoffs in future periods 

 the company has a sharebased compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equitybased incentives including stock options and restricted stock units rsus to employees and nonemployee directors the expense for these equitybased incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period the company estimates forfeitures when determining the amount of compensation costs to be recognized in each period 

the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closedform pricing model the pricing model requires assumptions which impact the assumed fair value including the expected life of the stock option the riskfree interest rate expected volatility of the company’s stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield the company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants sharebased compensation expense will fluctuate in future years the fair value of each rsu granted is equal to the market price of the company’s stock at date of grant and prior to 2018 included a reduction for the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period for performancebased rsus granted beginning in 2016 the company includes a relative total shareholder return tsr modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period the fair value of performancebased rsus that include the tsr modifier is determined using a monte carlo valuation model 

 longlived assets including goodwill are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in assessing the recoverability of the company’s longlived assets the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the company’s experience and knowledge of its operations these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions operating costs inflation competition and consumer and demographic trends a key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales if the company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future the company may be required to record impairment charges based on the annual goodwill impairment test conducted in the fourth quarter the company does not have any reporting units defined as each individual market with risk of material goodwill impairment 

 in the ordinary course of business the company is subject to proceedings lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors customers employees franchisees government agencies intellectual property shareholders and suppliers the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses a determination of the amount of accrual required if any for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters the company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 

 the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies including the sale of appreciated assets in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if these estimates and assumptions change in the future the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance this could result in a charge to or an increase in income in the period such determination is made 

the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter the most significant new developments in 2018 and 2017 are described below 

in 2018 and 2017 the company increased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits by 162 million and 256 million respectively in both 2018 and 2017 there was audit progression in the us federal and state audits as well as multiple foreign tax jurisdictions the company has considered this new information in evaluating the unrecognized tax benefits and in certain situations the company changed its judgment on the measurement of the related unrecognized tax benefits these changes have been reflected in the unrecognized tax benefits table that is included in the income taxes footnote in the consolidated financial statements 

in 2015 the internal revenue service “irs” issued a revenue agent report “rar” that included certain disagreed transfer pricing adjustments related to the company’s us federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010 also in 2015 the company filed a protest with the irs related to these disagreed transfer pricing matters during 2017 the company received a response to its protest in december 2018 the company met with the irs appeals team and additional meetings are anticipated in 2019 the company expects resolution on these issues in 2019 or 2020 

in 2017 the irs completed its examination of the company’s us federal income tax returns for 2011 and 2012 in 2018 the irs issued a rar for these years as expected the rar included the same disagreed transfer pricing matters as the 2009 and 2010 rar also in 2018 the company filed a protest with the irs related to these disagreed transfer pricing matters the transfer pricing matters for 2011 

mcdonalds corporation 2018 annual report 30 

and 2012 are being addressed along with the 2009 and 2010 transfer pricing matters as part of the 20092010 appeals process such that resolution is expected in either 2019 or 2020 

while the company cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the aforementioned tax matters we believe that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined in accordance with topic 740  income taxes of the accounting standards codification “asc” 

in december 2015 the european commission opened a formal investigation against the luxembourg government to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries complied with european union rules on state aid in september 2018 the european commission concluded that luxembourg’s tax treatment of these mcdonald’s subsidiaries did not constitute state aid under the european union rules this decision resulted in no impact to the company’s financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2018 

the tax act was enacted in the us on december 22 2017 the tax act reduced the us federal corporate income tax rate to 21 from 35 and required companies to pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred in 2017 the company recorded provisional amounts for certain enactmentdate effects of the tax act by applying the guidance in staff accounting bulletin sab 118 because the company had not yet completed its enactmentdate accounting for these effects in 2018 the company recorded adjustments to the provisional amounts and completed its accounting for all of the enactmentdate income tax effects of the tax act 

sab 118 measurement period 

at december 31 2017 the company had not completed its accounting for all of the enactmentdate income tax effects of the tax act under asc 740 income taxes  primarily for the following aspects remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities onetime transition tax and its accounting position related to indefinite reinvestment of unremitted foreign earnings as further discussed below during 2018 the company recognized adjustments of approximately 75 million to the provisional amounts recorded at december 31 2017 primarily related to the transition tax these adjustments are included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations 

onetime transition tax the onetime transition tax is based on the companys total post1986 earnings and profits ep the tax on which it previously deferred from us income taxes under us law the company recorded a provisional amount for its onetime transition tax liability for each of its foreign subsidiaries resulting in a transition tax liability of approximately 12 billion at december 31 2017 

upon further analyses of the tax act and notices and regulations issued and proposed by the irs and the us department of the treasury the company finalized its calculations of the transition tax liability during 2018 and increased its december 31 2017 provisional amount by approximately 75 million the company has elected to pay its transition tax over the eightyear period provided in the tax act 

deferred tax assets and liabilities as of december 31 2017 the company remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they were expected to reverse in the future generally 21 by recording a provisional amount of approximately 500 million no adjustment to the provisional amount was made in 2018 

effects of changing prices—inflation 

the company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively this ability is because of rapid inventory turnover the ability to adjust menu prices cost controls and substantial property holdings many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation

c narrative description of business 

 the company operates and franchises mcdonald’s restaurants which serve a locallyrelevant menu of quality food and beverages sold at various price points in more than 100 countries mcdonald’s global system is comprised of both companyowned and franchised restaurants mcdonald’s franchised restaurants are owned and operated under one of the following structures  conventional franchise developmental license or affiliate the optimal ownership structure for an individual restaurant trading area or market country is based on a variety of factors including the availability of individuals with the entrepreneurial experience and financial resources as well as the local legal and regulatory environment in critical areas such as property ownership and franchising we continually review our mix of companyowned and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance with a goal to be approximately 95 franchised over the long term the business relationship between mcdonald’s and its independent franchisees is of fundamental importance to overall performance and to the mcdonald’s brand this business relationship is supported by an agreement that requires adherence to standards and policies essential to protecting our brand 

the company is primarily a franchisor with more than 90 of mcdonalds restaurants currently owned and operated by independent franchisees franchising enables an individual to be their own employer and maintain control over all employment related matters marketing and pricing decisions while also benefiting from the strength of mcdonald’s global brand operating system and financial resources one of the strengths of this model is that the expertise gained from operating companyowned restaurants allows mcdonald’s to improve the operations and success of all restaurants while innovations from franchisees can be tested and when viable efficiently implemented across relevant restaurants 

directly operating mcdonald’s restaurants contributes significantly to our ability to act as a credible franchisor having companyowned restaurants provides company personnel with a venue for restaurant operations training experience in addition in our companyowned and operated restaurants and in collaboration with franchisees we are able to further develop and refine operating standards marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies that will ultimately benefit mcdonald’s restaurants 

 

under a conventional franchise arrangement the company generally owns the land and building or secures a longterm lease for the restaurant location and the franchisee pays for equipment signs seating and décor the company believes that ownership of real estate combined with the coinvestment by franchisees enables us to achieve restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry 

franchisees are also responsible for reinvesting capital in their businesses over time in addition to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives the company frequently coinvests with franchisees to fund improvements to their restaurants or their operating systems these investments developed with input from mcdonald’s with the aim of improving local business performance increase the value of our brand through the development of modernized more attractive and higher revenue generating restaurants

 mcdonald’s restaurants compete with international national regional and local retailers of food products the company competes on the basis of price convenience service menu variety and product quality in a highly fragmented global restaurant industry 

in measuring the company’s competitive position management reviews data compiled by euromonitor international a leading source of market data with respect to the global restaurant industry the company’s primary competition which is referred to as the informal eating out ieo segment includes the following restaurant categories defined by euromonitor international quickservice eating establishments casual dining fullservice restaurants street stalls or kiosks cafés100 home deliverytakeaway providers specialist coffee shops selfservice cafeterias and juicesmoothie bars the ieo segment excludes establishments that primarily serve alcohol and fullservice restaurants other than casual dining 

based on data from euromonitor international the global ieo segment was composed of approximately 9 million outlets and generated 12 trillion in annual sales in 2016  the most recent year for which data is available mcdonald’s systemwide 2016 restaurant business accounted for 04 of those outlets and 70 of the sales 

management also on occasion benchmarks mcdonald’s against the entire restaurant industry including the ieo segment defined above and all other fullservice restaurants based on data from euromonitor international the restaurant industry was composed of approximately 19 million outlets and generated 24 trillion in annual sales in 2016  mcdonald’s systemwide restaurant business accounted for 02 of those outlets and 35 of the sales

 the company continuously endeavors to improve its social responsibility and environmental practices to achieve longterm sustainability which benefits mcdonald’s and the communities it serves 

increased focus by certain governmental authorities on environmental matters may lead to new governmental initiatives while we cannot predict the precise nature of these initiatives we expect that they may impact our business both directly and indirectly although the impact would likely vary by world region andor market we believe that adoption of new regulations may increase costs for the company also there is a possibility that governmental initiatives or actual or perceived effects of changes in weather patterns climate or water resources could have a direct impact on the operations of the system in ways which we cannot predict at this time 

the company monitors developments related to environmental matters and plans to respond to governmental initiatives in a timely and appropriate manner at this time the company has already begun to undertake its own initiatives relating to preservation of the environment including the implementation of more energy efficient equipment and management of energy use and more sustainable sourcing practices in many of its markets

tableend

  

the information in this report includes forwardlooking statements about future events and circumstances and their effects upon revenues expenses and business opportunities generally speaking any statement in this report not based upon historical fact is a forwardlooking statement forwardlooking statements can also be identified by the use of forwardlooking words such as “may” “will” “expect” “believe” “anticipate” and “plan” or similar expressions in particular statements regarding our plans strategies prospects and expectations regarding our business and industry including those under outlook are forwardlooking statements they reflect our expectations are 

 

not guarantees of performance and speak only as of the date of this report except as required by law we do not undertake to update them our expectations or the underlying assumptions may change or not be realized and you should not rely unduly on forwardlooking statements our business results are subject to a variety of risks including those that are reflected in the following considerations and factors as well as elsewhere in our filings with the sec if any of these considerations or risks materialize our expectations may change and our performance may be adversely affected 

if we do not successfully evolve and execute against our business strategies we may not be able to increase operating income 

to drive future results our business strategies must be effective in delivering increased guest counts to drive operating income growth whether these strategies are successful depends mainly on our system’s ability to 

 if we are delayed or unsuccessful in executing our strategies or if our strategies do not yield the desired results our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

our investments to enhance the customer experience including through technology may not generate the expected returns 

we will continue to build upon our investments in eotf which focus on restaurant modernization and technology and digital engagement in order to transform the restaurant experience as we accelerate our pace of converting restaurants to eotf we are placing renewed emphasis on improving our service model and strengthening relationships with customers in part through digital channels and loyalty initiatives as well as mobile ordering and payment systems we also continue to build on delivery initiatives which may not generate expected returns we may not fully realize the intended benefits of these significant investments or these initiatives may not be well executed and therefore our business results may suffer 

if we do not anticipate and address evolving consumer preferences our business could suffer 

our continued success depends on our system’s ability to anticipate and respond effectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics and trends in food sourcing food preparation food offerings and consumer preferences in the “informal eating out” ieo segment in order to deliver a relevant experience for our customers amidst a highly competitive valuedriven operating environment we must implement initiatives to adapt at an aggressive pace there is no assurance 

  

mcdonalds corporation 2017 annual report 3 

that these initiatives will be successful and if they are not our financial results could be adversely impacted 

activities relating to our refranchising and cost savings initiatives remain ongoing and entail various risks 

our previously announced refranchising and cost saving initiatives remain ongoing as we continue on those initiatives the existing risks we face in our business may be intensified our efforts to reduce costs and capital expenditures depend in part upon our refranchising efforts which in turn depend upon our selection and integration of capable third parties our cost savings initiatives also depend upon a variety of factors including our ability to achieve efficiencies through the consolidation of global backoffice functions if these various initiatives are not successful take longer to complete than initially projected or are not well executed or if our cost reduction efforts adversely impact our effectiveness our business operations financial results and results of operations could be adversely affected 

if pricing promotional and marketing plans are not effective our results may be negatively impacted 

our results depend on the impact of pricing promotional and marketing plans across the system and the ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly and effectively to evolving customer preferences as well as shifting economic and competitive conditions existing or future pricing strategies and the value proposition they represent are expected to continue to be important components of our business strategy however they may not be successful and could negatively impact sales and margins further the promotion of menu offerings may yield results below the desired levels 

additionally we operate in a complex and costly advertising environment our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful and we may fail to attract and retain customers our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising and marketing resources across different channels allows us to reach our customers effectively if the advertising and marketing programs are not successful or are not as successful as those of our competitors our sales guest counts and market share could decrease 

failure to preserve the value and relevance of our brand could have an adverse impact on our financial results 

to be successful in the future we believe we must preserve enhance and leverage the value of our brand brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions those perceptions are affected by a variety of factors including the nutritional content and preparation of our food the ingredients we use our business practices and the manner in which we source the commodities we use consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons and some changes can occur rapidly for example nutritional health and other scientific studies and conclusions which constantly evolve and may have contradictory implications drive popular opinion litigation and regulation including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior in ways that affect the ieo segment or perceptions of our brand generally or relative to available alternatives consumer perceptions may also be affected by third parties presenting or promoting adverse commentary or portrayals of the quickservice category of the ieo segment our brand andor our operations our suppliers or our franchisees if we are unsuccessful in addressing such adverse commentary or portrayals our brand and our financial results may suffer 

additionally the ongoing relevance of our brand may depend on the success of our sustainability initiatives which require systemwide coordination and alignment if we are not 

 

effective in addressing social responsibility matters or achieving relevant sustainability goals consumer trust in our brand may suffer in particular business incidents or practices that erode consumer trust or confidence particularly if such incidents or practices receive considerable publicity or result in litigation can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results 

we face intense competition in our markets which could hurt our business 

we compete primarily in the ieo segment which is highly competitive we also face sustained intense competition from traditional fast casual and other competitors which may include many nontraditional market participants such as convenience stores grocery stores and coffee shops we expect our environment to continue to be highly competitive and our results in any particular reporting period may be impacted by new or continuing actions of our competitors which may have a short or longterm impact on our results 

we compete on the basis of product choice quality affordability service and location in particular we believe our ability to compete successfully in the current market environment depends on our ability to improve existing products develop new products price our products appropriately deliver a relevant customer experience manage the complexity of our restaurant operations and respond effectively to our competitors’ actions or disruptive actions from others which we do not foresee recognizing these dependencies we have intensified our focus in recent periods on strategies to achieve these goals and we will likely continue to modify our strategies and implement new strategies in the future there can be no assurance these strategies will be effective and some strategies may be effective at improving some metrics while adversely affecting other metrics 

unfavorable general economic conditions could adversely affect our business and financial results 

our results of operations are substantially affected by economic conditions which can vary significantly by market and can impact consumer disposable income levels and spending habits economic conditions can also be impacted by a variety of factors including hostilities epidemics and actions taken by governments to manage national and international economic matters whether through austerity stimulus measures or trade measures and initiatives intended to control wages unemployment credit availability inflation taxation and other economic drivers continued adverse economic conditions or adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets could pressure our operating performance and our business and financial results may suffer 

our results of operations are also affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may adversely affect reported earnings 

supply chain interruptions may increase costs or reduce revenues 

we depend on the effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure reliable and sufficient product supply including on favorable terms although many of the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers in countries around the world certain products have limited suppliers which may increase our reliance on those suppliers supply chain interruptions including shortages and transportation issues and price increases can adversely affect us as well as our suppliers and franchisees whose performance may have a significant impact on our results such shortages or disruptions could be caused by factors beyond the control of our suppliers 

4 mcdonalds corporation 2017 annual report 

franchisees or us if we experience interruptions in our system’s supply chain our costs could increase and it could limit the availability of products critical to our system’s operations 

food safety concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

our ability to increase sales and profits depends on our system’s ability to meet expectations for safe food and on our ability to manage the potential impact on mcdonald’s of foodborne illnesses and food or product safety issues that may arise in the future food safety is a top priority and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe food products including as our menu and service model evolve however food safety events including instances of foodborne illness have occurred in the food industry in the past and could occur in the future instances of food tampering food contamination or foodborne illness whether actual or perceived could adversely affect our brand and reputation as well as our revenues and profits 

our franchise business model presents a number of risks 

our success increasingly relies on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees including our developmental licensees and affiliates yet we have limited influence over their operations our restaurant margins arise from two sources fees from franchised restaurants eg rent and royalties based on a percentage of sales and to a lesser degree sales from companyoperated restaurants our franchisees manage their businesses independently and therefore are responsible for the daytoday operation of their restaurants the revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales if our franchisees do not experience sales growth our revenues and margins could be negatively affected as a result also if sales trends worsen for franchisees their financial results may deteriorate which could result in among other things restaurant closures or delayed or reduced payments to us our refranchising efforts will continue to increase that dependence and the potential effect of those factors 

our success also increasingly depends on the willingness and ability of our independent franchisees and affiliates to implement major initiatives which may include financial investment and to remain aligned with us on operating promotional and capitalintensive reinvestment plans franchisees’ ability to contribute to the achievement of our plans is dependent in large part on the availability to them of funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general or by the creditworthiness of our franchisees or the company our operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety or other operational problems or project an image inconsistent with our brand and values particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited costly to exercise or subjected to litigation and potential delays if franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards our brand’s image and reputation could be harmed which in turn could hurt our business and operating results 

our ownership mix also affects our results and financial condition the decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex and changing our ability to achieve the benefits of our refranchising strategy which involves a significant percentage of franchised restaurants including an increased number of restaurants run by developmental licensees and affiliates depends on various factors those factors include whether we have effectively selected 

 

franchisees licensees andor affiliates that meet our rigorous standards and whether their performance and the resulting ownership mix supports our brand and financial objectives 

challenges with respect to talent management could harm our business 

effective succession planning is important to our longterm success failure to effectively identify develop and retain key personnel recruit highquality candidates and ensure smooth management and personnel transitions could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results 

our success depends in part on our system’s ability to recruit motivate and retain a qualified workforce to work in our restaurants in an intensely competitive environment increased costs associated with recruiting motivating and retaining qualified employees to work in our companyoperated restaurants could have a negative impact on our companyoperated margins similar concerns apply to our franchisees 

we are also impacted by the costs and other effects of compliance with us and international regulations affecting our workforce which includes our staff and employees working in our companyoperated restaurants these regulations are increasingly focused on employment issues including wage and hour healthcare immigration retirement and other employee benefits and workplace practices our potential exposure to reputational and other harm regarding our workplace practices or conditions or those of our independent franchisees or suppliers or perceptions thereof could have a negative impact on consumer perceptions of us and our business additionally economic action such as boycotts protests work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations could adversely affect us including our ability to recruit and retain talent or the franchisees and suppliers that are also part of the mcdonalds system and whose performance may have a material impact on our results 

information technology system failures or interruptions or breaches of network security may interrupt our operations 

we are increasingly reliant on technological systems such as pointofsale and other instore systems or platforms technologies supporting mcdonald’s delivery and digital solutions as well as technologies that facilitate communication and collaboration internally with affiliated entities customers or independent third parties to conduct our business including technologyenabled systems provided to us by third parties any failure of these systems could significantly impact our operations and customer experience and perceptions 

despite the implementation of security measures those technology systems and solutions could become vulnerable to damage disability or failures due to theft fire power loss telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events our increasing reliance on third party systems also present the risks faced by the third party’s business including the operational security and credit risks of those parties if those systems were to fail or otherwise be unavailable and we were unable to recover in a timely way we could experience an interruption in our operations 

furthermore security breaches have from time to time occurred and may in the future occur involving our systems the systems of the parties we communicate or collaborate with including franchisees or those of third party providers these may include such things as unauthorized access denial of service computer viruses introduction of malware or ransomware and other disruptive problems caused by hackers our information technology systems contain personal financial and other information that is entrusted to us by our customers 

  

mcdonalds corporation 2017 annual report 5 

our employees and other third parties as well as financial proprietary and other confidential information related to our business an actual or alleged security breach could result in disruptions shutdowns theft or unauthorized disclosure of personal financial proprietary or other confidential information the occurrence of any of these incidents could result in reputational damage adverse publicity loss of consumer confidence reduced sales and profits complications in executing our growth initiatives and criminal penalties or civil liabilities 

the global scope of our business subjects us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

we encounter differing cultural regulatory and economic environments within and among the more than 100 countries where mcdonald’s restaurants operate and our ability to achieve our business objectives depends on the systems success in these environments meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment and our global success is partially dependent on our system’s ability to leverage operating successes across markets planned initiatives may not have appeal across multiple markets with mcdonalds customers and could drive unanticipated changes in customer perceptions and guest counts 

disruptions in operations or price volatility in a market can also result from governmental actions such as price foreign exchange or changes in traderelated tariffs or controls governmentmandated closure of our our franchisees or our suppliers’ operations and asset seizures the cost and disruption of responding to governmental investigations or inquiries whether or not they have merit may impact our results and could cause reputational or other harm our international success depends in part on the effectiveness of our strategies and brandbuilding initiatives to reduce our exposure to such governmental investigations or inquiries 

additionally challenges and uncertainties are associated with operating in developing markets which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability economic volatility crime corruption and social and ethnic unrest such challenges may be exacerbated in many cases by a lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainties in how local law is applied and enforced including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment an inability to manage effectively the risks associated with our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

we may also face challenges and uncertainties in developed markets for example as a result of the uks decision to leave the european union through a negotiated exit over a period of time including its recent formal commencement of exit proceedings it is possible that there will be increased regulatory complexities as well as potential referenda in the uk andor other european countries that could cause uncertainty in european or worldwide economic conditions in the short term the decision created volatility in certain foreign currency exchange rates and the resulting depression in those exchange rates may continue any of these effects and others we cannot anticipate could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the us and foreign jurisdictions and our operations plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives around the world in 

 

particular we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or policy or related authoritative interpretations including changes and uncertainties resulting from proposals for comprehensive or corporate tax reforms in the us or elsewhere on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act “tax act” was signed into law while we have estimated the effects of the tax act we continue to refine those estimates with the possibility they could change and those changes could be material we are also impacted by settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by taxing authorities inside and outside of the us in connection with our tax audits all of which will depend on their timing nature and scope any increases in income tax rates changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

changes in commodity and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

the profitability of our companyoperated restaurants depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs including food paper supplies fuel utilities and distribution and other operating costs including labor any volatility in certain commodity prices or fluctuation in labor costs could adversely affect our operating results by impacting restaurant profitability the commodity markets for some of the ingredients we use such as beef and chicken are particularly volatile due to factors such as seasonal shifts climate conditions industry demand international commodity markets food safety concerns product recalls and government regulation all of which are beyond our control and in many instances unpredictable we can only partially address future price risk through hedging and other activities and therefore increases in commodity costs could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

increasing regulatory complexity may adversely affect restaurant operations and our financial results 

our regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance and similar risks that could affect our operations and results in material ways in many of our markets we are subject to increasing regulation which has increased our cost of doing business we are affected by the cost compliance and other risks associated with the often conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations we face including where inconsistent standards imposed by multiple governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings 

our success depends in part on our ability to manage the impact of new potential or changing regulations that can affect our business plans and operations these regulations include product packaging marketing the nutritional content and safety of our food and other products labeling and other disclosure practices compliance efforts with those regulations may be affected by ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from thirdparty suppliers particularly given varying requirements and practices for testing and disclosure 

additionally we are working to manage the risks and costs to us our franchisees and our supply chain of the effects of climate change greenhouse gases and diminishing energy and water resources these risks include the increased public focus including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations on these and other environmental sustainability matters such as packaging and waste animal health and welfare deforestation and land use these risks also include the increased pressure to make commitments set targets or 

6 mcdonalds corporation 2017 annual report 

establish additional goals and take actions to meet them these risks could expose us to market operational and execution costs or risks if we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with our complex regulatory environment it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

we are subject to increasing legal complexity and could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us 

increasing legal complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways we could be subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business including class actions administrative proceedings government investigations employment and personal injury claims landlordtenant disputes disputes with current or former suppliers claims by current or former franchisees and intellectual property claims including claims that we infringed another party’s trademarks copyrights or patents 

inconsistent standards imposed by governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to regulatory proceedings or litigation 

litigation involving our relationship with franchisees and the legal distinction between our franchisees and us for employment law purposes if determined adversely could increase costs negatively impact the business prospects of our franchisees and subject us to incremental liability for their actions similarly although our commercial relationships with our suppliers remain independent there may be attempts to challenge that independence which if determined adversely could also increase costs negatively impact the business prospects of our suppliers and subject us to incremental liability for their actions we are also subject to legal and compliance risks and associated liability such as in the areas of privacy and data collection protection and management as it relates to information we collect and share when we provide optional technologyrelated services and platforms to third parties 

our operating results could also be affected by the following 

 a judgment significantly in excess of any applicable insurance coverage or third party indemnity could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations further adverse publicity resulting from these claims may hurt our business 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately ensure that we are not infringing the intellectual property of others which could harm the value of the mcdonald’s brand and our business 

the success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets we rely on 

 

a combination of trademarks copyrights service marks trade secrets patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products 

we have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions the trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the us in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the us and foreign countries may not be adequate in addition the steps we have taken may not adequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future in particular we may be involved in intellectual property claims including often aggressive or opportunistic attempts to enforce patents used in information technology systems which might affect our operations and results any claim of infringement whether or not it has merit could be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and harm our business 

we cannot ensure that franchisees and other third parties who hold licenses to our intellectual property will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property 

changes in accounting standards or the recognition of impairment or other charges may adversely affect our future operations and results 

new accounting standards or changes in financial reporting requirements accounting principles or practices including with respect to our critical accounting estimates could adversely affect our future results we may also be affected by the nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets including decisions that result in impairment or other charges that reduce our earnings in assessing the recoverability of our longlived assets we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors these estimates are highly subjective and can be significantly impacted by many factors such as global and local business and economic conditions operating costs inflation competition consumer and demographic trends and our restructuring activities if our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges if we experience any such changes they could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results for the affected periods 

a decrease in our credit ratings or an increase in our funding costs could adversely affect our profitability 

our credit ratings may be negatively affected by our results of operations or changes in our debt levels as a result our interest expense the availability of acceptable counterparties our ability to obtain funding on favorable terms collateral requirements and our operating or financial flexibility could all be negatively affected especially if lenders impose new operating or financial covenants 

our operations may also be impacted by regulations affecting capital flows financial markets or financial institutions which can limit our ability to manage and deploy our liquidity or increase our funding costs if any of these events were to occur they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

  

mcdonalds corporation 2017 annual report 7 

trading volatility and price of our common stock may be adversely affected by many factors 

many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects the most important of these factors some of which are outside our control are the following 

 events such as severe weather conditions natural disasters hostilities and social unrest among others can adversely affect our results and prospects 

severe weather conditions natural disasters hostilities and social unrest terrorist activities health epidemics or pandemics or expectations about them can adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels and supply availability and costs as well as the local operations in impacted markets all of which can affect our results and prospects our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to some of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to cover our losses fully

at least annually we consider which companies comprise a readily identifiable investment peer group mcdonalds is included in published restaurant indices however unlike most other companies included in these indices which have no or limited international operations mcdonalds does business in more than 100 countries and a substantial portion of our revenues and income is generated outside the us in addition because of our size mcdonalds inclusion in those indices tends to skew the results therefore we believe that such a comparison is not meaningful 

our market capitalization trading volume and importance in an industry that is vital to the us economy have resulted in mcdonalds inclusion in the dow jones industrial average djia since 1985 like mcdonalds many djia companies generate meaningful revenues and income outside the us and some manage global brands thus we believe that the use of the djia companies as the group for comparison purposes is appropriate 

the following performance graph shows mcdonalds cumulative total shareholder returns ie price appreciation and reinvestment of dividends relative to the standard  poors 500 stock index sp 500 index and to the djia companies for the fiveyear period ended december 31 2017  the graph assumes that the value of an investment in mcdonalds common stock the sp 500 index and the djia companies including mcdonalds was 100 at december 31 2012  for the djia companies returns are weighted for market capitalization as of the beginning of each period indicated these returns may vary from those of the dow jones industrial average index which is not weighted by market capitalization and may be composed of different companies during the period under consideration

the company’s revenues consist of sales by companyoperated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments and initial fees revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales and generally include initial fees fees vary by type of site amount of company investment if any and local business conditions these fees along with occupancy and operating rights are stipulated in franchiselicense agreements that generally have 20year terms

 strategic direction and financial performance 

the strength of the alignment among the company its franchisees and suppliers collectively referred to as the system is key to mcdonalds longterm success by leveraging the system mcdonald’s is able to identify implement and scale ideas that meet customers changing needs and preferences mcdonalds continually builds on its competitive advantages of system alignment and geographic diversification to deliver consistent yet locallyrelevant restaurant experiences to customers as an integral part of their communities 

customercentric growth strategy 

beginning in 2015 the company made purposeful changes to execute against key elements of its turnaround plan including a renewed focus on running better restaurants driving operational growth returning excitement to the brand and enhancing financial value the company’s current momentum is broadbased throughout the system and its recent performance demonstrates that mcdonald’s has completed the transition from turnaround to growth 

in 2017 the company shifted its focus to delivering longterm growth through accelerated execution of its customercentric strategy  the velocity growth plan this plan outlines actions to drive sustainable guest count growth a reliable longterm measure of the companys strength that is vital to growing sales and shareholder value 

the velocity growth plan is rooted in extensive customer research and insights along with a deep understanding of the key drivers of the business the company is targeting the tremendous opportunity at the core of its business  its food value and customer experience the strategy is built on the following three pillars all focusing on building a better mcdonald’s 

 

 

 

in each pillar mcdonald’s has established sustainable platforms that enable execution of the plan with greater speed efficiency and impact while remaining relentlessly focused on the fundamentals of running great restaurants additionally through three identified growth accelerators  experience of the future “eotf” digital and delivery  mcdonald’s is enhancing the overall customer experience with hospitable friendly service and 

 

everimproving convenience for customers on their terms the company met aggressive deployment targets for each one of these accelerators in 2017 and continues further implementation in 2018 and beyond 

 

 

   

in 2018 mcdonald’s has plans to raise consumer awareness of the enhanced convenience available with delivery and mobile order and pay through thoughtful marketing campaigns that aim to increase the number of customers enjoying these expanded options to engage with the brand the company is optimistic that this will contribute to the continued momentum of the business 

in addition to the customerrelevant changes in the restaurants the company has enhanced financial value through its refranchising efforts ga cost savings initiatives and cash return to shareholders in 2017 the company achieved its target to refranchise 4000 restaurants a full year ahead of the original target date mcdonald’s is currently 92 franchised with a longterm goal of approximately 95 the transition to a more heavily franchised business model is benefiting the company’s performance as the rent and royalty income received from franchisees provides a more predictable and stable revenue stream with significantly lower operating costs and risks this includes a less ga and capital intensive structure as franchisees are responsible for supporting and reinvesting in their businesses under this more heavily franchised structure growing comparable sales will be the strongest driver of operating income growth and returns

the company’s revenues consist of sales by companyoperated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales minimum rent payments and initial fees revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales and generally include initial fees 

between 2015 and 2017 the company accelerated the pace of refranchising to optimize its restaurant ownership mix generate more stable and predictable revenue and cash flow streams and operate with a less resourceintensive structure the shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants negatively impacts consolidated revenues as companyoperated sales are replaced by franchised sales where the company receives rent andor royalty revenue based on a percentage of sales

 unlike comparable sales the company has not excluded hyperinflationary market results from systemwide sales as these sales are the basis on which the company calculates and records revenues the difference between comparable sales growth rates and systemwide sales growth rates are due to both restaurant expansion and the hyperinflationary impact

selling general  administrative expenses 

consolidated selling general and administrative expenses decreased 6  7 in constant currencies in 2017 and decreased 2 1 in constant currencies in 2016  the decrease in 2017 was due to lower employeerelated costs partly offset by higher restaurant technology spending the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to lower employeerelated costs mostly offset by higher incentivebased compensation expenses 

selling general  administrative expenses 



 selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales was 25 in 2017  28 in 2016 and 29 in 2015  management believes that analyzing selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support the overall mcdonalds business 

in connection with our turnaround plan the company established a net selling general and administrative savings target of 500 million from its ga base of 26 billion at the beginning of 2015 the company expects to fully realize its targeted 500 million of net savings in 2019

more than 90 of the restaurants at yearend 2017 were franchised including 94 in the us 87 in international lead markets 81 in high growth markets and 98 in foundational markets 

capital expenditures were relatively flat in 2017 as higher expenditures on restaurant reinvestment were offset by fewer restaurant openings that required the companys capital under mcdonalds developmental licensee and affiliate arrangements licensees provide capital for the entire business and the company generally has no capital invested capital expenditures in 2016 were essentially flat with 2015 primarily due to higher 

 

reinvestment related to reimages offset by fewer new restaurant openings

debt highlights 1   



 

standard  poor’s and moody’s currently rate with a stable outlook the company’s commercial paper a2 and p2 respectively and its longterm debt bbb and baa1 respectively to access the debt capital markets the company relies on creditrating agencies to assign shortterm and longterm credit ratings 

certain of the company’s debt obligations contain crossacceleration provisions and restrictions on company and subsidiary mortgages and the longterm debt of certain subsidiaries there are no provisions in the company’s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the company’s business under existing authorization from the company’s board of directors at december 31 2017  the company had 150 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds including through i public or private offering of debt securities ii direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions and iii other forms of indebtedness in addition to debt securities available through a mediumterm notes program registered with the us securities and exchange commission sec and a global mediumterm notes program the company has 25 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the us and global markets see debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements debt maturing in 2018 is 18 billion of longterm corporate debt the company plans to issue longterm debt to refinance this maturing debt as of december 31 2017  the companys subsidiaries also had 268 million of borrowings outstanding primarily under uncommitted foreign currency line of credit agreements 

the company uses major capital markets bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense the company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring redeeming and repurchasing debt terminating swaps and using derivatives the company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes all swaps are overthecounter instruments 

26 mcdonalds corporation 2017 annual report 

in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations the company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated the company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties intercompany financings and longterm investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates this reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders’ equity total foreign currencydenominated debt was 124 billion and 89 billion for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively in addition where practical the company’s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges see the summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives 

the company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below or aggregate exposures exceed certain contractual limits at december 31 2017  the company was required to post an immaterial amount of collateral due to negative fair value of certain derivative positions the companys counterparties were not required to post collateral on any derivative position other than on hedges of certain of the company’s supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions 

the company’s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies the company’s largest net asset exposures defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities at year end were as follows 

foreign currency net asset exposures 



the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the company’s results of operations cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments the interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10 in the same direction relative to the us dollar on all financial instruments however the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets based on the results of these analyses of the company’s financial instruments neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2017 levels nor a 10 adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2017 levels would materially affect the company’s results of operations cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments 

liquidity 

the company has significant operations outside the us where we earn about 60 of our operating income a significant portion 

 

of these historical earnings have been reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the company has made and will continue to make substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations 

the companys cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately 15 billion as of december 31 2017  

consistent with prior years we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents domestic cash flows from operations annual repatriation of a portion of the current periods foreign earnings and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating investing and financing activities we also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating investing and financing activities 

as a result of the tax act the company expects an incremental cash flow benefit of 400 to 500 million annually due to a reduction of the us corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 partly offset by a 12 billion 2017 tax cost on deemed repatriation of foreign earnings that will be paid over the next 8 years 

in the future should we require more capital to fund activities in the us than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods earnings from foreign jurisdictions 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the company has longterm contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations related to both companyoperated and franchised restaurants and debt obligations in addition the company has longterm revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements cash provided by operations including cash provided by these franchise arrangements along with the company’s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations the following table summarizes the company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the company under existing franchise arrangements as of december 31 2017  see discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

 in the us the company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to i make taxdeferred contributions and ii receive companyprovided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of internal revenue service irs limitations at december 31 2017  total liabilities for the supplemental plans were 484 million  

at december 31 2017 total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were 12 billion  in addition a liability of approximately 12 billion was recorded in 2017 resulting from the 

  

mcdonalds corporation 2017 annual report 27 

tax act which imposed a deemed repatriation tax on the companys undistributed foreign earnings this tax liability will be paid over eight years beginning in 2018 

there are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction inventory energy marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business such commitments are generally shorter term in nature will be funded from operating cash flows and are not significant to the company’s overall financial position 



critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates 

the company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

 property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straightline basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets taking into account anticipated technological or other changes the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors economic factors and industry trends if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or writeoffs in future periods 

 assets and liabilities of businesses held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2016 primarily consisted of balances related to businesses in china and hong kong in december 2016 the company’s board of directors approved an agreement for the company to sell its existing businesses in china and hong kong to a licensee based on this approval the company concluded that these markets were “held for sale” as of december 31 2016 in accordance with the requirements of asc 360 “property plant and equipment” the company completed the sale of these businesses on july 31 2017 

 the company has a sharebased compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equitybased incentives including stock options and restricted stock units rsus to employees and nonemployee directors the expense for these equitybased incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant 

 

and generally amortized over their vesting period the company estimates forfeitures when determining the amount of compensation costs to be recognized in each period 

the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closedform pricing model the pricing model requires assumptions which impact the assumed fair value including the expected life of the stock option the riskfree interest rate expected volatility of the company’s stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield the company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants sharebased compensation expense will fluctuate in future years the fair value of each rsu granted is equal to the market price of the company’s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period for performancebased rsus granted beginning in 2016 the company includes a relative total shareholder return tsr modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period the fair value of performancebased rsus that include the tsr modifier is determined using a monte carlo valuation model 

 longlived assets including goodwill are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in assessing the recoverability of the company’s longlived assets the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the company’s experience and knowledge of its operations these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions operating costs inflation competition and consumer and demographic trends a key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales if the company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future the company may be required to record impairment charges based on the annual goodwill impairment test conducted in the fourth quarter approximately 510 of goodwill may be at risk of future impairment as the fair values of certain reporting units were not substantially in excess of their carrying amounts 

 in the ordinary course of business the company is subject to proceedings lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors customers employees franchisees government agencies intellectual property shareholders and suppliers the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses a determination of the amount of accrual required if any for these contingencies is made after 

careful analysis of each matter the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters the company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 

 the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies including the sale of appreciated assets in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if these estimates and assumptions change in the future the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance this could result in a 

28 mcdonalds corporation 2017 annual report 

charge to or an increase in income in the period such determination is made 

the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter the most significant new developments in 2017 and 2016 are described below 

in 2017 and 2016 the company increased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken in prior years by 144 million and 150 million respectively these increases primarily resulted from the evaluation of new information during the progression of tax audits in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions as a result of this new information the company changed its judgment on the measurement of the related unrecognized tax benefits and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits see the income taxes footnote in the consolidated financial statements for the related tax reconciliations 

in 2015 the internal revenue service “irs” issued a revenue agent report “rar” that included certain disagreed transfer pricing adjustments related to the company’s us federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010 also in 2015 the company filed a protest with the irs appeals office related to these disagreed transfer pricing matters during 2017 the company received a response to its protest and as of december 31 2017 is awaiting scheduling of an opening conference with irs appeals the company expects resolution on these issues in either 2018 or 2019 

in 2017 the irs completed its examination of the company’s us federal income tax returns for 2011 and 2012 although at december 31 2017 the irs had not yet issued its rar for these years when issued it is expected to result in the same disagreed transfer pricing matters as the 2009 and 2010 rar consequently it is expected that the transfer pricing matters for 2011 and 2012 will be addressed along with the 2009 and 2010 matters as part of the 20092010 appeal such that resolution is expected in either 2018 or 2019 

in december 2015 the european commission opened a formal investigation directly with the luxembourg government to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with european union rules on state aid if this matter is adversely resolved luxembourg may be required to assess and the company may be required to pay additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase as of december 31 2017 no decision has been published with respect to this investigation 

while the company cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the aforementioned tax matters we believe that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined in accordance with topic 740  income taxes of the accounting standards codification “asc” 

the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 “tax act” was enacted on december 22 2017 the tax act reduces the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 requires companies to pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings at december 31 2017 the company has not completed the accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the tax act however as described below the company has made a reasonable estimate of the effects on the existing deferred tax balances and the onetime transition tax for these items a provisional net tax cost of approximately 700 million is recognized and is included as a component of provision for income taxes from continuing operations 

 

provisional amounts 

deferred tax assets and liabilities the company remeasured certain us deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future which is generally 21 however the company is still analyzing certain aspects of the tax act and refining the calculations which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts a provisional amount was recorded related to the remeasurement of the deferred tax balance resulting in a provision for income taxes benefit of approximately 500 million 

foreign tax effects the onetime transition tax is based on the total post1986 earnings and profits ep that the company had previously deferred from us income taxes a provisional amount was recorded for the onetime transition tax liability resulting in a provision for income taxes cost of approximately 12 billion the company has not yet completed the calculation of the total post1986 foreign ep further the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets this amount may change when the calculation of post1986 foreign ep and the amounts held in cash or other specified assets are finalized additionally the provisional amount includes an estimate of foreign withholding taxes related to the ep subject to the transition tax a provisional deferred tax liability has been recorded for temporary differences related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures however the company is still evaluating how the tax act will affect the company’s accounting position related to the indefinite reinvestment of unremitted foreign earnings during the measurement period the company may reflect adjustments to this provisional amount upon obtaining preparing and analyzing the necessary information to complete the accounting under asc 740 

effects of changing prices—inflation 

the company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively this ability is because of rapid inventory turnover the ability to adjust menu prices cost controls and substantial property holdings many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation

c narrative description of business 

 the company operates and franchises mcdonald’s restaurants which serve a locallyrelevant menu of quality food and beverages sold at various price points in more than 100 countries mcdonald’s global system is comprised of both companyowned and franchised restaurants mcdonald’s franchised restaurants are owned and operated under one of the following structures  conventional franchise developmental license or affiliate the optimal ownership structure for an individual restaurant trading area or market country is based on a variety of factors including the availability of individuals with the entrepreneurial experience and financial resources as well as the local legal and regulatory environment in critical areas such as property ownership and franchising we continually review our mix of companyowned and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance with a goal to be approximately 95 franchised over the long term the business relationship between mcdonald’s and its independent franchisees is of fundamental importance to overall performance and to the mcdonald’s brand this business relationship is supported by an agreement that requires adherence to standards and policies essential to protecting our brand 

the company is primarily a franchisor with approximately 85 of mcdonalds restaurants currently owned and operated by independent franchisees franchising enables an individual to be their own employer and maintain control over all employment related matters marketing and pricing decisions while also benefiting from the strength of mcdonald’s global brand operating system and financial resources one of the strengths of this model is that the expertise gained from operating companyowned restaurants allows mcdonald’s to improve the operations and success of all restaurants while innovations from franchisees can be tested and when viable efficiently implemented across relevant restaurants 

directly operating mcdonald’s restaurants contributes significantly to our ability to act as a credible franchisor having companyowned restaurants provides company personnel with a venue for restaurant operations training experience in addition in our companyowned and operated restaurants and in collaboration with franchisees we are able to further develop and refine operating standards marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies that will ultimately benefit relevant mcdonald’s restaurants 

 

under a conventional franchise arrangement the company generally owns the land and building or secures a longterm lease for the restaurant location and the franchisee pays for equipment signs seating and décor the company believes that ownership of real estate combined with the coinvestment by franchisees enables us to achieve restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry 

franchisees are also responsible for reinvesting capital in their businesses over time in addition to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives the company frequently coinvests with franchisees to fund improvements to their restaurants or their operating systems these investments developed with input from mcdonald’s with the aim of improving local business performance increase the value of our brand through the development of modernized more attractive and higher revenue generating restaurants 

the company’s typical franchise term is 20 years the company requires franchisees to meet rigorous standards and generally does not work with passive investors the business relationship with franchisees is designed to assure consistency and high quality at all mcdonald’s restaurants conventional franchisees contribute to the company’s revenue through the payment of rent and royalties based upon a percent of sales with specified minimum rent payments along with initial fees paid upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new franchise this structure enables mcdonald’s to generate significant levels of cash flow 

under a developmental license arrangement licensees provide capital for the entire business including the real estate interest the company does not invest any capital under a developmental license arrangement the company receives a royalty based upon a percent of sales as well as initial fees upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new license we use the developmental license ownership structure in over 80 countries with a total of approximately 6300  restaurants the largest developmental licensee operates approximately 2200  restaurants in 19  countries in latin america and the caribbean in early 2017 the company announced the sale of its businesses in china and hong kong including more than 1750 companyoperated restaurants to a developmental licensee under the terms of the agreement the company will retain a 20 ownership in the businessthe company expects to complete the sale and licensing transaction midyear 2017 

finally the company also has an equity investment in a limited number of foreign affiliated markets referred to as “affiliates” in these markets the company receives a royalty based on a percent of sales and records its share of net results in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates the largest of these affiliates is japan where there are nearly 3000  restaurants 

 the company and its franchisees purchase food packaging equipment and other goods from numerous independent suppliers the company has established and enforces high quality standards and product specifications the company has quality centers around the world designed to ensure that its high standards are consistently met the quality assurance process not only involves ongoing product reviews but also onsite supplier visits a food safety advisory council composed of the company’s technical safety and supply chain specialists as well as suppliers and outside academia provides strategic global leadership for all aspects of food safety in addition the company works closely with suppliers to encourage innovation assure best practices and drive continuous improvement leveraging scale supply chain infrastructure and risk management strategies the company also collaborates with suppliers toward a goal of

 mcdonald’s restaurants compete with international national regional and local retailers of food products the company competes on the basis of price convenience service menu variety and product quality in a highly fragmented global restaurant industry 

in measuring the company’s competitive position management reviews data compiled by euromonitor international a leading source of market data with respect to the global restaurant industry the company’s primary competition which is referred to as the informal eating out ieo segment includes the following restaurant categories defined by euromonitor international quickservice eating establishments casual dining fullservice restaurants street stalls or kiosks cafés100 home deliverytakeaway providers specialist coffee shops selfservice cafeterias and juicesmoothie bars the ieo segment excludes establishments that primarily serve alcohol and fullservice restaurants other than casual dining 

based on data from euromonitor international the global ieo segment was composed of approximately 8 million  outlets and generated 12 trillion  in annual sales in 2015  the most recent year for which data is available mcdonald’s systemwide 2015  restaurant business accounted for 04  of those outlets and 70  of the sales 

management also on occasion benchmarks mcdonald’s against the entire restaurant industry including the ieo segment defined above and all other fullservice restaurants based on data from euromonitor international the restaurant industry was composed of approximately 18 million  outlets and generated 23 trillion  in annual sales in 2015  mcdonald’s systemwide restaurant business accounted for 02  of those outlets and 35  of the sales 

 the company operates research and development facilities in the us europe and asia while research and development activities are important to the company’s business these expenditures are not material independent suppliers also conduct research activities that benefit the company its franchisees and suppliers collectively referred to as the system 

 the company continuously endeavors to improve its social responsibility and environmental practices to achieve longterm sustainability which benefits mcdonald’s and the communities it serves 

increased focus by certain governmental authorities on environmental matters may lead to new governmental initiatives while we cannot predict the precise nature of these initiatives we expect that they may impact our business both directly and indirectly although the impact would likely vary by world region andor market we believe that adoption of new regulations may increase costs for the company also there is a possibility that governmental initiatives or actual or perceived effects of changes in weather patterns climate or water resources could have a direct impact on the operations of the system in ways which we cannot predict at this time 

the company monitors developments related to environmental matters and plans to respond to governmental initiatives in a timely and appropriate manner at this time the company has already begun to undertake its own initiatives relating to preservation of the environment including the implementation of more energy efficient equipment and management of energy use and more sustainable sourcing practices in many of its markets

 item 1a risk factors and cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements 

  

tableend

  

the information in this report includes forwardlooking statements about future events and circumstances and their effects upon revenues expenses and business opportunities generally speaking any statement in this report not based upon historical fact is a forwardlooking statement forwardlooking statements can also be identified by the use of forwardlooking words such as “may” “will” “expect” “believe” and “plan” or similar expressions in particular statements regarding our plans strategies prospects and expectations regarding our business and industry are forwardlooking statements they reflect our expectations are not guarantees of performance and 

 

speak only as of the date of this report except as required by law we do not undertake to update them our expectations or the underlying assumptions may change or not be realized and you should not rely unduly on forwardlooking statements our business results are subject to a variety of risks including those that are reflected in the following considerations and factors as well as elsewhere in our filings with the sec if any of these considerations or risks materialize our expectations may change and our performance may be adversely affected   

if we do not successfully design and execute against our new business strategies within our new organization structure we may not be able to increase operating income or market share   

to drive future results we must design business strategies that are effective in delivering operating income growth whether these strategies are successful depends mainly on our system’s ability to   

 if we are delayed or unsuccessful in executing our strategies or if our strategies do not yield the desired results our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer   

the implementation of our turnaround plan may intensify the risks we face and may not be successful in achieving improved performance   

our turnaround plan includes an accelerated pace of refranchising cost savings initiatives and global restructuring as we continue to implement our plans the existing risks we face in our business may be intensified our efforts to reduce costs and capital expenditures depend in part upon our refranchising efforts which in turn depend upon our ability to select qualified and capable franchisees and licensees our cost savings initiatives also depend upon our ability to achieve efficiencies through the consolidation of global backoffice functions therefore if our turnaroundrelated initiatives are not successful take longer to complete than initially projected or are not well executed or if our cost reduction efforts adversely impact our effectiveness our business operations financial results and results of operations could be adversely affected   

our investments to enhance the customer experience including through technology may not generate the expected returns   

we will continue to build upon our investments in experience of the future “eotf” which focus on restaurant modernization and technology and digital engagement in order to transform the restaurant experience as we accelerate our pace of converting restaurants to eotf we are placing renewed emphasis on our improving our service model and strengthening relationships with customers in part through digital channels and loyalty initiatives we may not fully realize the intended benefits of these significant investments and therefore our business results may suffer   

  

mcdonalds corporation 2016 annual report 3 

we face intense competition in our markets which could hurt our business   

we compete primarily in the “informal eating out” ieo segment which is highly competitive we are facing sluggish restaurant industry trends in several key markets including the us we also face sustained intense competition from traditional fast casual and other competitors which may include many nontraditional market participants such as convenience stores grocery stores and coffee shops we expect our environment to continue to be highly competitive and our results in any particular reporting period may be impacted by new or continuing actions of our competitors which may have a short or longterm impact on our results   

we compete on the basis of product choice quality affordability service and location in particular we believe our ability to compete successfully in the current market environment depends on our ability to improve existing products develop new products price our products appropriately deliver a relevant customer experience manage the complexity of our restaurant operations and respond effectively to our competitors’ actions recognizing these dependencies we have intensified our focus in recent periods on strategies to achieve these goals including the turnaround plan described above and we will likely continue to modify our strategies and implement new strategies in the future there can be no assurance these strategies will be effective and some strategies may be effective at improving some metrics while adversely affecting other metrics   

if we do not anticipate and address evolving consumer preferences our business could suffer   

our continued success depends on our system’s ability to anticipate and respond effectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics and trends in food sourcing food preparation and consumer preferences in the ieo segment in order to deliver a relevant experience for our customers amidst a highly competitive valuedriven operating environment we must implement initiatives to adapt at an aggressive pace there is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful and if they are not our financial results could be adversely impacted   

if pricing promotional and marketing plans are not effective our results may be negatively impacted   

our results depend on the impact of pricing promotional and marketing plans across the system and the ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly and effectively to evolving customer preferences as well as shifting economic and competitive conditions existing or future pricing strategies and the value proposition they represent are expected to continue to be important components of our business strategy however they may not be successful and could negatively impact sales and margins further the promotion of menu offerings may yield results below the desired levels   

additionally we operate in a complex and costly advertising environment our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful and we may fail to attract and retain customers our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising and marketing resources across different channels allows us to reach our customers effectively if the advertising and marketing programs are not successful or are not as successful as those of our competitors our sales guest counts and market share could decrease   

failure to preserve the value and relevance of our brand could have a negative impact on our financial results   

 

to be successful in the future we believe we must preserve enhance and leverage the value of our brand brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions those perceptions are affected by a variety of factors including the nutritional content and preparation of our food the ingredients we use our business practices and the manner in which we source the commodities we use consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons and some changes can occur rapidly for example nutritional health and other scientific studies and conclusions which constantly evolve and may have contradictory implications drive popular opinion litigation and regulation including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior in ways that affect the ieo segment or perceptions of our brand generally or relative to available alternatives consumer perceptions may also be affected by third parties presenting or promoting adverse commentary or portrayals of the quickservice category of the ieo segment our brand andor our operations our suppliers or our franchisees if we are unsuccessful in addressing such adverse commentary or portrayals our brand and our financial results may suffer   

additionally the ongoing relevance of our brand may depend on the success of our sustainability initiatives which require systemwide coordination and alignment if we are not effective in addressing social responsibility matters or achieving relevant sustainability goals consumer trust in our brand may suffer in particular business incidents that erode consumer trust or confidence particularly if such incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results   

unfavorable general economic conditions could adversely affect our business and financial results   

our results of operations are substantially affected by economic conditions which can vary significantly by market and can impact consumer disposable income levels and spending habits economic conditions can also be impacted by a variety of factors including hostilities epidemics and actions taken by governments to manage national and international economic matters whether through austerity or stimulus measures or trade measures and initiatives intended to control wages unemployment credit availability inflation taxation and other economic drivers continued adverse economic conditions or adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets could pressure our operating performance and our business and financial results may suffer   

our results of operations are also affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may adversely affect reported earnings   

supply chain interruptions may increase costs or reduce revenues   

we depend on the effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure reliable and sufficient product supply including on favorable terms although many of the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers in countries around the world certain products have limited suppliers which may increase our reliance on those suppliers supply chain interruptions including shortages and transportation issues and price increases can adversely affect us as well as our suppliers and franchisees whose performance may have a significant impact on our results such shortages or disruptions could be caused by factors beyond the control of our suppliers franchisees or us if we experience interruptions in our system’s supply chain our costs could increase and it could limit the availability of products critical to our system’s operations   

4     mcdonalds corporation 2016 annual report 

food safety concerns may have an adverse effect on our business   

our ability to increase sales and profits depends on our system’s ability to meet expectations for safe food and on our ability to manage the potential impact on mcdonald’s of foodborne illnesses and food or product safety issues that may arise in the future food safety is a top priority and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe food products including as our menu evolves however food safety events including instances of foodborne illness have occurred in the food industry in the past and could occur in the future instances of food tampering food contamination or foodborne illness whether actual or perceived could adversely affect our brand and reputation as well as our revenues and profits   

our franchise business model presents a number of risks   

our success increasingly relies on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees yet we have limited influence over their operations our restaurant margins arise from two sources fees from franchised restaurants eg rent and royalties based on a percentage of sales and to a lesser degree sales from companyoperated restaurants our franchisees manage their businesses independently and therefore are responsible for the daytoday operation of their restaurants the revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales if our franchisees do not experience sales growth our revenues and margins could be negatively affected as a result also if sales trends worsen for franchisees their financial results may deteriorate which could result in among other things restaurant closures or delayed or reduced payments to us our refranchising effort will increase that dependence and the effect of those factors   

our success also increasingly depends on the willingness and ability of our independent franchisees to implement major initiatives which may include financial investment and to remain aligned with us on operating promotional and capitalintensive reinvestment plans franchisees’ ability to contribute to the achievement of our plans is dependent in large part on the availability to them of funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general or by the creditworthiness of our franchisees or the company our operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety or other operational problems or project an image inconsistent with our brand and values particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited costly to exercise or subjected to litigation if franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards the brand’s image and reputation could be harmed which in turn could hurt our business and operating results   

our ownership mix also affects our results and financial condition the decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex and changing our ability to achieve the benefits of our refranchising strategy which involves a shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants in a timely manner or at all will depend on various factors including our ability to timely and effectively select franchisees andor licensees that meet our rigorous standards andor to complete transactions on favorable terms and to manage associated risks it will also depend on the performance of our franchisees and whether the resulting ownership mix supports our financial objectives   

 

challenges with respect to talent management could harm our business   

effective succession planning is important to our longterm success failure effectively to identify develop and retain key personnel recruit highquality candidates and ensure smooth management and personnel transitions could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results   

our success depends in part on our system’s ability to recruit motivate and retain a qualified workforce to work in our restaurants in an intensely competitive environment increased costs associated with recruiting motivating and retaining qualified employees to work in our companyoperated restaurants could have a negative impact on our companyoperated margins similar concerns apply to our franchisees   

we are also impacted by the costs and other effects of compliance with us and international regulations affecting our workforce which includes our staff and employees working in our companyoperated restaurants these regulations are increasingly focused on employment issues including wage and hour healthcare immigration retirement and other employee benefits and workplace practices our potential exposure to reputational and other harm regarding our workplace practices or conditions or those of our independent franchisees or suppliers or perceptions thereof could have a negative impact on consumer perceptions of us and our business additionally economic action such as boycotts protests work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations could adversely affect us including our ability to recruit and retain talent or the franchisees and suppliers that are also part of the mcdonalds system and whose performance may have a material impact on our results   

changes in commodity and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations   

the profitability of our companyoperated restaurants depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs including food paper supply fuel utilities distribution and other operating costs any volatility in certain commodity prices could adversely affect our operating results by impacting restaurant profitability the commodity markets for some of the ingredients we use such as beef and chicken are particularly volatile due to factors such as seasonal shifts climate conditions industry demand international commodity markets food safety concerns product recalls and government regulation all of which are beyond our control and in many instances unpredictable we can only partially address future price risk through hedging and other activities and therefore increases in commodity costs could have an adverse impact on our profitability   

the global scope of our business subjects us to risks that could negatively affect our business   

we encounter differing cultural regulatory and economic environments within and among the more than 100 countries where mcdonald’s restaurants operate and our ability to achieve our business objectives depends on the systems success in these environments meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment and our global success is partially dependent on our system’s ability to leverage operating successes across markets planned initiatives may not have appeal across multiple markets with mcdonalds customers and could drive unanticipated changes in customer perceptions and guest counts   

disruptions in operations or price volatility in a market can also result from governmental actions such as price 

  

mcdonalds corporation 2016 annual report 5 

foreign exchange or changes in traderelated tariffs or controls governmentmandated closure of our our franchisees or our suppliers’ operations and asset seizures the cost and disruption of responding to governmental investigations or inquiries whether or not they have merit may impact our results and could cause reputational or other harm our international success depends in part on the effectiveness of our strategies and brandbuilding initiatives to reduce our exposure to such governmental investigations or inquiries   

additionally challenges and uncertainties are associated with operating in developing markets which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability economic volatility crime corruption and social and ethnic unrest such challenges may be exacerbated in many cases by a lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainties in how local law is applied and enforced including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment an inability to manage effectively the risks associated with our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition   

we may also face challenges and uncertainties in developed markets for example as a result of the uks decision to leave the european union through a negotiated exit over a period of time it is possible that there will be increased regulatory complexities as well as potential referenda in the uk andor other european countries that could cause uncertainty in european or worldwide economic conditions in the short term the decision created volatility in certain foreign currency exchange rates and the resulting depression in those exchange rates may continue any of these effects and others we cannot anticipate could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows   

changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability   

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and foreign jurisdictions and our operations plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives around the world in particular we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or policy or related authoritative interpretations including to the extent that corporate tax reform becomes a key component of budgetary initiatives in the united states or elsewhere we are also impacted by settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by taxing authorities outside of the us or the irs in connection with our tax audits all of which will depend on their timing nature and scope any increases in income tax rates changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results   

information technology system failures or interruptions or breaches of network security may interrupt our operations   

we are increasingly reliant on technological systems such as pointofsale and other instore systems or platforms as well as technologies that facilitate communication and collaboration internally with affiliated entities or with independent third parties to conduct our business including technologyenabled solutions provided to us by third parties any failure of these systems could significantly impact our operations and customer perceptions   

despite the implementation of security measures those technology systems and solutions could become vulnerable to damage disability or failures due to theft fire power loss telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events the third party solutions also present the risks faced by the third party’s business if those systems or solutions were to fail or otherwise be unavailable and we were unable to recover in a 

 

timely way we could experience an interruption in our operations   

furthermore security breaches involving our systems the systems of the parties we communicate or collaborate with or those of third party providers may occur such as unauthorized access denial of service computer viruses and other disruptive problems caused by hackers our information technology systems contain personal financial and other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees as well as financial proprietary and other confidential information related to our business an actual or alleged security breach could result in system disruptions shutdowns theft or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information the occurrence of any of these incidents could result in adverse publicity loss of consumer confidence reduced sales and profits and criminal penalties or civil liabilities   

increasing regulatory complexity may adversely affect restaurant operations and our financial results   

our regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance and similar risks that could affect our operations and results in material ways in many of our markets we are subject to increasing regulation which has increased our cost of doing business we are affected by the cost compliance and other risks associated with the often conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations we face including where inconsistent standards imposed by multiple governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings   

our success depends in part on our ability to manage the impact of new potential or changing regulations that can affect our business plans and operations these regulations include product packaging marketing the nutritional content and safety of our food and other products labeling and other disclosure practices and compliance efforts may be affected by ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from thirdparty suppliers particularly given varying requirements and practices for testing and disclosure   

additionally we are working to manage the risks and costs to us our franchisees and our supply chain of the effects of climate change greenhouse gases and diminishing energy and water resources these risks include the increased public focus including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations on these and other environmental sustainability matters such as packaging and waste animal health and welfare deforestation and land use these risks also include the increased pressure to make commitments set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them these risks could expose us to market operational and execution costs or risks if we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with our complex regulatory environment it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition   

we are subject to increasing legal complexity and could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us   

increasing legal complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways we could be subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business including class actions administrative proceedings government investigations employment and personal injury claims landlordtenant disputes disputes with current or former suppliers claims by current or former franchisees and intellectual property claims including claims that we infringed another party’s trademarks copyrights or patents   

6     mcdonalds corporation 2016 annual report 

inconsistent standards imposed by governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to regulatory proceedings or litigation   

litigation involving our relationship with franchisees and the legal distinction between our franchisees and us for employment law purposes if determined adversely could increase costs negatively impact the business prospects of our franchisees and subject us to incremental liability for their actions similarly although our commercial relationships with our suppliers remain independent there may be attempts to challenge that independence which if determined adversely could also increase costs negatively impact the business prospects of our suppliers and subject us to incremental liability for their actions we are also subject to legal and compliance risks and associated liability such as in the areas of privacy and data collection protection and management as it relates to information we collect and share when we provide optional technologyrelated services and platforms to third parties   

our operating results could also be affected by the following   

 a judgment significantly in excess of any applicable insurance coverage or third party indemnity could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations further adverse publicity resulting from these claims may hurt our business   

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately ensure that we are not infringing the intellectual property of others which could harm the value of the mcdonald’s brand and our business   

the success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights service marks trade secrets patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products   

we have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions the trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the united states in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the united states and foreign countries may not be adequate in addition the steps we have taken may not adequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future in particular we may be involved in intellectual property claims including often aggressive or opportunistic attempts to enforce patents used in information technology systems which might affect our operations and results any claim of infringement whether or 

 

not it has merit could be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and harm our business   

we cannot ensure that franchisees and other third parties who hold licenses to our intellectual property will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property   

changes in accounting standards or the recognition of impairment or other charges may adversely affect our future operations and results   

new accounting standards or changes in financial reporting requirements accounting principles or practices including with respect to our critical accounting estimates could adversely affect our future results we may also be affected by the nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets including decisions that result in impairment or other charges that reduce our earnings in assessing the recoverability of our longlived assets we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors these estimates are highly subjective and can be significantly impacted by many factors such as global and local business and economic conditions operating costs inflation competition consumer and demographic trends and our restructuring activities if our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges if we experience any such changes they could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results for the affected periods   

a decrease in our credit ratings or an increase in our funding costs could adversely affect our profitability   

our credit ratings may be negatively affected by our results of operations or changes in our debt levels as a result our interest expense the availability of acceptable counterparties our ability to obtain funding on favorable terms collateral requirements and our operating or financial flexibility could all be negatively affected especially if lenders impose new operating or financial covenants   

our operations may also be impacted by regulations affecting capital flows financial markets or financial institutions which can limit our ability to manage and deploy our liquidity or increase our funding costs if any of these events were to occur they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition   

trading volatility and price of our common stock may be adversely affected by many factors   

many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects the most important of these factors some of which are outside our control are the following   



  

mcdonalds corporation 2016 annual report 7 

performance actions by shareholders and others seeking to influence our business strategies portfolio transactions in our stock by significant shareholders or trading activity that results from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which mcdonald’s may be included such as the sp 500 index and the dow jones industrial average   

 our results and prospects can be adversely affected by events such as severe weather conditions natural disasters hostilities and social unrest among others   

severe weather conditions natural disasters hostilities and social unrest terrorist activities health epidemics or pandemics or expectations about them can adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels and supply availability and costs as well as the local operations in impacted markets all of which can affect our results and prospects our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to some of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to cover our losses fully

given the company’s returns on incremental invested capital and assets management believes it is prudent to reinvest in the business in markets with acceptable returns andor opportunity for longterm growth and use excess cash flow to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases the company has paid dividends on common stock for 41  consecutive years through 2016  and has increased the dividend amount at least once every year as in the past future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs and will be declared at the discretion of the company’s board of directors

at least annually we consider which companies comprise a readily identifiable investment peer group mcdonalds is included in published restaurant indices however unlike most other companies included in these indices which have no or limited international operations mcdonalds does business in more than 100 countries and a substantial portion of our revenues and income is generated outside the us in addition because of our size mcdonalds inclusion in those indices tends to skew the results therefore we believe that such a comparison is not meaningful 

our market capitalization trading volume and importance in an industry that is vital to the us economy have resulted in mcdonalds inclusion in the dow jones industrial average djia since 1985 like mcdonalds many djia companies generate meaningful revenues and income outside the us and some manage global brands thus we believe that the use of the djia companies as the group for comparison purposes is appropriate 

the following performance graph shows mcdonalds cumulative total shareholder returns ie price appreciation and reinvestment of dividends relative to the standard  poors 500 stock index sp 500 index and to the djia companies for the fiveyear period ended december 31 2016  the graph assumes that the value of an investment in mcdonalds common stock the sp 500 index and the djia companies including mcdonalds was 100 at december 31 2011  for the djia companies returns are weighted for market capitalization as of the beginning of each period indicated these returns may vary from those of the dow jones industrial average index which is not weighted by market capitalization and may be composed of different companies during the period under consideration

 strategic direction and financial performance   

the strength of the alignment among the company its franchisees and suppliers collectively referred to as the system is key to mcdonalds longterm success by leveraging the system mcdonald’s is able to identify implement and scale ideas that meet customers changing needs and preferences mcdonalds continually builds on its competitive advantages of system alignment and geographic diversification to deliver consistent yet locallyrelevant restaurant experiences to customers as an integral part of their communities

building on these initial steps the company made purposeful changes in 2016 the company continued to rightsize the organization and put the appropriate talent in place by blending executives with deep mcdonald’s experience with new executives to generate fresh energy and innovative ideas while successfully executing against the key elements of its turnaround plan as reflected by improved customer satisfaction measures across most of the major markets customers have taken notice 

in addition to the customerrelevant changes in the restaurants the company has enhanced financial value through its refranchising efforts cost savings initiatives and cash return to shareholders as follows 

 moving to a more heavily franchised business model will benefit the company’s performance over the long term as the rent and royalty income received from franchisees will provide a more predictable and stable revenue stream with significantly lower operating costs and risks this model is less capital intensive as franchisees are responsible for reinvesting capital in their businesses 



 

against its refranchising targets have resulted in savings of more than 200 million

impact of foreign currency translation on reported results 

while changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results mcdonald’s mitigates exposures where practical by purchasing goods and services in local currencies financing in local currencies and hedging certain foreigndenominated cash flows 

foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results in each of the last three years in 2016 results were negatively impacted by the weaker british pound as well as many other currencies in 2015 results were negatively impacted by the weaker euro australian dollar russian ruble and most other currencies   in 2014 results were negatively impacted by the weaker russian ruble australian dollar and certain other currencies partly offset by the stronger british pound 

impact of foreign currency translation on reported results 



  

net income and diluted earnings per common share 

in 2016  net income increased   3   6  in constant currencies to 47 billion  and diluted earnings per common share increased 13   16  in constant currencies to 544  foreign currency translation had a negative impact of 011  on diluted earnings per share 

in 2015  net income decreased 5 increased 5 in constant currencies to 45 billion  and diluted earnings per common share was relatively flat increased 10 in constant currencies at 480  foreign currency translation had a negative impact of 050 on diluted earnings per share 

results in 2016 benefited from stronger operating performance and higher gains on sales of restaurant businesses mostly in the us while results in 2015 benefited from higher franchised margins and a gain on the strategic sale of a unique restaurant property in the us 

 

both 2016 and 2015 results were partly offset by net pretax impairment and other charges of 342 million and 307 million respectively primarily related to goodwill impairment and other asset writeoffs in conjunction with the companys refranchising initiatives restructuring and incremental restaurant closings the 2015 charges combined with the gain on the strategic sale of a unique restaurant property in the us had a net negative impact on diluted earnings per share of 018 in 2015 while the 2016 charges had a net negative impact on diluted earnings per share of 028 in 2016 

the company repurchased 923 million  shares of its stock for 111 billion  in 2016  and 618 million  shares of its stock for 62 billion  in 2015  driving reductions in weightedaverage shares outstanding on a diluted basis in both periods which positively benefited earnings per share

revenues 

the company’s revenues consist of sales by companyoperated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales minimum rent payments and initial fees revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales and generally include initial fees 

the company continues to accelerate the pace of refranchising to optimize its restaurant ownership mix generate more stable and predictable revenue and cash flow streams and operate with a less resourceintensive structure the shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants negatively impacts consolidated revenues as companyoperated sales are replaced by franchised sales where the company receives rent andor royalty revenue based on a percentage of sales 

in 2016  revenues decreased 3 flat in constant currencies due to the impact of refranchising partly offset by positive comparable sales in 2015 revenues decreased 7 increased 3 in constant currencies partly due to foreign currency translation in constant currencies revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales and the benefit from expansion

franchised margin dollars represent revenues from franchised restaurants less the company’s occupancy costs rent and depreciation associated with those sites franchised margin dollars represented about 75 of the combined restaurant margins in 2016  2015  and 2014  

in 2016  franchised margin dollars increased   331 million  or 5   6  in constant currencies in 2015  franchised margin dollars decreased 297 million  or 4  increased 4  in constant currencies due to foreign currency translation for both 2016 and 2015 the constant currency increases were due to positive comparable sales performance expansion and refranchising 

in connection with the companys refranchising initiatives the company expects to refranchise about 4000 restaurants for the threeyear period ending 2017 while this refranchising activity may have a dilutive effect on the franchised margin percent it typically results in higher franchised margin dollars 

franchised margins 





 

 the franchised margin percent in foundational markets  corporate is higher relative to the other segments due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed andor affiliated restaurants where the company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs

selling general  administrative expenses 

consolidated selling general and administrative expenses decreased   2   1  in constant currencies in 2016  and decreased 2 increased 4 in constant currencies in 2015  the decrease in 2016 was due to lower employeerelated costs resulting from the companys recent restructuring and other costsaving initiatives mostly offset by higher incentivebased compensation expenses reflecting improved company performance the decrease in 2015 benefited from foreign currency translation in constant currencies selling general and administrative expenses increased due to higher incentivebased compensation costs reflecting improved performance partly offset by lower employeerelated costs resulting from the companys restructuring initiatives 

selling general  administrative expenses 



 selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales was 28  in 2016  29  in 2015  and 28  in 2014  management believes that analyzing selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support the overall mcdonalds business 

in connection with our turnaround plan the company established a net selling general and administrative savings target of 500 million to be achieved by the end of 2018 excluding the effects of any foreign currency changes these savings represent a reduction of about 20 from our selling general and administrative base of 26 billion at the beginning of 2015 this base included incentivebased compensation of approximately 330 million which assumed achievement of planned operating performance in 2014 the lower incentivebased compensation reflected nominal payouts for the companys shortterm cash bonus program

operating income and monthend asset balances are used to compute return on average assets for the years ended 2016 2015 and 2014 return on average assets was 230 209 and 218 respectively 

in 2016 return on average assets increased due to higher operating income and lower average assets in 2015 return on average assets decreased primarily due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation on operating income partly offset by lower average assets operating income does not include interest income however cash balances are included in average assets the inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by about three percentage points for all years presented

standard  poor’s and moody’s currently rate with a stable outlook the company’s commercial paper a2 and p2 respectively and its longterm debt bbb and baa1 respectively to access the debt capital markets the company relies on creditrating agencies to assign shortterm and longterm credit ratings 

certain of the company’s debt obligations contain crossacceleration provisions and restrictions on company and subsidiary mortgages and the longterm debt of certain subsidiaries there are no provisions in the company’s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the company’s business under existing authorization from the company’s board of directors at december 31 2016  the company had 150 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds including through i public or private offering of debt securities ii direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions and iii other forms of indebtedness in addition to debt securities available through a mediumterm notes program registered with the us securities and exchange commission sec and a global mediumterm notes program the company has 25 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the us and global markets see debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements debt maturing in 2017 is 16 billion of longterm corporate debt the company plans to issue longterm debt to refinance this maturing debt as of december 31 2016  the companys subsidiaries also had 489 million of borrowings outstanding primarily under uncommitted foreign currency line of credit agreements of which 297 million is classified in liabilities of businesses held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet

in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations the company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated the company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties intercompany financings and longterm investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates this reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders’ equity total foreign currencydenominated debt was 89 billion and 70 billion for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015 respectively in addition where practical the company’s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges see the summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives 

the company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below or aggregate exposures exceed certain contractual limits at december 31 2016  the company was required to post an immaterial amount of collateral due to negative fair value of certain 

24     mcdonalds corporation 2016 annual report 

derivative positions the companys counterparties were not required to post collateral on any derivative position other than on hedges of certain of the company’s supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions 

the company’s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies the company’s largest net asset exposures defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities at year end were as follows 

foreign currency net asset exposures 



the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the company’s results of operations cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments the interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10 in the same direction relative to the us dollar on all financial instruments however the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets based on the results of these analyses of the company’s financial instruments neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2016  levels nor a 10 adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2016  levels would materially affect the company’s results of operations cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments 

liquidity 

the company has significant operations outside the us where we earn about 60 of our operating income a significant portion of these historical earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the company has made and will continue to make substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations accordingly no us federal or state income taxes have been provided on these undistributed foreign earnings the companys cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately 663 million as of december 31 2016  we do not intend nor do we foresee a need to repatriate these funds 

consistent with prior years we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents domestic cash flows from operations annual repatriation of a portion of the current periods foreign earnings and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating investing and financing activities we also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating investing and financing activities 

in the future should we require more capital to fund activities in the us than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods earnings from foreign jurisdictions this could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the future 

 

while the likelihood is remote to the extent foreign cash is available the company could also elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise the company may be subject to additional us income taxes net of an adjustment for foreign tax credits which could result in a use of cash this could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the period in which such a determination is made to repatriate prior period foreign earnings refer to the income taxes note to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to our income taxes and the undistributed earnings of the companys foreign subsidiaries 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the company has longterm contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations related to both companyoperated and franchised restaurants and debt obligations in addition the company has longterm revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements cash provided by operations including cash provided by these franchise arrangements along with the company’s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations the following table summarizes the company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the company under existing franchise arrangements as of december 31 2016  see discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

 in the us the company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to i make taxdeferred contributions and ii receive companyprovided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of internal revenue service irs limitations at december 31 2016  total liabilities for the supplemental plans were 465 million  

in addition total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were 924 million  at december 31 2016  

there are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction inventory energy marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business and timing of such payments are not

estimable or determinable the amounts related to these commitments are not significant to the company’s financial position such commitments are generally shorter term in nature and will be funded from operating cash flows 



critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates 

the company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

 property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straightline basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets taking into account anticipated technological or other changes the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors economic factors and industry trends if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or writeoffs in future periods 

 assets and liabilities of businesses held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet primarily consist of balances related to businesses in china and hong kong in december 2016 the company’s board of directors approved an agreement for the company to sell its existing businesses in china and hong kong which comprise over 2600 restaurants to a developmental licensee organization under the terms of the agreement the company will retain a 20 ownership in the business the company expects to complete the sale and licensing transaction midyear 2017 subject to satisfaction of customary conditions including receipt of any regulatory approvals 

based on approval by the board of directors the company concluded that these markets were “held for sale” as of december 31 2016 in accordance with the requirements of asc 360 “property plant and equipment” accordingly the company has ceased recording depreciation expense with respect to the assets of the china and hong kong markets effective january 1 2017 as of december 31 2016 total assets relating to businesses in china and hong kong were 13 billion of which 217 million was current and total liabilities were 592 million most of which was current 

 

as a result of this sale the company expects to record a gain of approximately 700900 million reflecting the difference between the net book value of the businesses and an estimated 15 billion of cash proceeds to be received at closing subject to adjustments 

 the company has a sharebased compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equitybased incentives including stock options and restricted stock units rsus to employees and nonemployee directors the expense for these equitybased incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period the company estimates forfeitures when determining the amount of compensation costs to be recognized in each period 

the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closedform pricing model the pricing model requires assumptions which impact the assumed fair value including the expected life of the stock option the riskfree interest rate expected volatility of the company’s stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield the company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants sharebased compensation expense will fluctuate in future years the fair value of each rsu granted is equal to the market price of the company’s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period 

 longlived assets including goodwill are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in assessing the recoverability of the company’s longlived assets the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the company’s experience and knowledge of its operations these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions operating costs inflation competition and consumer and demographic trends a key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales if the company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future the company may be required to record impairment charges based on the annual goodwill impairment test conducted in the fourth quarter approximately 510 of goodwill may be at risk of future impairment as the fair values of certain reporting units were not substantially in excess of their carrying amounts 

 in the ordinary course of business the company is subject to proceedings lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors customers employees franchisees government agencies intellectual property shareholders and suppliers the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses a determination of the amount of accrual required if any for these contingencies is made after 

careful analysis of each matter the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters the company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 

26     mcdonalds corporation 2016 annual report 

 the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies including the sale of appreciated assets in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if these estimates and assumptions change in the future the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance this could result in a charge to or an increase in income in the period such determination is made 

the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 

in 2016 the company increased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken in prior years by 150 million in 2015 the company decreased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits related to settlements with taxing authorities by 258 million see the income taxes footnote in the consolidated financial statements for the related tax reconciliations the most significant new developments in 2015 and 2016 are described below 

in 2015 the company received an unfavorable decision related to its procedural efforts to appeal a prior year unfavorable lower tax court ruling in a foreign tax jurisdiction related to exempt income matters as a result of this new information the company agreed to settle the issue for 20032008 with the tax authorities and the unrecognized tax benefits were reduced by 143 million no cash payment was made related to this settlement in 2015 as the company had previously made a payment to the taxing authority the settlement did not have a material impact on the companys cash flows results of operations or financial position in 2016 the unrecognized tax benefits related to this issue for 20092010 were reduced by 57 million as a result of the lapsing of the statute of limitations 

in 2015 the internal revenue service “irs” issued a revenue agent report for certain agreed adjustments related to the company’s us federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010 and the balance of unrecognized tax benefits was reduced by 102 million also in 2015 the company filed a protest with the irs appeals office related to certain disagreed transfer pricing matters related to the company’s us federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010 as of december 31 2016 the company had not yet received a response to this protest from the irs the company expects resolution on these issues in either 2017 or 2018 in addition the companys 2011 and 2012 us federal income tax returns are currently under examination and the completion of the field audit is expected in 2017 

 

in 2016 the company received new information during the progression of tax audits in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions as a result of this new information the company changed its judgment on the measurement of the related unrecognized tax benefits and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits of 125 million 

in december 2015 the european commission opened a formal investigation directly with the luxembourg government to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with european union rules on state aid if this matter is adversely resolved luxembourg may be required to assess and the company may be required to pay additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase as of december 31 2016 no decision has been published with respect to this investigation 

while the company cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the aforementioned tax matters we believe that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined in accordance with topic 740  income taxes of the accounting standards codification “asc” 

deferred us income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling 160 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates the temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the us if managements intentions change in the future deferred taxes may need to be provided 

effects of changing prices—inflation 

the company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively this ability is because of rapid inventory turnover the ability to adjust menu prices cost controls and substantial property holdings many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation

c narrative description of business 

 the company operates and franchises mcdonald’s restaurants which serve a locallyrelevant menu of quality food and drinks sold at various price points in more than 100 countries mcdonald’s global system is comprised of both companyowned and franchised restaurants mcdonald’s franchised restaurants are owned and operated under one of the following structures  conventional franchise developmental license or affiliate the optimal ownership structure for an individual restaurant trading area or market country is based on a variety of factors including the availability of individuals with the entrepreneurial experience and financial resources as well as the local legal and regulatory environment in critical areas such as property ownership and franchising we continually review our mix of companyowned and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance with a goal to be 95 franchised over the long term the business relationship between mcdonald’s and its independent franchisees is of fundamental importance to overall performance and to the mcdonald’s brand this business relationship is supported by an agreement that requires adherence to standards and policies essential to protecting our brand 

the company is primarily a franchisor with more than 80 of mcdonalds restaurants owned and operated by independent franchisees franchising enables an individual to own a restaurant business and maintain control over staffing purchasing marketing and pricing decisions while also benefiting from the strength of mcdonald’s global brand operating system and financial resources one of the strengths of this model is that the expertise gained from operating companyowned restaurants allows mcdonald’s to improve the operations and success of all restaurants while innovations from franchisees can be tested and when viable efficiently implemented across relevant restaurants 

directly operating mcdonald’s restaurants contributes significantly to our ability to act as a credible franchisor having companyowned restaurants provides company personnel with a venue for restaurant operations training experience in addition in our companyowned and operated restaurants and in collaboration with franchisees we are able to further develop and refine operating standards marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies that will ultimately benefit relevant mcdonald’s restaurants 

 

under a conventional franchise arrangement the company owns the land and building or secures a longterm lease for the restaurant location and the franchisee pays for equipment signs seating and décor the company believes that ownership of real estate combined with the coinvestment by franchisees enables us to achieve restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry 

franchisees are also responsible for reinvesting capital in their businesses over time in addition to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives the company frequently coinvests with franchisees to fund improvements to their restaurants or their operating systems these investments developed with input from mcdonald’s with the aim of improving local business performance increase the value of our brand through the development of modernized more attractive and higher revenue generating restaurants 

the company’s typical franchise term is 20 years the company requires franchisees to meet rigorous standards and generally does not work with passive investors the business relationship with franchisees is designed to assure consistency and high quality at all mcdonald’s restaurants conventional franchisees contribute to the company’s revenue through the payment of rent and royalties based upon a percent of sales with specified minimum rent payments along with initial fees paid upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new franchise this structure enables mcdonald’s to generate significant levels of cash flow 

under a developmental license arrangement licensees provide capital for the entire business including the real estate interest the company does not invest any capital under a developmental license arrangement the company receives a royalty based upon a percent of sales as well as initial fees upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new license we use the developmental license ownership structure in over 70 countries with a total of approximately 5500  restaurants the largest developmental licensee operates approximately 2100  restaurants in 19  countries in latin america and the caribbean 

finally the company also has an equity investment in a limited number of foreign affiliated markets referred to as “affiliates” in these markets the company receives a royalty based on a percent of sales and records its share of net results in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates the largest of these affiliates is japan where there are nearly 3000 restaurants 

 the company and its franchisees purchase food packaging equipment and other goods from numerous independent suppliers the company has established and enforces high quality standards and product specifications the company has quality centers around the world designed to ensure that its high standards are consistently met the quality assurance process not only involves ongoing product reviews but also onsite supplier visits a food safety advisory council composed of the company’s technical safety and supply chain specialists as well as suppliers and outside academia provides strategic global leadership for all aspects of food safety in addition the company works closely with suppliers to encourage innovation assure best practices and drive continuous improvement leveraging scale supply chain infrastructure and risk management strategies the company also collaborates with suppliers toward a goal of achieving competitive predictable food and paper costs over the long term 

independently owned and operated distribution centers approved by the company distribute products and supplies to mcdonald’s restaurants in addition restaurant personnel are trained in the proper storage handling and preparation of products

 the company’s business is not dependent upon either a single customer or small group of customers 

 companyoperated restaurants have no backlog orders 

 no material portion of the business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at government election 

 mcdonald’s restaurants compete with international national regional and local retailers of food products the company competes on the basis of price convenience service menu variety and product quality in a highly fragmented global restaurant industry 

 

in measuring the company’s competitive position management reviews data compiled by euromonitor international a leading source of market data with respect to the global restaurant industry the company’s primary competition which is referred to as the informal eating out ieo segment includes the following restaurant categories defined by euromonitor international quickservice eating establishments casual dining fullservice restaurants street stalls or kiosks cafés100 home deliverytakeaway providers specialist coffee shops selfservice cafeterias and juicesmoothie bars the ieo segment excludes establishments that primarily serve alcohol and fullservice restaurants other than casual dining 

based on data from euromonitor international the global ieo segment was composed of approximately 8 million  outlets and generated 12 trillion  in annual sales in 2014  the most recent year for which data is available mcdonald’s systemwide 2014  restaurant business accounted for 05  of those outlets and 72  of the sales 

management also on occasion benchmarks mcdonald’s against the entire restaurant industry including the ieo segment defined above and all other fullservice restaurants based on data from euromonitor international the restaurant industry was composed of approximately 17 million  outlets and generated 24 trillion  in annual sales in 2014  mcdonald’s systemwide restaurant business accounted for 02  of those outlets and 36  of the sales 

 the company operates research and development facilities in the us europe and asia while research and development activities are important to the company’s business these expenditures are not material independent suppliers also conduct research activities that benefit the company its franchisees and suppliers collectively referred to as the system 

 the company continuously endeavors to improve its social responsibility and environmental practices to achieve longterm sustainability which benefits mcdonald’s and the communities it serves 

increased focus by us and overseas governmental authorities on environmental matters is likely to lead to new governmental initiatives particularly in the area of climate change while we cannot predict the precise nature of these initiatives we expect that they may impact our business both directly and indirectly although the impact would likely vary by world region andor market we believe that adoption of new regulations may increase costs for the company also there is a possibility that governmental initiatives or actual or perceived effects of changes in weather patterns climate or water resources could have a direct impact on the operations of the system in ways which we cannot predict at this time 

the company monitors developments related to environmental matters and plans to respond to governmental initiatives in a timely and appropriate manner at this time the company has already begun to undertake its own initiatives relating to preservation of the environment including the implementation of more energy efficient equipment and management of energy use and more sustainable sourcing practices in many of its markets

tableend

  

the information in this report includes forwardlooking statements about future events and circumstances and their effects upon revenues expenses and business opportunities generally speaking any statement in this report not based upon historical fact is a forwardlooking statement forwardlooking statements can also be identified by the use of forwardlooking words such as “may” “will” “expect” “believe” and “plan” or similar expressions in particular statements regarding our plans strategies prospects and expectations regarding our business and industry are forwardlooking statements they reflect our expectations are not guarantees of performance and speak only as of the date of this report except as required by law we do not undertake to update them our expectations or the underlying assumptions may 

 

change or not be realized and you should not rely unduly on forwardlooking statements our business results are subject to a variety of risks including those that are reflected in the following considerations and factors as well as elsewhere in our filings with the sec if any of these considerations or risks materialize our expectations may change and our performance may be adversely affected 

if we do not successfully design and execute our business strategies we may not be able to increase revenues or market share 

to drive future results our business strategies must be effective in achieving market share gains while at the same time delivering operating income growth whether we successfully execute these strategies depends mainly on our system’s ability to 

 if we are delayed or unsuccessful in executing our strategies or if our strategies do not yield the desired results our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

the implementation of our turnaround plan may intensify the risks we face and may not be successful in driving improved performance 

our turnaround plan includes restructuring market segments optimizing restaurant ownership mix through accelerated refranchising delivering cost savings and enhancing financial value through increased leverage implementing those actions will intensify the existing risks we face in our business including risks associated with franchising and risks associated with our credit ratings further if those actions are not successful take longer to complete than initially projected or are not executed effectively our business operations financial results and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we face intense competition in our markets which could hurt our business 

we compete primarily in the “informal eating out” ieo segment which is highly competitive we are facing sustained intense competition from both traditional and other competitors which include many nontraditional market participants such as convenience stores and coffee shops in addition in recent periods we have experienced emerging and growing competition from the fast casual category of restaurants we expect our environment to continue to be highly competitive and in any particular reporting period our results may be impacted by new actions of our competitors which may have a short or longterm impact on our results 

we compete on the basis of product choice quality affordability service and location in particular we believe our ability to compete successfully in the current market environment depends on our ability to improve existing products develop new products price our products appropriately manage the complexity of our restaurant operations and respond effectively to our 

  

mcdonalds corporation 2015 annual report 3 

competitors’ actions recognizing these dependencies we have intensified our focus in recent periods on strategies to achieve these goals including the turnaround plan described above and we will likely continue to modify our strategies and implement new strategies in the future there can be no assurance these strategies will be effective and some strategies may be effective at improving some metrics while adversely affecting other metrics 

if we do not anticipate and address evolving consumer preferences our business could suffer 

our continued success depends on our system’s ability to anticipate and respond effectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics trends in food sourcing food preparation and consumer preferences in the ieo segment we must continuously adapt to deliver a relevant experience for our customers amidst a highly competitive valuedriven operating environment we continue to implement initiatives to address these shifts at an aggressive pace there is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful and if they are not our financial results could be adversely impacted 

if our pricing promotional and marketing plans are not effective our results may be negatively impacted 

our results depend on the impact of our pricing promotional and marketing plans and our system’s ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly to economic and competitive conditions our existing or future pricing strategies and the value proposition they represent will continue to be important components of our overall plan may not be successful and could negatively impact sales and margins the promotion of our menu offerings may yield results below desired levels 

additionally we operate in an increasingly complex and costly advertising environment our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful and we may fail to attract and retain customers we have increased our emphasis on digital offerings and customer loyalty initiatives and our success depends in part on whether we can effectively execute such offerings and initiatives in a way that will enhance customer engagement if our pricing promotional and marketing plans are not successful or are not as successful as those of our competitors our sales guest counts and market share could decrease 

failure to preserve the value and relevance of our brand could have a negative impact on our financial results 

to be successful in the future we believe we must preserve enhance and leverage the value of our brand brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of factors including the nutritional content and preparation of our food our business practices and the manner in which we source the commodities we use consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons for example nutritional health and other scientific studies and conclusions which constantly evolve and often have contradictory implications drive popular opinion litigation and regulation including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior in ways that affect the ieo segment or perceptions of our brand and could be material to our business perceptions may also be affected by third parties presenting or promoting adverse commentary or perceptions of the quickservice category of the ieo segment our brand andor our operations our suppliers or our franchisees if we are unsuccessful in addressing such adverse commentary or perceptions our brand and our financial results may suffer 

additionally the ongoing relevance of our brand may depend on the success of our sustainability initiatives to support our brand ambition of good food good people and good neighbor which will require systemwide coordination and alignment if we are not effective in achieving our stated sustainability goals and 

 

addressing these and other matters of social responsibility in a way that inspires trust and confidence trust in our brand could suffer in particular business incidents that erode consumer trust particularly if such incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results 

unfavorable general economic conditions could adversely affect our business and financial results 

our results of operations are substantially affected by economic conditions which can vary significantly by market and can impact consumer disposable income levels and spending habits economic conditions can also be impacted by a variety of factors including hostilities epidemics and actions taken by governments to manage national economic matters whether through austerity or stimulus measures and initiatives intended to control wages unemployment credit availability inflation taxation and other economic drivers many major economies both advanced and developing continue to face weak economies high unemployment rates and other ongoing economic issues continued adverse economic conditions or adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets could pressure our operating performance and our business and financial results may suffer 

supply chain interruptions may increase costs or reduce revenues 

we depend on the effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure reliable and sufficient product supply including on favorable terms the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers in countries around the world supply chain interruptions including due to lack of supply or price increases can adversely affect us or the suppliers and franchisees that are also part of our system and whose performance has a significant impact on our results such shortages or disruptions could be caused by factors beyond the control of our suppliers or us including inclement weather natural disasters increased demand problems in production or distribution disruptions in third party logistics or transportation systems the inability of our suppliers to obtain credit or food safety warnings or advisories if we experience interruptions in our supply chain our costs could increase and it could limit the availability of products critical to our operations 

food safety concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

our ability to increase sales and profits depends on our system’s ability to meet expectations for safe food and on our ability to manage the potential impact on mcdonald’s of foodborne illnesses and food or product safety issues that may arise in the future food safety is a top priority and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe food products however food safety events including instances of foodborne illness have occurred in the food industry in the past and could occur in the future in 2014 food quality issues were discovered at a supplier to mcdonald’s and other food companies in china as a consequence of this issue results in china japan and certain other markets were negatively impacted due to lost sales and profitability including expenses associated with rebuilding customer trust any future instances of food tampering food contamination or foodborne illness whether actual or perceived could adversely affect our brand and reputation as well as our revenues and profits 

our franchise business model presents a number of risks 

our success relies in part on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees yet we have limited influence over their operations our restaurant margins arise from two sources 

4     mcdonalds corporation 2015 annual report 

companyoperated restaurants and franchised restaurants our franchisees manage their businesses independently and therefore are responsible for the daytoday operation of their restaurants the revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales our franchisees may not experience sales growth and our revenues and margins could be negatively affected as a result if sales trends worsen for franchisees their financial results may deteriorate which could result in among other things restaurant closures or delayed or reduced payments to us our refranchising effort will increase that dependence and the effect of those factors 

our success also depends on the willingness and ability of our independent franchisees to implement major initiatives which may include financial investment and to remain aligned with us on operating promotional and capitalintensive reinvestment plans the ability of our franchisees to contribute to the achievement of our plans is dependent in large part on the availability of funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general or by the creditworthiness of our franchisees or the company our operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety or other operational problems or project a brand image inconsistent with our values particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited costly to exercise or subject to litigation if franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards the brand’s image and reputation could be harmed which in turn could hurt our business and operating results 

our ownership mix also affects our results and financial condition the decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex and changing our ability to achieve the benefits of our refranchising strategy which involves a shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants in a timely manner or at all will depend on various factors including our ability to timely and effectively identify franchisees that meet our rigorous standards the performance of our existing franchisees whether the resulting ownership mix supports our financial objectives and our ability to manage risks associated with our refranchising strategy 

changes in commodity and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

the profitability of our companyoperated restaurants depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs including food paper supply fuel utilities distribution and other operating costs any volatility in certain commodity prices could adversely affect our operating results by impacting restaurant profitability the commodity market for some of the ingredients we use such as beef and chicken is particularly volatile and is subject to significant price fluctuations due to seasonal shifts climate conditions industry demand international commodity markets food safety concerns product recalls government regulation and other factors all of which are beyond our control and in many instances unpredictable we can only partially address future price risk through hedging and other activities and therefore increases in commodity costs could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

the global scope of our business subjects us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

we face differing cultural regulatory and economic environments that exist within and among the more than 100 countries where mcdonald’s restaurants operate and our ability to achieve our business objectives depends on our success in these environments meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment and our 

 

global success is partially dependent on our system’s ability to leverage operating successes across markets our initiatives may not have broad appeal with our customer base and could drive unanticipated changes in customer perceptions and guest counts 

disruptions in our operations or price volatility in a market can also result from governmental actions such as price foreign exchange or importexport controls increased tariffs governmentmandated closure of our or our suppliers’ operations and asset seizures the cost and disruption of responding to governmental investigations or actions whether or not they have merit may impact our results our international success depends in part on the effectiveness of our strategies and brandbuilding initiatives to reduce our exposure to such governmental actions our results of operations and financial condition are also affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may adversely affect reported earnings 

additionally we face challenges and uncertainties associated with operating in developing markets which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability economic volatility crime corruption and social and ethnic unrest such challenges are exacerbated in many cases by a lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainties in how local law is applied and enforced including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment if we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with our international operations it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

challenges with respect to talent management could harm our business 

our success depends in part on our system’s ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel to work in our restaurants increased costs associated with recruiting and retaining such qualified personnel whether because of the trend toward higher statutory minimum wages and social expenses or because of voluntary increases in wages necessitated by labor market conditions could have a negative impact on the margins of our companyoperated restaurants additionally economic action such as boycotts protests work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations could adversely affect including the ability to recruit and retain talent us or the franchisees and suppliers that are also part of the mcdonald’s system and whose performance may have a material impact on our results 

we are also impacted by the costs and other effects of compliance with us and international regulations affecting our workforce which includes our staff and employees working in our companyoperated restaurants these regulations are increasingly focused on employment issues including wage and hour healthcare immigration retirement and other employee benefits and unlawful workplace discrimination our potential exposure to reputational and other harm regarding our workplace practices or conditions or those of our independent franchisees or suppliers or perceptions thereof could have a negative impact on our business 

information technology system failures or interruptions or breaches of network security may interrupt our operations 

we are increasingly reliant on technological systems eg pointofsale and other instore systems or platforms to conduct our business including technologyenabled solutions provided to us by third parties and any failure of these systems could significantly impact our operations and customer perceptions despite the implementation of security measures those technology systems and solutions could become vulnerable to damage disability or failures due to theft fire power loss telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events the third 

  

mcdonalds corporation 2015 annual report 5 

party solutions also present the risks faced by the third party’s business if those systems or solutions were to fail or otherwise be unavailable and we were unable to recover in a timely way we could experience an interruption in our operations we may also not fully realize the benefits of the significant investments we are making to enhance the customer experience through digital engagement and social media furthermore security breaches involving our systems or those of third party providers may occur such as unauthorized access denial of service computer viruses and other disruptive problems caused by hackers our information technology systems contain personal financial and other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees as well as financial proprietary and other confidential information related to our business an actual or alleged security breach could result in system disruptions shutdowns theft or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information the occurrence of any of these incidents could result in adverse publicity loss of consumer confidence reduced sales and profits and criminal penalties or civil liabilities 

increasing regulatory complexity may adversely affect restaurant operations and our financial results 

our regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance and similar risks that could affect our operations and results in material ways in many of our markets including the united states and countries in europe we are subject to increasing regulation which has increased our cost of doing business we are affected by the cost compliance and other risks associated with the often conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations we face including where inconsistent standards imposed by multiple governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings 

our success depends in part on our ability to manage the impact of new potential or changing regulations that can affect our business plans these regulations may relate to among others product packaging marketing and the nutritional content and safety of our food and other products labeling and other disclosure practices ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from thirdparty suppliers particularly given varying requirements and practices for testing and disclosure 

additionally we are keenly aware of and working to manage the risks and costs to us our franchisees and our supply chain of the effects of climate change greenhouse gases energy and water resources the increased public focus including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations on these and other environmental sustainability matters eg packaging and waste animal health and welfare deforestation and land use and the increased pressure to make commitments set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them could expose us to market operational and execution costs or risks if we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with our complex regulatory environment it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

we are subject to increasing legal complexity and could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us 

increasing legal complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways we could be subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business including class actions administrative proceedings government investigations employment and personal injury claims landlordtenant disputes disputes with current or former suppliers claims by current or former franchisees and intellectual property claims including claims that we infringed another party’s trademarks 

 

copyrights or patents inconsistent standards imposed by governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation 

litigation involving our relationship with franchisees and the legal distinction between our franchisees and us for employment law purposes if determined adversely could increase costs negatively impact the business prospects of our franchisees and subject us to incremental liability for their actions similarly although our commercial relationships with our suppliers remain independent there may be attempts to challenge that independence which if determined adversely could also increase costs negatively impact the business prospects of our suppliers and subject us to incremental liability for their actions we are also subject to the legal and compliance risks associated with privacy data collection protection and management in particular as it relates to information we collect when we provide optional technologyrelated services to franchisees 

our operating results could also be affected by the following 

 a judgment significantly in excess of any applicable insurance coverage could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations further adverse publicity resulting from these claims may hurt our business 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately ensure that we are not infringing the intellectual property of others which could harm the value of the mcdonald’s brand and our business 

the success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights service marks trade secrets patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products we also license our intellectual property to franchisees and other third parties and we cannot assure you that they will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property 

we have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions the trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the united states in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the united states and foreign countries may not be adequate in addition the steps we have taken may not adequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future in particular we may be involved in intellectual property claims including often aggressive or opportunistic attempts to enforce patents used in information technology systems which might affect our operations and results any claim of infringement whether or not it has merit could be 

6     mcdonalds corporation 2015 annual report 

timeconsuming could result in costly litigation and could harm our business 

changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and foreign jurisdictions and our operations plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives around the world in particular we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or related authoritative interpretations particularly if corporate tax reform becomes a key component of budgetary initiatives in the united states and elsewhere we are also impacted by settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by the irs or other taxing authorities in connection with our tax audits all of which will depend on their timing nature and scope any increases in income tax rates changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

changes in accounting standards or the recognition of impairment or other charges may adversely affect our future operations and results 

new accounting standards or changes in financial reporting requirements accounting principles or practices including with respect to our critical accounting estimates could adversely affect our future results we may also be affected by the nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets including decisions that result in impairment or other charges that reduce our earnings in assessing the recoverability of our longlived assets we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors these estimates are highly subjective and can be significantly impacted by many factors such as global and local business and economic conditions operating costs inflation competition and consumer and demographic trends if our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges if we experience any such changes they could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results for the affected periods 

a decrease in our credit ratings or an increase in our funding costs could adversely affect our profitability 

we may be negatively affected by the impact of changes in our debt levels or our results of operations on our credit ratings interest expense availability of acceptable counterparties ability to obtain funding on favorable terms or our operating or financial flexibility especially if lenders impose new operating or financial covenants in particular our credit rating was lowered as a result of our decision to increase our leverage and the pace of the return of cash to our shareholders 

our operations may also be impacted by regulations affecting capital flows financial markets or financial institutions which can limit our ability to manage and deploy our liquidity or increase our funding costs if any of these events were to occur they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

trading volatility and price of our common stock may be adversely affected by many factors 

many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects the most important of these factors some of which are outside our control are the following 



 

 our results and prospects can be adversely affected by events such as severe weather conditions natural disasters hostilities and social unrest among others 

severe weather conditions natural disasters hostilities and social unrest terrorist activities health epidemics or pandemics or expectations about them can adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels or other factors that affect our results and prospects such as commodity costs our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to certain of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully

10     mcdonalds corporation 2015 annual report 



at least annually we consider which companies comprise a readily identifiable investment peer group mcdonalds is included in published restaurant indices however unlike most other companies included in these indices which have no or limited international operations mcdonalds does business in more than 100 countries and a substantial portion of our revenues and income is generated outside the us in addition because of our size mcdonalds inclusion in those indices tends to skew the results therefore we believe that such a comparison is not meaningful 

our market capitalization trading volume and importance in an industry that is vital to the us economy have resulted in mcdonalds inclusion in the dow jones industrial average djia since 1985 like mcdonalds many djia companies generate meaningful revenues and income outside the us and some manage global brands thus we believe that the use of the djia companies as the group for comparison purposes is appropriate 

the following performance graph shows mcdonalds cumulative total shareholder returns ie price appreciation and reinvestment of dividends relative to the standard  poors 500 stock index sp 500 index and to the djia companies for the fiveyear period ended december 31 2015  the graph assumes that the value of an investment in mcdonalds common stock the sp 500 index and the djia companies including mcdonalds was 100 at december 31 2010  for the djia companies returns are weighted for market capitalization as of the beginning of each period indicated these returns may vary from those of the dow jones industrial average index which is not weighted by market capitalization and may be composed of different companies during the period under consideration

 strategic direction and financial performance 

the strength of the alignment among the company its franchisees and suppliers collectively referred to as the system has been key to mcdonalds longterm success by leveraging the system mcdonald’s is able to identify implement and scale ideas that meet customers changing needs and preferences in addition the company’s business model enables the system to consistently deliver locallyrelevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities it serves 

in 2015 the company and its board of directors took steps to reset its business and restore growth which included the election of a new ceo in the first quarter in may management announced the initial steps of the companys turnaround plan beginning with a worldwide restructuring in july this resulted in a reorganization from a geographicallyfocused structure to segments that combine markets with similar characteristics and opportunities for growth this new operating structure is designed to sharpen the companys focus on the customer drive greater accountability and remove distractions and bureaucracy management expects the new structure to enable faster decisionmaking and an increased ability to move proven initiatives quickly across markets 

the system is focused on the fundamentals of running great restaurants by providing customers with what matters most to them  hot and fresh food fast and friendly service and a contemporary restaurant experience at the value of mcdonald’s in addition mcdonald’s is building on its competitive advantages of convenience scale geographic diversification and system alignment that have been created over time 

mcdonald’s aspires to be viewed by its customers as a modern and progressive burger company delivering a contemporary customer experience the priorities of the turnaround plan are threefold drive operational growth create brand excitement and enhance financial value 

to drive operational growth the company is working to enhance the quality choice and variety of its menu in addition the company is building upon investments it has already made in reimaging and technology to innovate the way customers can order and how they are served which represent elements of the experience of the future while execution and timing of these elements may be different in each market experience of the future is designed to fundamentally enhance mcdonalds relationship with customers and their experience with the brand 

the company’s brand efforts aim to reach customers in ways that drive greater excitement and are meaningful to them such as fun engaging marketing campaigns and focused support of communities enhancements to the quality of mcdonalds menu more local sourcing of ingredients and commitments around sustainability efforts are all designed to improve consumer confidence in the brand 

the modifications to mcdonald’s operating approach are accompanied by strategies to enhance financial value in 2015 management announced plans to optimize the company’s restaurant ownership mix by refranchising about 4000 restaurants through 2018 deliver net annual ga savings of about 500 million the vast majority of which is expected to be realized by the 

 

end of 2017 and return about 30 billion to shareholders for the threeyear period ending 2016 

mcdonald’s maintains a strong financial foundation supported by industryleading unit volumes that enable the company to pursue growth through business and economic cycles while returning significant amounts of cash to shareholders each year cash from operations benefits from a heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income received from franchisees provides a stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs and enables coinvestment either through capital expenditures or rent incentives with franchisees on key initiatives such as reimaging in addition the franchise business model is less capital intensive as franchisees invest in the costs of going into business and most future reinvestment 

the company’s substantial cash flow strong investment grade credit rating and continued access to credit provides mcdonald’s flexibility to fund capital expenditures as well as return cash to shareholders after a thorough evaluation of financial opportunities management announced plans to optimize the company’s capital structure and increased the cash return to shareholders target to about 30 billion for the threeyear period ending 2016  a 10 billion increase over the previous target with incremental debt funding the vast majority of the increase this proactive move in the company’s leverage metrics and credit ratings still enables mcdonald’s to efficiently and cost effectively access capital globally while allowing for continued investment in the business these actions together with the decision of the board of directors to raise the dividend in 2015 reflect the board and management’s confidence in mcdonalds future 

the company’s financial results for 2015 reflect two distinct performance periods during the first half of the year the company took bold and urgent action to reset the business and refocus the system on its customers however operating performance was weak the second half of the year was about execution with results turning positive and providing tangible evidence that the turnaround plan is working 

in mcdonald’s heavily franchised business model growing comparable sales is important to increasing operating income and returns global comparable sales increased 15 in 2015 driven by positive performance across all segments in the third and fourth quarters consolidated guest counts were negative for the year 

us comparable sales increased 05 and comparable guest counts declined 30 though performance improved sequentially throughout the year with positive comparable sales in the third and fourth quarters 

comparable sales in the international lead markets grew 34 and comparable guest counts increased 10 all major markets contributed to the positive comparable sales performance except france which was impacted by macroeconomic headwinds 

in the high growth markets comparable sales increased 18 and comparable guest counts declined 22 the increase in comparable sales was driven primarily by solid performance in china as the market successfully executed strong recovery plans following the prior year supplier issue   

comparable sales in the foundational markets increased 07 and comparable guest counts declined 37 solid performance in many markets across asia europe latin america and the middle east were offset by negative comparable sales and guest counts in japan

artisan grilled chicken and premium buttermilk crispy chicken deluxe sandwiches the october launch of all day breakfast built on the positive momentum experienced during the third quarter mcdonald’s ability to move from one test market in april to a national launch in october in over 13000 restaurants is a testament to the cultural changes the company is making to become more relevant to customers

while changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results mcdonald’s mitigates exposures where practical by purchasing goods and services in local currencies financing in local currencies and hedging certain foreigndenominated cash flows 

foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results in each of the last three years in 2015 results were negatively impacted by the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro australian dollar russian ruble and most other currencies   in 2014 results were negatively impacted by the weaker russian ruble australian dollar and certain other currencies partly offset by the stronger british pound in 2013 results were negatively impacted by the weaker australian dollar japanese yen and many other foreign currencies partly offset by the stronger euro

net income and diluted earnings per common share 

in 2015  net income decreased   5  increased 5  in constant currencies to 45 billion  and diluted earnings per common share was flat increased 10  in constant currencies at 480  foreign currency translation had a negative impact of 050  on diluted earnings per share

results in 2015 benefited from higher franchised margins and a gain on sale of property in the us partly offset by strategic charges primarily related to goodwill impairment and other asset 

 

writeoffs in conjunction with the companys refranchising initiatives restructuring and incremental restaurant closings the strategic charges and gain on sale of property in the us had a negative net impact on diluted earnings per share of 018 in 2015 

results in 2014 were negatively impacted by the following items that had a negative impact of 054 on diluted earnings per share

 excluding the impact of these current and prior year items in 2015 earnings per share in constant currencies would have reflected an increase of 012 or 2 in 2014 diluted earnings per share would have reflected a decrease of 3 1 in constant currencies excluding the 2014 charges related to certain foreign 

 

tax matters and the china supplier issue this supplemental information is provided to assist investors in understanding the impact of significant items outside of normal operations 

the company repurchased 618 million  shares of its stock for 62 billion  in 2015  and 331 million  shares of its stock for 32 billion  in 2014  driving reductions in weightedaverage shares outstanding on a diluted basis in both periods which positively benefited earnings per share 



revenues 

the company’s revenues consist of sales by companyoperated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales minimum rent payments and initial fees revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales and generally include initial fees 

the company is accelerating the pace of refranchising to optimize its restaurant ownership mix generate more stable and predictable revenue and cash flow streams and operate with a less resourceintensive structure the shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants negatively impacts consolidated revenues as companyoperated sales are replaced by franchised sales where the company receives rent andor royalty revenue based on a percentage of sales 

in 2015  constant currency revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales and the benefit from expansion in 2014 constant currency revenue was flat compared to the prior year reflecting the impact of negative comparable sales partially offset by expansion

franchised margins 

franchised margin dollars represent revenues from franchised restaurants less the company’s occupancy costs rent and depreciation associated with those sites franchised margin dollars represented about 70 of the combined restaurant margins in 2015  2014  and 2013  

in 2015 franchised margin dollars decreased   297 million  or 4  increased 4  in constant currencies the constant currency increase was due to positive comparable sales performance expansion and refranchising in 2014 franchised margin dollars decreased 32 million  or 0  increased 1  in constant currencies reflecting a benefit from expansion and refranchising offset by negative comparable sales performance 

in connection with the companys longterm financial targets the company plans to refranchise about 4000 restaurants for the fouryear period ending 2018 while this refranchising activity may have a dilutive effect on the franchised margin percent it typically results in higher franchised margin dollars 

franchised margins 





 

 the franchised margin percent in foundational markets  corporate is higher relative to the other segments due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed andor affiliated restaurants where the company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs 

companyoperated margins 

companyoperated margin dollars represent sales by companyoperated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants in 2 015   companyoperated margin dollars decreased   370 million  or 13   1  in constant currencies in 2014  companyoperated margin dollars decreased 415 million  or 13   11  in constant currencies reflecting weak results across all segments

selling general  administrative expenses 

consolidated selling general and administrative expenses decreased   2  increased 4  in constant currencies in 2015  and increased 4 5 in constant currencies in 2014 the constant currency increase in 2015 was due to higher incentivebased compensation costs reflecting improved performance partly offset by lower employeerelated costs resulting from the companys recent restructuring initiatives the increase in 2014 was primarily due to higher employee and other costs the 2014 winter olympics and the worldwide owneroperator convention partly offset by a reduction in incentivebased compensation 

selling general  administrative expenses 



 selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues was 96  in 2015  91  in 2014  and 85  in 2013  selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales was 29  in 2015  28  in 2014  and 27  in 2013  management believes that analyzing selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales as well as revenues is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support the overall mcdonalds business 

as a result of the recategorization of all markets from the prior geographic segments into the new segments historical market support expenses outside the us were reallocated from the prior geographic segments into the new international segments for all periods presented beginning july 1 2015 the company centralized certain market support expenses previously incurred by the geographic segments into corporate as a result these expenses were included in the segment results prior to july 1 2015 and in corporate results subsequent to that date

 equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased in 2015 and 2014 primarily due to weaker results in japan including the decision to close underperforming restaurants in 2015 and the supplier issue in 2014 

 

 in 2015 results included a 135 million gain on the sale of property in the us mostly offset by asset writeoffs resulting from the decision to close underperforming restaurants primarily in the us and china in 2014 the increase in asset dispositions and other expense was primarily due to higher asset writeoffs and lower other income items in the us 

 in 2015 the company recorded strategic charges related to goodwill and other asset writeoffs in conjunction with its refranchising initiative in certain foundational markets and global restructuring activities in 2014 impairment and other charges primarily reflected certain costs associated with the supplier issue in china

provision for income taxes 

in 2015  2014  and 2013  the reported effective income tax rates were 309  355  and 319 respectively 

in 2014 the higher effective income tax rate was primarily due to a change in tax reserves for 20032010 resulting from an unfavorable lower tax court ruling in a foreign tax jurisdiction as well as the impact of changes in tax reserves related to audit progression in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions these items had a negative impact of 41 on the effective tax rate 

in 2013 the effective income tax rate included a tax benefit of nearly 50 million reflecting the retroactive impact of certain tax benefits as a result of the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 

consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets net of valuation allowance of 18 billion  in 2015  and 16 billion  in 2014  substantially all of the net tax assets are expected to be realized in the us and other profitable markets

the new standard allows for either a full retrospective or modified retrospective transition approach the company does not believe that the standard will impact its recognition of revenue from companyoperated restaurants or its recognition of royalties from restaurants operated by franchisees or licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees which are based on a percent of sales the company is continuing to evaluate the impact the adoption of this standard will have on the recognition of other less significant revenue transactions such as initial fees from franchisees for new restaurant openings or new franchise terms

operating income is used to compute return on average assets while net income is used to calculate return on average common equity monthend balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity 

returns on assets and equity 



in 2015 return on average assets decreased primarily due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation on operating income partly offset by lower average assets while return on average common equity increased primarily due to lower average common equity as a result of higher treasury stock purchases in 2014 return on average assets and return on average common equity decreased reflecting lower operating results operating income does not include interest income however cash balances are included in average assets the inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by about two percentage points for all years presented 

financing and market risk 

the company generally borrows on a longterm basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations debt obligations at december 31 2015 totaled 241 billion compared with 150 billion at december 31 2014 the net increase in 2015 was primarily due to net longterm issuances of 97 billion in connection with the companys plans to optimize its capital structure

standard  poor’s and moody’s currently rate with a stable outlook the company’s commercial paper a2 and p2 respectively and its longterm debt bbb and baa1 respectively to access the debt capital markets the company relies on creditrating agencies to assign shortterm and longterm credit ratings 

certain of the company’s debt obligations contain crossacceleration provisions and restrictions on company and subsidiary mortgages and the longterm debt of certain subsidiaries there are no provisions in the company’s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the company’s business under existing authorization from the company’s board of directors at december 31 2015 the company had 40 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds including through i public or private offering of debt securities ii direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions and iii other forms of indebtedness in addition to debt securities available through a mediumterm notes program registered with the us securities and exchange commission sec and a global mediumterm notes program the company has 25 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the us and global markets see debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements debt maturing in 2016 is 787 million of longterm corporate debt the company plans to issue longterm debt to refinance this maturing debt as of december 31 2015 the companys subsidiaries also had 732 million of borrowings outstanding primarily under uncommitted foreign currency line of credit agreements 

the company uses major capital markets bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense the company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring redeeming and repurchasing debt terminating swaps and using derivatives the company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes all swaps are overthecounter instruments 

in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations the company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated the company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties intercompany financings and longterm investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates this reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders’ equity total foreign currencydenominated debt was 70 billion and 59 billion for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively in addition where practical the company’s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges see the summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives

the company’s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies the company’s largest net asset exposures defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities at year end were as follows 

foreign currency net asset exposures 



the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the company’s results of operations cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments the interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10 in the same direction relative to the us dollar on all financial instruments however the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets based on the results of these analyses of the company’s financial instruments neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2015 levels nor a 10 adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2015 levels would materially affect the company’s results of operations cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments 

liquidity 

the company has significant operations outside the us where we earn about 60 of our operating income a significant portion of these historical earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the company has made and will continue to make substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations accordingly no us federal or state income taxes have been provided on these undistributed foreign earnings the companys cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately 15 billion as of december 31 2015  we do not intend nor do we foresee a need to repatriate these funds 

consistent with prior years we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents domestic cash flows from operations annual repatriation of a portion of the current periods foreign earnings and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating investing and financing activities we also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating investing and financing activities 

in the future should we require more capital to fund activities in the us than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods earnings from foreign jurisdictions this could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the future 

while the likelihood is remote to the extent foreign cash is available the company could also elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise the company may be subject to additional us income taxes net of an adjustment for foreign

tax credits which could result in a use of cash this could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the period in which such a determination is made to repatriate prior period foreign earnings refer to the income taxes note to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to our income taxes and the undistributed earnings of the companys foreign subsidiaries 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the company has longterm contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations related to both companyoperated and franchised restaurants and debt obligations in addition the company has longterm revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements cash provided by operations including cash provided by these franchise arrangements along with the company’s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations the following table summarizes the company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the company under existing franchise arrangements as of december 31 2015  see discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

 in the us the company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to i make taxdeferred contributions and ii receive companyprovided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of internal revenue service irs limitations at december 31 2015  total liabilities for the supplemental plans were 488 million  

in addition total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were 781 million  at december 31 2015  

there are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction inventory energy marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business the amounts related to these commitments are not significant to the company’s financial position such commitments are generally shorter term in nature and will be funded from operating cash flows 



critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its 

 

estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates 

the company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

 property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straightline basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets taking into account anticipated technological or other changes the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors economic factors and industry trends if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or writeoffs in future periods 

 the company has a sharebased compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equitybased incentives including stock options and restricted stock units rsus to employees and nonemployee directors the expense for these equitybased incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period 

the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closedform pricing model the pricing model requires assumptions which impact the assumed fair value including the expected life of the stock option the riskfree interest rate expected volatility of the company’s stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield the company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants sharebased compensation expense will fluctuate in future years the fair value of each rsu granted is equal to the market price of the company’s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period 

 longlived assets including goodwill are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in assessing the recoverability of the company’s longlived assets the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the company’s experience and knowledge of its operations these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions operating costs inflation competition and consumer and demographic trends a key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales if the company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future the company may be required to record impairment charges based on the annual goodwill impairment test conducted in the fourth quarter approximately 510 of goodwill may be at risk of future impairment as the fair values of certain reporting units were not substantially in excess of their carrying amounts 

26     mcdonalds corporation 2015 annual report 

 in the ordinary course of business the company is subject to proceedings lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors customers employees franchisees government agencies intellectual property shareholders and suppliers the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses a determination of the amount of accrual required if any for these contingencies is made after 

careful analysis of each matter the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters the company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 

 the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies including the sale of appreciated assets in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if these estimates and assumptions change in the future the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance this could result in a charge to or an increase in income in the period such determination is made 

the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 

in 2015 the company decreased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits related to settlements with taxing authorities by 258 million in 2014 the company increased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken in prior years by 505 million most of which came from foreignrelated tax matters after considering the impact of deferred tax offsets interest and penalties these foreignrelated tax matters negatively impacted the effective tax rate by 41 see the income taxes footnote in the consolidated financial statements for the related tax reconciliations the most significant new developments in 2014 and 2015 are described below 

in 2014 the company received an unfavorable lower tax court ruling in a foreign tax jurisdiction related to exempt income matters as a result of this new information the company changed its judgment on the sustainability of this tax position for 20032010 and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits of 188 million in 2015 the company received an unfavorable decision related to its procedural efforts to appeal the 2014 unfavorable lower tax court ruling as a result of this new information the company agreed to settle the issue for 20032008 with the tax authorities and the unrecognized tax benefits were reduced by 143 million no cash payment was made related to this settlement in 2015 as the company had previously made a payment to the taxing authority the settlement did not have a material impact on the companys cash flows results of operations or financial position 

in 2014 the internal revenue service “irs” concluded its field examination of the company’s us federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010 in connection with this examination the company agreed to certain adjustments proposed by the irs the liabilities previously recorded related to these adjustments were adequate in early 2015 the irs issued a revenue agent report for these agreed adjustments and the balance of unrecognized tax benefits was reduced by 102 million 

 

also in 2014 in connection with the irs examination of 20092010 the company received notices of proposed adjustments related to certain transfer pricing matters and engaged in audit defense discussions with the irs as a result of this new information in 2014 the company changed its judgment on the measurement of the related unrecognized tax benefits and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits of 38 million the company disagrees with these proposed adjustments and filed a protest with the irs appeals office in 2015 the company expects resolution on these issues in either 2016 or 2017 

in 2014 the company received new information from tax authorities during the progression of tax audits in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions including the receipt of proposed tax assessments primarily related to transfer pricing matters as a result of this new information the company changed its judgment on the measurement of the related unrecognized tax benefits and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits of 207 million the company settled certain of these tax audits in 2014 and plans to defend its position with the tax authorities on the remaining audits in 2015 there was no significant progression on these audits 

in december 2015 the european commission opened a formal investigation directly with the luxembourg government to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with european union rules on state aid if this matter is adversely resolved luxembourg may be required to assess and the company may be required to pay additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase 

while the company cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the aforementioned tax matters we believe that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined in accordance with topic 740  income taxes of the accounting standards codification “asc” 

deferred us income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling 149 billion  related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates the temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the us if managements intentions change in the future deferred taxes may need to be provided 

effects of changing prices—inflation 

the company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively this ability is because of rapid inventory turnover the ability to adjust menu prices cost controls and substantial property holdings many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation

reconciliation of returns on incremental invested capital 

roiic is a measure reviewed by management over oneyear and threeyear time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of our markets the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital this measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation the numerator is the company’s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period 

the denominator is the weightedaverage cash used for investing activities during the applicable oneor threeyear period the weightedaverage cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis these weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter’s investing activities to incremental operating income for example fourth quarter 2015  investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income 125 of fourth quarter 2015  investing activities are included in the oneyear and threeyear calculations in contrast fourth quarter 2014  is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago and therefore have a fullyear impact on 2015  operating income with little or no impact to the base period 875 and 1000 of fourth quarter 2014  investing activities are included in the oneyear and threeyear calculations respectively cash used for investing activities can vary significantly by quarter resulting in a weightedaverage that may be higher or lower than the simple average of the periods presented management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average 

the reconciliations to the most comparable measurements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us for the numerator and denominator of the oneyear and threeyear roiic are as follows

c narrative description of business 

 the company operates and franchises mcdonald’s restaurants which serve a locallyrelevant menu of quality food and drinks sold at various affordable price points in more than 100 countries mcdonald’s global system is comprised of both companyowned and franchised restaurants mcdonald’s franchised restaurants are owned and operated under one of the following structures  conventional franchise developmental license or affiliate the optimal ownership structure for an individual restaurant trading area or market country is based on a variety of factors including the availability of individuals with the entrepreneurial experience and financial resources as well as the local legal and regulatory environment in critical areas such as property ownership and franchising we continually review and as appropriate adjust our mix of companyowned and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance the business relationship between mcdonald’s and its independent franchisees is of fundamental importance to overall performance and to the mcdonald’s brand this business relationship is supported by an agreement that requires adherence to standards and policies essential to protecting our brand 

the company views itself primarily as a franchisor with the vast majority of mcdonald’s restaurants approximately 80 owned and operated by independent franchisees franchising enables an individual to own a restaurant business and maintain control over personnel purchasing marketing and pricing decisions while also benefiting from the strength of mcdonald’s global brand operating system and financial resources one of the strengths of this model is that the expertise gained from operating companyowned restaurants allows mcdonald’s to improve the operations and success of all restaurants while innovations from franchisees can be tested and when viable efficiently implemented across relevant restaurants 

directly operating mcdonald’s restaurants contributes significantly to our ability to act as a credible franchisor having companyowned restaurants is essential to providing company personnel with a venue for restaurant operations training experience in addition in our companyowned and operated restaurants and in collaboration with franchisees we are able to further develop and refine operating standards marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies that will ultimately benefit relevant mcdonald’s restaurants 

under a conventional franchise arrangement the company owns the land and building or secures a longterm lease for the restaurant location and the franchisee pays for equipment signs 

 

seating and décor the company believes that ownership of real estate combined with the coinvestment by franchisees enables us to achieve restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry 

franchisees are also responsible for reinvesting capital in their businesses over time in addition to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives the company frequently coinvests with franchisees to fund improvements to their restaurants or their operating systems these investments developed with input from mcdonald’s with the aim of improving local business performance increase the value of our brand through the development of modernized more attractive and higher revenue generating restaurants 

the company’s typical franchise term is 20 years the company requires franchisees to meet rigorous standards and generally does not work with passive investors the business relationship with franchisees is designed to assure consistency and high quality at all mcdonald’s restaurants conventional franchisees contribute to the company’s revenue through the payment of rent and royalties based upon a percent of sales with specified minimum rent payments along with initial fees paid upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new franchise this structure enables mcdonald’s to generate significant levels of cash flow 

under a developmental license arrangement licensees provide capital for the entire business including the real estate interest the company does not invest any capital under a developmental license arrangement the company receives a royalty based upon a percent of sales as well as initial fees upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new license we use the developmental license ownership structure in over 70 countries with a total of 5228 restaurants the largest developmental licensee operates approximately 2100  restaurants in 19  countries in latin america and the caribbean 

finally the company also has an equity investment in a limited number of foreign affiliated markets referred to as “affiliates” in these markets the company receives a royalty based on a percent of sales and records its share of net results in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates the largest of these affiliates is japan where there are nearly 3100  restaurants 

  

 the company and its franchisees purchase food packaging equipment and other goods from numerous independent suppliers the company has established and enforces high quality standards and product specifications the company has quality centers around the world designed to ensure that its high standards are consistently met the quality assurance process not only involves ongoing product reviews but also onsite supplier visits a quality leadership board composed of the company’s technical safety and supply chain specialists provides strategic global leadership for all aspects of food quality and safety in addition the company works closely with suppliers to encourage innovation assure best practices and drive continuous improvement leveraging scale supply chain infrastructure and risk management strategies the company also collaborates with suppliers toward a goal of achieving competitive predictable food and paper costs over the long term

 the company’s business is not dependent upon either a single customer or small group of customers 

  

 companyoperated restaurants have no backlog orders 

  

 no material portion of the business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the us government 

  

 mcdonald’s restaurants compete with international national regional and local retailers of food products the company 

 

competes on the basis of price convenience service menu variety and product quality in a highly fragmented global restaurant industry 

in measuring the company’s competitive position management reviews data compiled by euromonitor international a leading source of market data with respect to the global restaurant industry the company’s primary competition which management refers to as the informal eating out ieo segment includes the following restaurant categories defined by euromonitor international quickservice eating establishments casual dining fullservice restaurants street stalls or kiosks cafés100 home deliverytakeaway providers specialist coffee shops selfservice cafeterias and juicesmoothie bars the ieo segment excludes establishments that primarily serve alcohol and fullservice restaurants other than casual dining 

based on data from euromonitor international the global ieo segment was composed of approximately 8 million  outlets and generated 12 trillion  in annual sales in 2013  the most recent year for which data is available mcdonald’s systemwide 2013  restaurant business accounted for 04  of those outlets and 75  of the sales 

management also on occasion benchmarks mcdonald’s against the entire restaurant industry including the ieo segment defined above and all other fullservice restaurants based on data from euromonitor international the restaurant industry was composed of approximately 17 million  outlets and generated 23 trillion  in annual sales in 2013  mcdonald’s systemwide restaurant business accounted for 02  of those outlets and 38  of the sales 

  

 the company operates research and development facilities in the us europe and asia while research and development activities are important to the company’s business these expenditures are not material independent suppliers also conduct research activities that benefit the company its franchisees and suppliers collectively referred to as the system 

  

 increased focus by us and overseas governmental authorities on environmental matters is likely to lead to new governmental initiatives particularly in the area of climate change while we cannot predict the precise nature of these initiatives we expect that they may impact our business both directly and indirectly although the impact would likely vary by world region andor market we believe that adoption of new regulations may increase costs for the system also there is a possibility that governmental initiatives or actual or perceived effects of changes in weather patterns climate or water resources could have a direct impact on the operations of our restaurants or the operations of our suppliers in ways which we cannot predict at this time 

the company monitors developments related to environmental matters and plans to respond to governmental initiatives in a timely and appropriate manner at this time the company has already begun to undertake its own initiatives relating to preservation of the environment including the implementation of more energy efficient equipment and management of energy use and more sustainable sourcing practices in many of its markets 

  

 the company’s number of employees worldwide including companyoperated restaurant employees was approximately 420000  as of yearend 2014

 item 1a risk factors and cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements 

  

tableend

  

the information in this report includes forwardlooking statements about our plans and future performance including those under outlook these statements use such words as “may” “will” “expect” “believe” and “plan” they reflect our expectations and speak only as of the date of this report we do not undertake to update them our expectations or the underlying assumptions may change or not be realized and you should not rely unduly on forwardlooking statements our business results are subject to a variety of risks that are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe are most likely to affect our performance 

if we do not successfully design and execute our global growth strategies we may not be able to increase revenues or market share 

to drive future results our global growth strategies must be effective in achieving market share gains while at the same time delivering operating income growth our strategies are aligned 

 

around the four strategic growth priorities that represent our greatest opportunities to drive resultsserving our customers’ favorite food and drinks creating memorable experiences offering unparalleled convenience and being a more trusted brand we focus our system on execution across all of our strategies through a common integrated approach to people products place price and promotion whether we successfully execute these strategies depends mainly on our system’s ability to 

 if we are unsuccessful in executing our strategies or if our strategies do not yield the desired results our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

we face intense competition in our markets which could hurt our business 

we compete primarily in the ieo segment which is highly competitive in some of our major markets ieo segments have remained stagnant in recent periods have experienced only modest growth or have declined as a result we are facing sustained intense competition from both traditional and other competitors which include many nontraditional market participants such as convenience stores and coffee shops in addition in recent periods we have experienced emerging and growing competition from the fast casual category of restaurants we expect our environment to continue to be highly competitive and in any particular reporting period our results may be impacted by new actions of our competition which may have a short or longterm impact 

we compete on the basis of product choice quality affordability service and location in particular we believe our ability to compete successfully in the current market environment depends on our ability to improve existing products develop new products price our products appropriately manage the complexity of our restaurant operations and respond effectively to our competitors’ actions recognizing these dependencies we have intensified our focus in recent periods on strategies to achieve these goals and we will likely continue to modify existing strategies and implement new strategies in the future there can be no assurance these strategies will be effective and some strategies may be effective at improving some metrics while adversely affecting other metrics 

if we do not anticipate and address evolving consumer preferences our business could suffer 

our continued success depends on our system’s ability to anticipate and respond effectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics trends in food sourcing food preparation and consumer preferences in the ieo segment we must continuously adapt to deliver a relevant experience for our customers amidst a highly competitive valuedriven operating environment over the last year we have implemented initiatives to address these shifts at a more aggressive pace there is no assurance that such initiatives will be successful and if they are not our financial results could be adversely impacted 

  

mcdonalds corporation 2014 annual report 3 

if our pricing promotional and marketing plans are not effective our results may be negatively impacted 

our results depend on the impact of our pricing promotional and marketing plans and our system’s ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly to economic and competitive conditions our existing or future pricing strategies and the value proposition they represent will continue to be important components of our overall plan may not be successful and could negatively impact sales and margins the promotion of our menu offerings may yield results below desired levels 

additionally we operate in an increasingly complex and costly advertising environment our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful and we may fail to attract and retain customers we have increased our emphasis on digital offerings and customer loyalty initiatives and our success depends in part on whether we can effectively execute such offerings and initiatives in a way that will enhance customer engagement if our pricing promotional and marketing plans are not successful or are not as successful as those of our competitors our sales guest counts and market share could decrease 

failure to preserve the value and relevance of our brand could have a negative impact on our financial results 

to be successful in the future we believe we must preserve enhance and leverage the value of our brand brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of factors including the nutritional content and preparation of our food our business practices and the manner in which we source the commodities we use consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons for example nutritional health and other scientific studies and conclusions which constantly evolve and often have contradictory implications drive popular opinion litigation and regulation including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior in ways that affect the ieo segment or perceptions of our brand and could be material to our business perceptions may also be affected by activist campaigns to promote adverse perceptions of the quickservice category of the ieo segment or our brand andor our operations or to promote or threaten specific economic action involving the industry us our suppliers or franchisees if we are unsuccessful in addressing such adverse perceptions our brand and our financial results may suffer 

additionally the ongoing relevance of our brand may depend on the success of our sustainability initiatives to support our brand ambition of good food good people and good neighbor which will require systemwide coordination and alignment if we are not effective in achieving our stated sustainability goals and addressing these and other matters of social responsibility in a way that inspires trust and confidence trust in our brand could suffer in particular business incidents that erode consumer trust particularly if such incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results 

unfavorable general economic conditions could adversely affect our business and financial results 

our results of operations are substantially affected by economic conditions which can vary significantly by market and can impact consumer disposable income levels and spending habits economic conditions can also be impacted by a variety of factors including hostilities epidemics and actions taken by governments to manage national economic matters whether through austerity or stimulus measures and initiatives intended to control wages unemployment credit availability inflation taxation and other economic drivers many major economies both advanced and developing continue to face weak economies high 

 

unemployment rates and other ongoing economic issues continued adverse economic conditions or adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets could pressure our operating performance and our business and financial results may suffer 

supply chain interruptions may increase costs or reduce revenues 

we depend on the effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure reliable and sufficient product supply including on favorable terms the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers in countries around the world supply chain interruptions including due to lack of supply or price increases can adversely affect us or the suppliers and franchisees that are also part of our system and whose performance has a significant impact on our results such shortages or disruptions could be caused by factors beyond the control of our suppliers or us including inclement weather natural disasters increased demand problems in production or distribution disruptions in third party logistics or transportation systems the inability of our suppliers to obtain credit or food safety warnings or advisories if we experience interruptions in our supply chain our costs could increase and it could limit the availability of products critical to our operations 

food safety concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

our ability to increase sales and profits depends on our system’s ability to meet expectations for safe food and on our ability to manage the potential impact on mcdonald’s of foodborne illnesses and food or product safety issues that may arise in the future food safety is a top priority and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe food products however food safety events including instances of foodborne illness have occurred in the food industry in the past and could occur in the future in 2014 food quality issues were discovered at a supplier to mcdonald’s and other food companies in china as a consequence of this issue results in china japan and certain other markets were negatively impacted due to lost sales and profitability including expenses associated with rebuilding customer trust any future instances of food tampering food contamination or foodborne illness could adversely affect our brand and reputation as well as our revenues and profits 

our franchise business model presents a number of risks 

our success relies in part on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees yet we have limited influence over their operations our restaurant margins arise from two sources companyoperated restaurants and franchised restaurants our franchisees manage their businesses independently and therefore are responsible for the daytoday operation of their restaurants the revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales our franchisees may not experience sales growth and our revenues and margins could be negatively affected as a result if sales trends worsen for franchisees their financial results may deteriorate which could result in among other things restaurant closures or delayed or reduced payments to us 

our success also depends on the willingness and ability of our independent franchisees to implement major initiatives which may include financial investment and to remain aligned with us on operating promotional and capitalintensive reinvestment plans the ability of our franchisees to contribute to the achievement of our plans is dependent in large part on the availability of funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general or by the individual franchisees creditworthiness our operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety or 

4     mcdonalds corporation 2014 annual report 

other operational problems or project a brand image inconsistent with our values particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited costly to exercise or subject to litigation if franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards the brand’s image and reputation could be harmed which in turn could hurt our business and operating results 

our ownership mix also affects our results and financial condition the decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex and changing our ability to achieve the benefits of our refranchising strategy which involves a shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants will depend on various factors including our ability to identify franchisees that meet our rigorous standards the performance of our existing franchisees and whether the resulting ownership mix supports our financial objectives 

changes in commodity and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

the profitability of our companyowned restaurants depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs including food paper supply fuel utilities distribution and other operating costs any volatility in certain commodity prices could adversely affect our operating results by impacting restaurant profitability the commodity market for some of the ingredients we use such as beef and chicken is particularly volatile and is subject to significant price fluctuations due to seasonal shifts climate conditions industry demand international commodity markets food safety concerns product recalls government regulation and other factors all of which are beyond our control and in many instances unpredictable we can only partially address future price risk through hedging and other activities and therefore increases in commodity costs could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

the global scope of our operations subjects us to risks that could negatively affect our business 

we face differing cultural regulatory and economic environments that exist within and among the more than 100 countries where mcdonald’s restaurants operate and our ability to achieve our business objectives depends on our success in these environments meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment and our global success is partially dependent on our system’s ability to leverage operating successes across markets our initiatives may not have broad appeal with our customer base and could drive unanticipated changes in customer perceptions and guest counts 

disruptions in our operations or price volatility in a market can also result from governmental actions such as price foreign exchange or importexport controls increased tariffs governmentmandated closure of our or our suppliers’ operations and asset seizures the cost and disruption of responding to governmental investigations or actions whether or not they have merit may impact our results our international success depends in part on the effectiveness of our strategies and brandbuilding initiatives to reduce our exposure to such governmental actions our results of operations and financial condition are also affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may adversely affect reported earnings 

additionally we face challenges and uncertainties associated with operating in developing markets which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability economic volatility crime corruption and social and ethnic unrest for example our results have been negatively impacted by the ongoing events in the ukraine and russia such challenges are exacerbated in many 

 

cases by a lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainties in how local law is applied and enforced including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment if we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with our international operations it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

challenges with respect to talent management could harm our business 

our success depends in part on our system’s ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel to manage our operations for instance the trend toward higher wages and social expenses could have a negative impact on the margins of our companyowned restaurants additionally economic action such as boycotts protests work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations could adversely affect us or the franchisees and suppliers that are also part of the mcdonald’s system and whose performance has a material impact on our results 

we are also impacted by the costs and other effects of compliance with us and overseas regulations affecting our workforce which includes our staff and employees working in our companyowned restaurants these regulations are increasingly focused on wage and hour healthcare immigration retirement and other employee benefits and unlawful workplace discrimination our potential exposure to reputational and other harm regarding our workplace practices or conditions or those of our independent franchisees or suppliers or perceptions thereof could have a negative impact on our business 

information technology system failures or interruptions or breaches of our network security may interrupt our operations 

we are increasingly reliant on our technological systems eg pointofsale and other instore systems or platforms to conduct our business and any failure of these systems could significantly impact our operations despite our implementation of security measures our technology systems could become vulnerable to damage disability or failures due to theft fire power loss telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events if these systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way we could experience an interruption in our operations we may also not fully realize the benefits of the significant investments we are making to enhance the customer experience through digital engagement and social media 

furthermore security breaches involving our systems or those of third party providers may occur such as unauthorized access denial of service computer viruses and other disruptive problems caused by hackers our information technology systems contain personal financial and other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees as well as financial proprietary and other confidential information related to our business an actual or alleged security breach could result in system disruptions shutdowns theft or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information the occurrence of any of these incidents could result in adverse publicity loss of consumer confidence reduced sales and profits and criminal penalties or civil liabilities 

increasing regulatory complexity may adversely affect restaurant operations and our financial results 

our regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance and similar risks that could affect our operations and results in material ways in many of our markets including the united states and countries in europe we are subject to increasing regulation which has increased our cost of doing business we are affected by the cost compliance and other risks associated with the often conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations we face including where inconsistent standards 

  

mcdonalds corporation 2014 annual report 5 

imposed by multiple governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings 

our success depends in part on our ability to manage the impact of new potential or changing regulations that can affect our business plans these regulations may relate to product packaging marketing and the nutritional content and safety of our food and other products labeling and other disclosure practices particularly given varying requirements and practices for testing and disclosure ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from thirdparty suppliers 

additionally we are keenly aware of and working to manage the risks and costs to us our franchisees and our supply chain of the effects of climate change greenhouse gases energy and water resources the increased public focus including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations on these and other environmental sustainability matters eg packaging and waste animal health and welfare deforestation and land use and the increased pressure to make commitments set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them could expose us to market operational and execution costs or risks if we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with our complex regulatory environment it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

we are subject to increasing legal complexity and could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us 

increasing legal complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways we could be subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business including class actions administrative proceedings government investigations employment and personal injury claims landlordtenant disputes disputes with current or former suppliers claims by current or former franchisees and intellectual property claims including claims that we infringed another party’s trademarks copyrights or patents inconsistent standards imposed by governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation 

litigation involving our relationship with franchisees and the legal distinction between our franchisees and us for employment law purposes if determined adversely could increase costs negatively impact the business prospects of our franchisees and subject us to incremental liability for their actions we are also subject to the legal and compliance risks associated with privacy data collection protection and management in particular as it relates to information we collect when we provide technologyrelated services to franchisees 

our operating results could also be affected by the following 

 a judgment significantly in excess of any applicable insurance coverage could materially adversely affect our financial condition 

 

or results of operations further adverse publicity resulting from these claims may hurt our business 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately ensure that we are not infringing the intellectual property of others which could harm the value of the mcdonald’s brand and our business 

the success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights service marks trade secrets patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products we also license our intellectual property to franchisees and we cannot assure you that they will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property 

we have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions the trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the united states in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the united states and foreign countries may not be adequate in addition the steps we have taken may not adequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future in particular we may be involved in intellectual property claims including often aggressive or opportunistic attempts to enforce patents used in information technology systems which might affect our operations and results any claim of infringement whether or not it has merit could be timeconsuming could result in costly litigation and could harm our business 

changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and foreign jurisdictions and our operations plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives around the world in particular we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or related authoritative interpretations particularly if corporate tax reform becomes a key component of budgetary initiatives in the united states and elsewhere we are also impacted by settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by the irs or other taxing authorities in connection with our tax audits all of which will depend on their timing nature and scope any increases in income tax rates changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

changes in accounting standards or the recognition of impairment charges may adversely affect our future operations and results 

new accounting standards or changes in financial reporting requirements accounting principles or practices including with respect to our critical accounting estimates could affect our future results we may also be affected by the nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets including decisions that result in impairment charges that reduce our earnings in assessing the recoverability of our longlived assets we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors these estimates are highly subjective and can be significantly impacted by many factors such as global and local business and economic conditions operating costs inflation competition and consumer and demographic trends if our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future we may 

6     mcdonalds corporation 2014 annual report 

be required to record impairment charges if we experience any such changes they could have a significant effect on our reported results for the affected periods 

a decrease in our credit ratings or an increase in our funding costs could adversely affect our profitability 

we may be negatively affected by the impact of changes in our debt levels or our results of operations on our credit ratings interest expense availability of acceptable counterparties ability to obtain funding on favorable terms or our operating or financial flexibility especially if lenders impose new operating or financial covenants our operations may also be impacted by regulations affecting capital flows financial markets or financial institutions which can limit our ability to manage and deploy our liquidity or increase our funding costs if any of these events were to occur they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

trading volatility and price of our common stock may be affected by many factors 

many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects the most important of these some of which are outside our control are the following 

 our results and prospects can be adversely affected by events such as severe weather conditions natural disasters hostilities and social unrest among others 

severe weather conditions natural disasters hostilities and social unrest terrorist activities health epidemics or pandemics or expectations about them can adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels or other factors that affect our results and prospects such as commodity costs our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to certain of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully

under our conventional franchise arrangement franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment signs seating and décor of their restaurant business and by reinvesting in the business over time the company owns the land and building or secures longterm leases for both companyoperated and conventional franchised restaurant sites this maintains longterm occupancy rights helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees enabling restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry in certain circumstances the company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants in an effort to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives 

under our developmental license arrangement licensees provide capital for the entire business including the real estate interest and the company has no capital invested in addition the company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market 

we view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and believe franchising is paramount to both delivering great locallyrelevant customer experiences and driving profitability franchising enables an individual to own a restaurant business and maintain control over personnel purchasing marketing and pricing decisions while also benefiting from the financial strength and global experience of mcdonalds however directly operating restaurants is important to being a credible franchisor and is essential to providing company personnel with restaurant operations experience in our companyoperated restaurants and in collaboration with franchisees we further develop and refine operating standards marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants we continually review and as appropriate adjust our mix of companyoperated and franchised conventional franchised developmental licensed and foreign affiliated restaurants to help optimize overall performance 

the company’s revenues consist of sales by companyoperated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments and initial fees revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales and generally include initial fees fees vary by type of site amount of company investment if any and local business conditions these fees along with occupancy and operating rights are stipulated in franchiselicense agreements that generally have 20year terms 

the business is managed as distinct geographic segments significant reportable segments include the united states us europe and asiapacific middle east and africa apmea in addition throughout this report we present “other countries  corporate” that includes operations in canada and latin america as well as corporate activities the us europe and apmea segments account for 32  40  and 23  of total revenues respectively the united kingdom uk france russia and germany collectively account for 68  of europe’s revenues and 

 

china australia and japan a 50owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method collectively account for 52  of apmea’s revenues these seven markets along with the us and canada are referred to as “major markets” throughout this report and comprise 75  of total revenues 

in analyzing business trends management reviews results on a constant currency basis and considers a variety of performance and financial measures including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth systemwide sales growth operating income growth and returns 

 mcdonald’s reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days the number of weekdays and weekend days in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales and guest counts the company refers to these impacts as calendar shifttrading day adjustments in addition the timing of holidays can impact comparable sales and guest counts these impacts vary geographically due to consumer spending patterns and have a more pronounced effect on monthly comparable sales and guest counts while the annual impacts are typically minimal

strategic direction and financial performance 

the strength of the alignment among the company its franchisees and suppliers collectively referred to as the system has been key to mcdonalds longterm success by leveraging our system we are able to identify implement and scale ideas that meet customers changing needs and preferences in addition our business model enables mcdonalds to consistently deliver locallyrelevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve 

mcdonalds customerfocused plan to win plan provides a common framework that aligns our global business and allows for local adaptation through an emphasis on the plans five pillars  people products place price and promotion in 2014 we evolved our plan framework refocusing our planning and actions on what matters most to our customers the following four strategic growth priorities support our global plan 

 we believe that our strategic growth priorities align with our customers evolving needs and  combined with our competitive advantages of convenience scale geographic diversification and system alignment    will enhance our customers’ experience and build shareholder value over the longterm 

to measure our performance as we strive to build the business we have the following longterm average annual constant currency financial targets 

 in 2014 our results were disappointing as unforeseen events and weak operating performance pressured results in each of our geographic segments systemwide sales decreased 2 increased 1 in constant currencies operating income decreased 9 8 in constant currencies oneyear roiic was negative 219 and threeyear roiic was 14 see reconciliation on page 27 each metric fell below our longterm financial targets reflecting the impact of soft comparable sales performance and cost pressures negatively impacting all segments given our heavily franchised business model growing comparable sales is vital to increasing the companys operating income and returns 

we experienced challenges growing sales and guest counts in 2014 as comparable sales decreased 10 reflecting negative guest traffic in all segments while some of the challenges were anticipated others were not such as the impact of a supplier issue in china japan and certain other markets see explanation under apmea and the volatile operating environment in russia and the ukraine results were also impacted by underperformance in key opportunity markets that are significant contributors to consolidated results most notably the us 

we anticipate many of these challenges will persist in 2015 particularly in the first half of the year however we continue to believe that our longterm financial targets remain achievable over the long term keeping us focused on making the best decisions for the benefit of our shareholders and our system 

 

we are intensely focused on increasing customer relevance driving customer visits and positioning the company for future growth in 2014 we took a number of important steps to lay the foundation for our turnaround the following is a summary of our sales performance and critical actions taken to advance our longerterm strategies by major segment 

us 

in the us comparable sales declined 21 and comparable guest counts declined 41 guest visits were down as customerfocused initiatives did not resonate strongly amid the increasingly competitive marketplace and sluggish industry growth to enhance customer relevance and loyalty the us is focused on addressing menu service and value opportunities 

in 2014 we brought in new leadership to provide innovative thinking and a fresh strategic perspective and we announced actions to create a flatter more nimble us organization that places greater decision making and accountability closer to the customer 

menu strategies included a focus on continued growth at breakfast which remains our strongest daypart and an ongoing emphasis on core food and beverages in addition we executed initiatives to build brand trust through strengthened marketing efforts including the launch of a national food quality campaign 

the us focused on improving the service experience through an increased emphasis on operations excellence and investments made in establishing our digital platform including being the first in our industry to accept apple pay in the drivethru we continued to invest in new and existing restaurants by opening 222 new restaurants and reimaging approximately 260 locations of which the majority added or enhanced drivethru capacity currently about half of our restaurant interiors and exteriors reflect our contemporary restaurant design 

we evolved our value platform to reposition entrylevel affordability for future growth by providing a means to transition products to a higher price point when appropriate 

europe 

in europe comparable sales declined 06 while comparable guest counts declined 22 comparable sales reflected negative performance in germany and russia mostly offset by positive performance in the uk low consumer confidence and other external issues related to the operating environment in russia and ukraine negatively impacted business performance 

in 2014 we pursued customerfocused initiatives to deliver menu variety a contemporary restaurant experience and value enhancements we further optimized our menu through premium menu additions and expanded our mccafé platform with over 4000 restaurants now serving blended ice beverages 

we remain committed to reinvesting in existing restaurants through reimaging and technology initiatives to provide a relevant contemporary customer experience europe completed about 260 restaurant reimages during the year by the end of 2014 nearly 100 of restaurant interiors and 85 of exteriors were modernized we continued to leverage technology with over 2000 selforder kiosks and mobile ordering and payment capability available in certain markets 

 we increased our accessibility and convenience through daypart expansion including breakfast and overnight opening approximately 320 new restaurants and optimizing our drivethrus as value is paramount to european customers we continued to evolve and emphasize value offerings at every price tier

apmea 

in apmea comparable sales declined 33 and comparable guest counts declined 47 due to negative performance in japan and china this was slightly offset by positive results in australia the first of our priority markets to demonstrate signs of recovery due to strengthened marketing reemphasized value menu improvements and stronger franchisee alignment  

in midjuly food quality issues were discovered at a supplier to mcdonald’s and other food companies in china negatively impacting results in china japan and certain other markets we moved quickly to source from alternative suppliers and initiated aggressive recovery plans to restore consumer trust and confidence as a result of our efforts sales trends in china are showing signs of improvement mcdonalds japan is not recovering as quickly and has been working to overcome significant challenges 

we continued to make progress in our reimaging program completing about 340 restaurant reimages during the year by the end of 2014 over 70 of restaurant interiors and over 60 of exteriors were modernized 

we are committed to ongoing restaurant expansion although the pace of new openings was slowed in china in response to local market dynamics we opened 655 new restaurants including 227 in china 

global 

globally we have been focused on strengthening the foundational elements of our business namely value across the menu marketing and operations excellence to deliver a better customer experience while actively pursuing comprehensive initiatives to capture the sizeable longerterm growth opportunities in our industry 

even in periods of softer performance mcdonald’s unique business model and structure enable us to generate significant cash flows cash from operations benefits from our heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income we receive from franchisees provides a stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs and enables us to return significant cash to shareholders in addition the franchise business model is less capital intensive than the companyowned model   we believe locallyowned and operated restaurants are important to mcdonalds being not just a global brand but also a locallyrelevant one 

in 2014 cash from operations totaled 67 billion our substantial cash flow strong credit rating and continued access to credit provided us flexibility to invest in critical growth initiatives while still returning significant amounts of cash to shareholders capital expenditures of approximately 26 billion were invested in our business of which more than half was devoted to new restaurant openings and the remainder was reinvested in our existing restaurants across the system 1316 restaurants were opened and about 930 existing locations were reimaged 

as part of our ongoing commitment to build longterm shareholder value in may 2014 the company announced a 3year cash return target of 18 to 20 billion between 2014 and 2016 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases representing a 10 to 20 increase over the amount of cash returned between 2011 and 2013   this target is based on several activities including the significant free cash flow generated from our operations as well as the use of cash proceeds from our debt additions and refranchising at least 1500 restaurants over the 20142016 period over 400 restaurants were refranchised in 2014 primarily in apmea and europe in 2014 we returned 64 billion to shareholders consisting of 32 billion in dividends and 32 billion in share repurchases and remain on track to meet our 3year target 

 

results for the year

 outlook for 2015   

mcdonalds begins 2015 taking decisive action to drive foundational improvements in our major markets and executing our recovery efforts in markets affected by unforeseen events 

while we expect pressures on operating performance to persist as we continue to face significant headwinds particularly in the first half of the year sizable growth opportunities exist in the 12 trillion global ieo segment we are committed to pursuing these opportunities by relentlessly focusing on the customer and adapting to the changing marketplace through the following initiatives 

we are redefining menu choice and personalization exploring solutions that will provide our guests a customizable restaurant experience we are also focused on enhancing the appeal of our core products and addressing food perceptions by improving and highlighting the quality of our ingredients and engaging with our customers in more transparent dialogue 

convenience continues to be a cornerstone of mcdonalds business and we will evolve our value platform strategically evaluating pricing relationships across the entry level core and premium tiers service elements focus on hospitality and 

14     mcdonalds corporation 2014 annual report 

additional ways to serve customers such as selforder kiosks and table service and instore pick up or incar delivery in certain markets our digital strategy is built around improving the customer experience and customer engagement   

collectively these customerfocused initiatives represent the restaurant experience of the future and build upon investments we have already made in reimaging and technology 

the company is investing in these significant initiatives in a disciplined manner by partly redirecting ga dollars from the us business and corporate toward these longterm growth initiatives      

we will continue to invest in geographically diversified new restaurant development and reimaging of our existing restaurants’ interiors and exteriors our 2015 capital expenditure plan of approximately 20 billion  our lowest capital budget in more than 5 years  demonstrates financial discipline as we strategically target fewer openings in our most challenged markets we believe this lower level of capital spending is prudent while we work to regain our business momentum 

mcdonald’s remains committed to growing our business sustainably and making a positive difference in society by serving good food through good people and being a good neighbor in the communities in which we operate 

us 

the us begins 2015 with new leadership focused on a strategic roadmap including a revamped marketing approach greater customization localization and menu simplification our revamped marketing approach includes a new national brand campaign complemented by local advertising that is more responsive to individual market preferences we plan to execute initiatives that are designed to address customer insights and the competitive dynamics that are unique to each market we are focused on strengthening our menu pipeline by providing more choice and customization with plans to begin expanding the create your taste platform in 2015 our menu initiatives also include plans to enhance core products particularly in the chicken and beef categories we are also refining our value proposition to offer the right balance of value and choice and to create more logical relationships across menu price tiers we plan to open about 125 new restaurants and reimage approximately 100 existing restaurants in 2015 

europe

in 2014  constant currency revenue was flat compared to the prior year reflecting the impact of negative comparable sales partially offset by expansion in 2013  constant currency revenue growth was due to expansion weak comparable sales reflected a muted response to customerfacing initiatives amid a highly competitive and sluggish ieo segment across many markets 



in the us revenues decreased in 2014 due to negative comparable sales reflecting negative comparable guest counts amid ongoing broadbased challenges including sustained competitive activity revenues were relatively flat in 2013 as the positive impact of expansion was offset by negative comparable sales

franchised margins 

in the us the franchised margin percent decreased in 2014 primarily due to negative comparable sales and higher occupancy costs the decrease in 2013 was due to higher depreciation related to reimaging and weak comparable sales 

  

mcdonalds corporation 2014 annual report 19 

in europe the franchised margin percent decreased in 2014 primarily due to the impact of refranchising and negative comparable sales   the decrease in 2013 was due to higher rent expense in many markets and weak comparable sales primarily due to germany 

in apmea the franchised margin percent decreased in 2014 partly due to the negative impact of the supplier issue in japan which reduced japans favorable contribution to the segments margin percent in addition higher occupancy costs and refranchising negatively impacted the margin percent the decrease in 2013 was partly due to japans negative sales performance and the impact of the weaker yen in addition the segment was negatively impacted by a decline in australias results 

in connection with our 20142016 cash return target we plan to refranchise at least 1500 restaurants by selling companyoperated restaurants to conventional franchisees and developmental licensees while this refranchising activity may have a dilutive effect on the franchised margin percent it results in higher franchised margin dollars 

in addition the franchised margin percent in apmea and other countries  corporate is higher relative to the us and europe due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed andor affiliated restaurants where the company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs 

 companyoperated margin dollars represent sales by companyoperated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants   companyoperated margin dollars decreased   415 million  or 13   11  in constant currencies in 2014  reflecting weak results across all segments in 2013  companyoperated margin dollars decreased 83 million  or 2   2  in constant currencies reflecting weak comparable sales in many markets which impacted our ability to overcome cost pressures 

 

companyoperated margins

selling general  administrative expenses 

consolidated selling general and administrative expenses increased   4   5  in constant currencies in 2014  and decreased 3 3 in constant currencies in 2013 the increase in 2014 was primarily due to higher employee and other costs the 2014 winter olympics and the worldwide owneroperator convention partly offset by a reduction in incentivebased compensation the decrease in 2013 was due to lower incentivebased compensation partly offset by higher employee costs in addition 2013 benefited from the comparison to costs in 2012 related to the london olympics and the worldwide owneroperator convention 

selling general  administrative expenses 



 selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues was 91  in 2014  85  in 2013  and 89  in 2012  selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales was 28  in 2014  27  in 2013  and 28  in 2012  management believes that analyzing selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales as well as revenues is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support the overall mcdonalds business

in july 2012 the company’s board of directors approved a 10 billion share repurchase program with no specified expiration date 2012 program in may 2014 the companys board of directors terminated the 2012 program and replaced it with a new share repurchase program effective july 1 2014 that authorizes the purchase of up to 10 billion of the companys outstanding common stock with no specified expiration date in 2014 approximately 331 million shares were repurchased for 32 billion of which approximately 205 million shares or 19 billion were repurchased under the new program 

the company has paid dividends on its common stock for 39 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year the 2014 full year dividend of  328  per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of 081 per share with an increase to 085 per share paid in the fourth quarter this 5 increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a 340 per share annual dividend and reflects the company’s confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow as in the past future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs and will be declared at the discretion of the company’s board of directors 



total assets and returns 

total assets decreased 23 billion or 6 in 2014 excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates total assets increased 578 million in 2014 nearly 80 of total assets were in major markets at yearend 2014 net property and equipment decreased 12 billion in 2014 primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation and depreciation partly offset by capital expenditures and represented about 70 of total assets at year end 

operating income is used to compute return on average assets while net income is used to calculate return on average common equity monthend balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity 

returns on assets and equity 



in 2014 and 2013 return on average assets and return on average common equity decreased reflecting lower operating results operating income does not include interest income however cash balances are included in average assets the inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by about two percentage points for all years presented

financing and market risk

fitch standard  poor’s and moody’s currently rate with a stable outlook the company’s commercial paper f1 a1 and p1 respectively and its longterm debt a a and a2 respectively 

certain of the company’s debt obligations contain crossacceleration provisions and restrictions on company and subsidiary mortgages and the longterm debt of certain subsidiaries there are no provisions in the company’s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the company’s business under existing authorization from the company’s board of directors at december 31 2014 the company had 45 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds including through i public or private offering of debt securities ii direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions and iii other forms of indebtedness in addition to debt securities available through a mediumterm notes program registered with the us securities and exchange commission sec and a global mediumterm notes program the company has 25 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the us and global markets see debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements debt maturing in 2015 is approximately 11 billion of longterm corporate debt in 2015 the company expects to issue commercial paper and longterm debt to refinance this maturing debt as of december 31 2014 the companys subsidiaries also had 863 million of borrowings outstanding primarily under uncommitted foreign currency line of credit agreements 

the company uses major capital markets bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense the company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring redeeming and repurchasing debt terminating swaps and using derivatives the company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes all swaps are overthecounter instruments 

 

in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations the company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated the company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties intercompany financings and longterm investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates this reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders’ equity total foreign currencydenominated debt was 59 billion and 58 billion for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively in addition where practical the company’s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges see the summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives 

the company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below or aggregate exposures exceed certain contractual limits at december 31 2014 neither the company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position other than on hedges of certain of the company’s supplemental benefit plan liabilities where our counterparty was required to post collateral on its liability position 

the company’s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies the company’s largest net asset exposures defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities at year end were as follows 

foreign currency net asset exposures 



the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the company’s results of operations cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments the interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10 in the same direction relative to the us dollar on all financial instruments however the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets based on the results of these analyses of the company’s financial instruments neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2014 levels nor a 10 adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2014 levels would materially affect the company’s results of operations cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments 

liquidity 

the company has significant operations outside the us where we earn over 60 of our operating income a significant portion of these historical earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the company has made 

24     mcdonalds corporation 2014 annual report 

and will continue to make substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations accordingly no us federal or state income taxes have been provided on these undistributed foreign earnings the companys cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately 12 billion as of december 31 2014  we do not intend nor do we foresee a need to repatriate these funds 

consistent with prior years we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents domestic cash flows from operations annual repatriation of a portion of the current periods foreign earnings and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating investing and financing activities we also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating investing and financing activities 

in the future should we require more capital to fund activities in the us than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods earnings from foreign jurisdictions this could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the future 

while the likelihood is remote to the extent foreign cash is available the company could also elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise the company may be subject to additional us income taxes net of an adjustment for foreign tax credits which could result in a use of cash this could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the period in which such a determination is made to repatriate prior period foreign earnings refer to the income taxes note to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to our income taxes and the undistributed earnings of the companys foreign subsidiaries 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the company has longterm contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations related to both companyoperated and franchised restaurants and debt obligations in addition the company has longterm revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements cash provided by operations including cash provided by these franchise arrangements along with the company’s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations the following table summarizes the company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the company under existing franchise arrangements as of december 31 2014  see discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 





 

in the us the company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to i make taxdeferred contributions and ii receive companyprovided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of internal revenue service irs limitations at december 31 2014  total liabilities for the supplemental plans were 534 million  

in addition total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were 988 million  at december 31 2014  

there are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction inventory energy marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business the amounts related to these commitments are not significant to the company’s financial position such commitments are generally shorter term in nature and will be funded from operating cash flows 



critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions 

the company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

 property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straightline basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets taking into account anticipated technological or other changes the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors economic factors and industry trends if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or writeoffs in future periods 

 the company has a sharebased compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equitybased incentives including stock options and restricted stock units rsus to employees and nonemployee directors the expense for these equitybased incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period 

the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closedform pricing model the pricing model requires assumptions which impact the assumed fair value including the expected life of the stock option the riskfree interest rate expected volatility of the company’s stock over the expected 

  

mcdonalds corporation 2014 annual report 25 

life and the expected dividend yield the company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants sharebased compensation expense will fluctuate in future years the fair value of each rsu granted is equal to the market price of the company’s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period 

 longlived assets including goodwill are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in assessing the recoverability of the company’s longlived assets the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the company’s experience and knowledge of its operations these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions operating costs inflation competition and consumer and demographic trends a key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales if the company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future the company may be required to record impairment charges based on the annual goodwill impairment test conducted in the fourth quarter the company does not have any reporting units defined as each individual country with risk of material goodwill impairment 

 in the ordinary course of business the company is subject to proceedings lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors customers employees franchisees government agencies intellectual property shareholders and suppliers the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses a determination of the amount of accrual required if any for these contingencies is made after 

careful analysis of each matter the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters the company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 

 the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies including the sale of appreciated assets in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if these estimates and assumptions change in the future the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance this could result in a charge to or an increase in income in the period such determination is made 

the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 

in 2014 the company increased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken in prior years by 505 million most of which came from foreignrelated tax matters after considering the impact of deferred tax offsets interest and penalties these foreignrelated tax matters impacted the effective tax rate by 41 see the income taxes footnote in the   

 

consolidated financial statements for the related tax reconciliations the most significant new developments in 2014 are described below 

in 2014 the company received an unfavorable lower tax court ruling in a foreign tax jurisdiction related to exempt income matters as a result of this new information the company changed its judgment on the sustainability of this tax position for 20032010 and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits of 188 million the company intends to pursue all available remedies to defend this tax position 

in addition the company received new information from tax authorities during the progression of tax audits in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions including the receipt of proposed tax assessments primarily related to transfer pricing matters as a result of this new information the company changed its judgment on the measurement of the related unrecognized tax benefits and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits of 207 million the company settled certain of these tax audits in 2014 and plans to defend its position with the tax authorities on the remaining audits 

also in 2014 the internal revenue service “irs” concluded its field examination of the company’s us federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010 in connection with this examination the company agreed to certain adjustments proposed by the irs the liabilities previously recorded related to these adjustments were adequate in connection with this examination the company also received notices of proposed adjustments nopas related to certain transfer pricing matters and engaged in audit defense discussions with the irs as a result of this new information the company changed its judgment on the measurement of the related unrecognized tax benefits and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits of 38 million the company disagrees with these proposed adjustments and will file a protest with the irs appeals office in 2015 

 while the company cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the aforementioned tax matters we believe that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined in accordance with topic 740  income taxes of the accounting standards codification “asc” 

in 2012 the irs completed its examination of the companys us federal income tax returns for 2007 and 2008 the company and the irs reached an agreement on adjustments that had been previously proposed by the irs the agreement did not have a material impact on the companys cash flows results of operations or financial position 

deferred us income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling 154 billion  related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates the temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the us if managements intentions change in the future deferred taxes may need to be provided 

effects of changing prices—inflation 

the company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively this ability is because of rapid inventory turnover the ability to adjust menu prices cost controls and substantial property holdings many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation

reconciliation of returns on incremental invested capital 

roiic is a measure reviewed by management over oneyear and threeyear time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of our markets the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital this measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation the numerator is the company’s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period 

the denominator is the weightedaverage cash used for investing activities during the applicable oneor threeyear period the weightedaverage cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis these weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter’s investing activities to incremental operating income for example fourth quarter 2014  investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income 125 of fourth quarter 2014  investing activities are included in the oneyear and threeyear calculations in contrast fourth quarter 2013  is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago and therefore have a fullyear impact on 2014  operating income with little or no impact to the base period 875 and 1000 of fourth quarter 2013  investing activities are included in the oneyear and threeyear calculations respectively cash used for investing activities can vary significantly by quarter resulting in a weightedaverage that may be higher or lower than the simple average of the periods presented management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average 

the reconciliations to the most comparable measurements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us for the numerator and denominator of the oneyear and threeyear roiic are as follows

 the company’s business is not dependent upon either a single customer or small group of customers 

  

 companyoperated restaurants have no backlog orders 

  

 no material portion of the business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the us government 

  

 mcdonald’s restaurants compete with international national regional and local retailers of food products the company competes on the basis of price convenience service menu variety and product quality in a highly fragmented global restaurant industry 

in measuring the company’s competitive position management reviews data compiled by euromonitor international a leading source of market data with respect to the global restaurant industry the company’s primary competition which management refers to as the informal eating out ieo segment includes the following restaurant categories defined by euromonitor international quickservice eating establishments casual dining fullservice restaurants street stalls or kiosks cafés100 home deliverytakeaway providers specialist coffee shops selfservice cafeterias and juicesmoothie bars market data related to cafés is separately available and now included in the ieo segment the ieo segment excludes establishments that primarily serve alcohol and fullservice restaurants other than casual dining 

based on data from euromonitor international the global ieo segment was composed of approximately 8 million  outlets and generated 12 trillion  in annual sales in 2012  the most recent year for which data is available mcdonald’s systemwide 2012  restaurant business accounted for 04  of those outlets and about 8  of the sales 

management also on occasion benchmarks mcdonald’s against the entire restaurant industry including the ieo segment defined above and all other fullservice restaurants based on data from euromonitor international the restaurant industry was composed of approximately 16 million  outlets and generated 23 trillion  in annual sales in 2012  mcdonald’s systemwide restaurant business accounted for 02  of those outlets and about 4  of the sales 

  

 the company operates research and development facilities in the us europe and asia while research and development activities are important to the company’s business these expenditures are not material independent suppliers also conduct research activities that benefit the company its franchisees and suppliers collectively referred to as the system 

  

 increased focus by us and overseas governmental authorities on environmental matters is likely to lead to new governmental initiatives particularly in the area of climate change while we cannot predict the precise nature of these initiatives we expect that they may impact our business both directly and indirectly 

 

although the impact would likely vary by world region andor market we believe that adoption of new regulations may increase costs including for the company its franchisees and suppliers also there is a possibility that governmental initiatives or actual or perceived effects of changes in weather patterns or climate could have a direct impact on the operations of our restaurants or the operations of our suppliers in ways which we cannot predict at this time 

the company monitors developments related to environmental matters and plans to respond to governmental initiatives in a timely and appropriate manner at this time the company has already begun to undertake its own initiatives relating to preservation of the environment including the implementation of more energy efficient equipment and management of energy use in many of its markets 

  

 the company’s number of employees worldwide including companyoperated restaurant employees was approximately 440000  as of yearend 2013

 item 1a risk factors and cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements 

  

tableend

  

the information in this report includes forwardlooking statements about our plans and future performance including those under outlook these statements use such words as “may” “will” “expect” “believe” and “plan” they reflect our expectations and speak only as of the date of this report we do not undertake to update them our expectations or the underlying assumptions may change or not be realized and you should not rely unduly on forwardlooking statements 

our business and execution of our strategic plan the plan to win are subject to risks the most important of these is whether we can remain relevant and a brand customers trust meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment challenging economic conditions continue to pressure our operating and financial performance in particular in some of our major markets ieo segments may remain stagnant or experience modest growth reflecting broadbased consumer caution price sensitivity and intensifying competitive activity by both traditional and nontraditional competitors further certain menu pricing and promotional decisions may continue to yield results below desired levels and could continue to negatively impact sales guest counts and market share as our business model is built around growing comparable sales to realize margin leverage given these conditions and persistent cost pressures we expect our results for 2014 will remain challenged 

we have the added challenge of the cultural and regulatory differences that exist within and among the more than 100 countries where we operate initiatives we undertake may not have universal appeal among different segments of our customer base and can drive unanticipated changes in guest counts and customer perceptions our operations plans and results are also affected by regulatory tax and other initiatives around the world notably the focus on nutritional content and the sourcing processing and preparation of food “from field to front counter” as well as industry marketing practices 

these risks can have an impact both in the near and longterm and are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe are most likely to affect our performance 

our ability to remain a relevant and trusted brand and to increase sales and profits depends largely on how well we execute the plan to win and our global growth priorities 

the plan to win aligns the mcdonalds system around the three global growth priorities that represent our greatest opportunities to drive results  optimizing our menu modernizing the customer experience and broadening accessibility to our brand in order to remain relevant to our customers it also keeps us focused on a common approach to execution through our continued emphasis on people products place price and promotion the  quality of our execution depends mainly on the following 



 



  

mcdonalds corporation 2013 annual report 3 

perceptions of the quickservice category of the ieo segment or our brand management suppliers or franchisees or to promote or threaten boycotts strikes or other actions involving the industry mcdonald’s or our suppliers and franchisees 

 our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions and the prolonged challenging economic environment can be expected to continue to pressure our results 

our results of operations are substantially affected by economic conditions both globally and in local markets and conditions can also vary substantially by market the current global environment has been characterized by persistently weak economies high unemployment rates inflationary pressures and volatility in financial markets many major economies both advanced and developing are still facing ongoing economic issues in the us these include concerns about the longterm direction of federal fiscal policies in many european markets consumer and business confidence and spending remain muted important markets in asia have also been experiencing slower growth rates uncertainty about the longterm environment could derail any potential improvements in economic activity for 2014 

these conditions have pressured our performance adversely affecting sales guest counts andor our market share in many markets including some major markets we are also facing increasing competition from an expanded set of competitors that include many nontraditional market participants such as conventional retailers and coffee shops to address this environment we are intensifying our focus on value as a driver of guest counts through menu pricing and promotional actions these actions can adversely affect our margin percent and therefore we expect that margins will remain under pressure the key factors that can affect our operations plans and results in this environment are the following 



 

 increasing legal and regulatory complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways 

our legal and regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance litigation and similar risks tha t could affect our operations and results in material ways in many of our markets including the united states and europe we are subject to increasing regulation which has increased our cost of doing business in developing markets we face the risks associated with new and untested laws and judicial systems among the more important regulatory and litigation risks we face and must manage are the following 



4     mcdonalds corporation 2013 annual report 

opportunistic attempts to enforce patents used in information technology systems the relative level of our defense costs which vary from period to period depending on the number nature and procedural status of pending proceedings the cost and other effects of settlements or judgments which may require us to make disclosures or take other actions that may affect perceptions of our brand and products and the scope and terms of insurance or indemnification protections that we may have 



 

trading volatility and price of our common stock may be affected by many factors 

many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects the most important of these some of which are outside our control are the following 

 our results and prospects can be adversely affected by events such as severe weather conditions natural disasters hostilities and social unrest among others 

severe weather conditions natural disasters hostilities and social unrest terrorist activities health epidemics or pandemics or expectations about them can adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels or other factors that affect our results and prospects such as commodity costs our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to certain of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully

overview 

description of the business 

the company franchises and operates mcdonald’s restaurants of the 35429  restaurants in 119  countries at yearend 2013  28691  were franchised including 20355  franchised to conventional franchisees 4747  licensed to developmental licensees and 3589  licensed to foreign affiliates affiliates—primarily japan and 6738  were operated by the company under our conventional franchise arrangement franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment signs seating and décor of their restaurant business and by reinvesting in the business over time the company owns the land and building or secures longterm leases for both companyoperated and conventional franchised restaurant sites this maintains longterm occupancy rights helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees in certain circumstances the company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants under our developmental license arrangement licensees provide capital for the entire business including the real estate interest and the company has no capital invested in addition the company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market 

we view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and believe franchising is important to both delivering great locallyrelevant customer experiences and driving profitability however directly operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and is essential to providing company personnel with restaurant operations experience in our companyoperated restaurants and in collaboration with franchisees we further develop and refine operating standards marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants we continually review and as appropriate adjust our mix of companyoperated and franchised conventional franchised developmental licensed and foreign affiliated restaurants to help optimize overall performance 

the company’s revenues consist of sales by companyoperated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments and initial fees revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales and generally include initial fees fees vary by type of site amount of company investment if any and local business conditions these fees along with occupancy and operating rights are stipulated in franchiselicense agreements that generally have 20year terms 

the business is managed as distinct geographic segments significant reportable segments include the united states us europe and asiapacific middle east and africa apmea in addition throughout this report we present “other countries  corporate” that includes operations in canada and latin america as well as corporate activities the us europe and apmea segments account for 31  40  and 23  of total revenues respectively the united kingdom uk france russia and germany collectively account for 67  of europe’s revenues and china australia and japan a 50owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method collectively account for 54  of apmea’s revenues these seven markets along with the us and canada are referred to as “major markets” throughout this report and comprise 75  of total revenues 

in analyzing business trends management reviews results on a constant currency basis and considers a variety of performance 

 

and financial measures including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth systemwide sales growth and returns 

 mcdonald’s reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days the number of weekdays and weekend days in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales and guest counts the company refers to these impacts as calendar shifttrading day adjustments in addition the timing of holidays can impact comparable sales and guest counts these impacts vary geographically due to consumer spending patterns and have a more pronounced effect on monthly comparable sales and guest counts while the annual impacts are typically minimal 

 strategic direction and financial performance 

the strength of the alignment among the company its franchisees and suppliers collectively referred to as the system has been key to mcdonalds success by leveraging our system we are able to identify implement and scale ideas that meet customers changing needs and preferences in addition our business model 

10     mcdonalds corporation 2013 annual report 

enables mcdonalds to consistently deliver locallyrelevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve 

mcdonalds customerfocused plan to win plan provides a common framework that aligns our global business and allows for local adaptation we continue to focus on our three global growth priorities of optimizing our menu modernizing the customer experience and broadening accessibility to brand mcdonalds within the framework of our plan our initiatives support these priorities and are executed with a focus on the plans five pillars  people products place price and promotion  to enhance our customers experience and build shareholder value over the long term we believe these priorities align with our customers evolving needs and  combined with our competitive advantages of convenience menu variety geographic diversification and system alignment  will drive longterm sustainable growth 

to measure our performance as we strive to build the business we have the following longterm average annual constant currency financial targets 

 in 2013 systemwide sales growth was 1 3 in constant currencies operating income growth was 2 3 in constant currencies oneyear roiic was 114  and threeyear roiic was 202  see reconciliation on page 23 our operating income growth and returns fell below our longterm financial targets reflecting the impact of soft comparable sales performance in our heavily franchised business model growing comparable sales is important to increasing operating income and returns 

in 2013 our comparable sales increased 02 reflecting higher average check and negative comparable guest counts of 19 challenging conditions including a flat or contracting informal eating out “ieo” segment in most major markets heightened competitive activity and consumer price sensitivity continued to pressure performance furthermore mcdonald’s customerfacing initiatives did not generate the comparable sales lift or customer visits necessary to overcome these headwinds 

in 2014 we do not expect significant changes in market dynamics given modest growth projections for the ieo segment however we continue to believe that our targets remain achievable over the long term 

the following is a summary of our 2013 sales performance and our initiatives within the three global growth priorities by major segment 

us 

in the us comparable sales declined 02 and comparable guest counts declined 16 guest visits were down as initiatives did not resonate as strongly as expected with customers amid a sluggish ieo segment and heightened competitive activity 

the us introduced a number of significant new products such as premium mcwraps egg white delight mcmuffins and an extended lineup of quarter pounder burgers and featured new limitedtime food and beverage options to enhance the relevance of its product offerings 

modernizing the customer experience continued through our reimaging program during 2013 we completed about 700 restaurant reimages of which the majority added drivethru capacity currently 45 of our restaurant interiors and exteriors reflect our contemporary restaurant design 

 

we broadened accessibility by opening 225 new restaurants extending hours in more restaurants and improving the efficiency of our drivethru service with sidebyside or tandem ordering and handheld order taking more than half of our restaurants now use one of these multiple order points to maximize drivethru capacity in addition the us evolved its value proposition with the recent introduction of dollar menu  more which is intended to offer value and variety to our customers at various price points 

europe 

in europe comparable sales were flat while comparable guest counts declined 15 as persistently low consumer confidence continued to negatively affect the ieo segment comparable sales results reflected positive performance in the uk and russia which were mostly offset by weak performance in germany where we are working on rebuilding brand relevance to address the current negative guest count trend 

in 2013 we remained focused on growing the business by emphasizing value menu enhancements premium menu additions limitedtime offers and expansion of the breakfast daypart we also successfully launched blended ice beverages in the uk which positively contributed to results 

in order to continue providing a relevant contemporary customer experience europe completed about 470 restaurant reimages during the year by the end of 2013 nearly 100 of restaurant interiors and 80 of exteriors were modernized 

we increased our accessibility and convenience by opening 312 new restaurants extending operating hours and optimizing our drivethrus we enhanced our value offerings in certain markets with multiple pricing tiers across our menu to appeal to a broad range of customers for example in france we launched the cassecroûte a twoitem meal for 450 euro which positively contributed to recent results in that market 

apmea 

in apmea comparable sales declined 19 and comparable guest counts declined 38 our three largest markets experienced negative comparable sales with japan having the most significant impact though the challenges differ across the segment overall performance was pressured amid slower economic growth a highly competitive environment focused primarily on value and issues such as avian influenza in a few markets in addition softer than expected performance of new products and promotions did not overcome negative guest count trends 

throughout the segment we focused on accelerating growth across all dayparts with particular emphasis on dinner and the expansion of breakfast apmea held a national breakfast day during which five thousand restaurants gave away five million egg mcmuffins to promote breakfast in the segment we were also committed to enhancing local relevance with consumers by balancing our global core menu with locallyrelevant food and beverage choices which included new flavor profiles designed to match local tastes 

we continued to make progress in our reimaging program completing about 240 restaurant reimages during the year by the end of 2013 over 65 of restaurant interiors and over 55 of exteriors were modernized 

we opened 731 new restaurants including 275 in china we deployed our convenience initiatives to more restaurants including dessert kiosks delivery service drivethrus and extended hours in addition we continued to evolve our everyday value platform by including more affordable menu options and promotional offers across dayparts and price points 

  

mcdonalds corporation 2013 annual report 11 

consolidated operating results 

globally our approach to offering variety and value across the menu to our customers is complemented by a focus on driving operating efficiencies and leveraging our scale and supply chain infrastructure to manage costs in 2013 we maintained a fullyear combined operating margin of 312 as we grew revenues 2 and managed our expenses 

we continued our longstanding commitment to fiscal discipline and maintained a strong financial foundation cash from operations benefits from our heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income we receive from franchisees provides a stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs in addition the franchise business model is less capital intensive than the companyowned model we believe locallyowned and operated restaurants are important to mcdonalds being not just a global brand but also a locallyrelevant one 

in 2013 cash from operations was 71 billion   our substantial cash flow strong credit rating and continued access to credit provided us flexibility to fund capital expenditures as well as return cash to shareholders capital expenditures of approximately 28 billion were invested in our business of which more than half was devoted to new restaurant openings and the remainder was reinvested in our existing restaurants across the system 1438 restaurants were opened and over 1500 existing locations were reimaged 

we continued to return all free cash flow cash from operations less capital expenditures to shareholders and in 2013 returned 49 billion to shareholders consisting of 31 billion in dividends and 18 billion in share repurchases

we remain committed to adapting to keep pace with evolving customer needs and investing today to meet future demand in addition we are prioritizing our nearterm efforts on improving performance in key opportunity markets that are significant contributors to consolidated results these include germany japan and the us which have experienced weak or negative performance 

we will continue to execute against our three global growth priorities to optimize our menu modernize the customer experience and broaden accessibility to brand mcdonald’s

us 

in 2014 the us will make adjustments designed to regain momentum including providing greater customer relevance and better restaurant execution our 2014 menu strategies better balance affordability core products new choices and limitedtime offers we will also adjust the pace of product introductions to improve restaurant operations and marketing execution in order to provide a better customer experience these initiatives are complemented by a consistent focus on core equities such as breakfast we will enhance the breakfast experience by emphasizing coffee through highquality mccafé products paired with delicious foods  both existing and new bold new flavor extensions will be introduced to build upon our core and lay the groundwork for future innovations we plan to open about 250 new restaurants and to continue our reimaging program by updating   approximately 300 existing restaurants in 2014 a slightly slower pace as we prioritize other kitchen investments 

europe 

in europe we plan to optimize the menu through value menu enhancements premium menu additions and limitedtime offers and will continue to expand the breakfast daypart by leveraging our strong foundation in coffee in addition following the uk’s successful rollout of mccafé smoothies and frappés we anticipate about 4500 restaurants in europe will have the blendedice platform by the end of 2014 

to modernize the way we interact with our customers we plan to leverage the use of technology such as selforder kiosks and mobile and web ordering we will focus on broadening accessibility by continuing to extend operating hours optimizing drivethrus and expanding everyday value platforms we plan to open over 300   new restaurants and reimage approximately 400 existing restaurants in 2014

impact of foreign currency translation on reported results 

while changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results mcdonald’s mitigates exposures where practical by purchasing goods and services in local currencies financing in local currencies and hedging certain foreigndenominated cash flows 

in 2013 foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results due to the weaker australian dollar japanese yen and many other foreign currencies partly offset by the stronger euro in 2012 foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results primarily due to the weaker euro along with most other currencies in 2011 foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results driven by the stronger euro and australian dollar as well as most other currencies

foreign currency net asset exposures 



the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the company’s results of operations cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments the interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10 in the same direction relative to the us dollar on all financial instruments however the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets based on the results of these analyses of the company’s financial instruments neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2013 levels nor a 10 adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2013 levels would materially affect the company’s results of operations cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments 

liquidity 

the company has significant operations outside the us where we earn over 60 of our operating income a significant portion of these historical earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the company has made 

  

mcdonalds corporation 2013 annual report 21 

and will continue to make substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations accordingly no us federal or state income taxes have been provided on these undistributed foreign earnings the companys cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately 20 billion as of december 31 2013  we do not intend nor do we foresee a need to repatriate these funds 

consistent with prior years we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents domestic cash flows from operations annual repatriation of a portion of the current periods foreign earnings and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating investing and financing activities we also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating investing and financing activities 

in the future should we require more capital to fund activities in the us than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods earnings from foreign jurisdictions this could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the future 

while the likelihood is remote to the extent foreign cash is available the company could also elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise the company may be subject to additional us income taxes net of an adjustment for foreign tax credits which could result in a use of cash this could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the period in which such a determination is made to repatriate prior period foreign earnings refer to the income taxes note to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to our income taxes and the undistributed earnings of the companys foreign subsidiaries 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the company has longterm contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations related to both companyoperated and franchised restaurants and debt obligations in addition the company has longterm revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements cash provided by operations including cash provided by these franchise arrangements along with the company’s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations the following table summarizes the company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the company under existing franchise arrangements as of december 31 2013  see discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details

there are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction inventory energy marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business the amounts related to these commitments are not significant to the company’s financial position such commitments are generally shorter term in nature and will be funded from operating cash flows 



critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions 

the company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

 property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straightline basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets taking into account anticipated technological or other changes the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors economic factors and industry trends if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or writeoffs in future periods 

 the company has a sharebased compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equitybased incentives including stock options and restricted stock units rsus to employees and nonemployee directors the expense for these equitybased incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period 

the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closedform pricing model the pricing model requires assumptions which impact the assumed fair value including the expected life of the stock option the riskfree interest rate expected volatility of the company’s stock over the expected 

22     mcdonalds corporation 2013 annual report 

life and the expected dividend yield the company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants sharebased compensation expense will fluctuate in future years the fair value of each rsu granted is equal to the market price of the company’s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period 

 longlived assets including goodwill are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in assessing the recoverability of the company’s longlived assets the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the company’s experience and knowledge of its operations these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions operating costs inflation competition and consumer and demographic trends a key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales if the company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future the company may be required to record impairment charges based on the annual goodwill impairment test conducted in the fourth quarter the company does not have any reporting units defined as each individual country with goodwill currently at risk of impairment 

 in the ordinary course of business the company is subject to proceedings lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors customers employees franchisees government agencies intellectual property shareholders and suppliers the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses a determination of the amount of accrual required if any for these contingencies is made after 

careful analysis of each matter the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters the company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 

 the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies including the sale of appreciated assets in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if these estimates and assumptions change in the future the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance this could result in a charge to or an increase in income in the period such determination is made 

the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter in 2012 the internal revenue service irs completed its examination of the companys us federal income tax returns for 2007 and 2008 the company and the irs reached an agreement on adjustments that had been previously proposed by the irs the agreement did not have a material impact on the companys cash flows results of operations or financial position 

 

the companys 2009 and 2010 us federal income tax returns are currently under examination and the completion of the field examination is expected in 2014 in connection with this examination the company received notices of proposed adjustments nopas in 2014 and expects to receive additional nopas within the next 12 months from the irs related to certain transfer pricing matters it is reasonably possible that the receipt of these future nopas will provide new information that causes the company to reassess the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits recorded while the company cannot estimate the impact that new information may have on our unrecognized tax benefit balance we believe that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined under topic 740  income taxes of the accounting standards codification 

deferred us income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling 161 billion  related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates the temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the us if managements intentions change in the future deferred taxes may need to be provided 

effects of changing prices—inflation 

the company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively this ability is because of rapid inventory turnover the ability to adjust menu prices cost controls and substantial property holdings many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation 

reconciliation of returns on incremental invested capital 

roiic is a measure reviewed by management over oneyear and threeyear time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of our markets the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital this measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation the numerator is the company’s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period 

the denominator is the weightedaverage cash used for investing activities during the applicable oneor threeyear period the weightedaverage cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis these weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter’s investing activities to incremental operating income for example fourth quarter 2013  investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income 125 of fourth quarter 2013  investing activities are included in the oneyear and threeyear calculations in contrast fourth quarter 2012  is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago and therefore have a fullyear impact on 2013  operating income with little or no impact to the base period 875 and 1000 of fourth quarter 2012  investing activities are included in the oneyear and threeyear calculations respectively management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average 

the reconciliations to the most comparable measurements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us for the numerator and denominator of the oneyear and threeyear roiic are as follows

 companyoperated restaurants have no backlog orders 

  

 no material portion of the business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the us government 

  

 mcdonald’s restaurants compete with international national regional and local retailers of food products the company competes on the basis of price convenience service menu variety and product quality in a highly fragmented global restaurant industry 

in measuring the company’s competitive position management reviews data compiled by euromonitor international a leading source of market data with respect to the global restaurant industry the company’s primary competition which management refers to as the informal eating out ieo segment includes the following restaurant categories defined by euromonitor international quickservice eating establishments casual dining fullservice restaurants 100 home deliverytakeaway providers street stalls or kiosks specialist coffee shops juicesmoothie bars and selfservice cafeterias the ieo segment excludes establishments that primarily serve alcohol and fullservice restaurants other than casual dining 

based on data from euromonitor international the global ieo segment was composed of approximately 70 million  outlets and generated 105 trillion  in annual sales in 2011  the most recent year for which data is available mcdonald’s systemwide 2011 restaurant business accounted for approximately 05  of those outlets and about 8  of the sales 

management also on occasion benchmarks mcdonald’s against the entire restaurant industry including the ieo segment defined above and all other fullservice restaurants based on data from euromonitor international the restaurant industry was composed of approximately 148 million  outlets and generated about 211 trillion  in annual sales in 2011  mcdonald’s systemwide restaurant business accounted for approximately 02  of those outlets and about 4  of the sales 

 the company operates research and development facilities in the us europe and asia while research and development activities are important to the company’s business these expenditures are not material independent suppliers also conduct research activities that benefit the company its franchisees and suppliers collectively referred to as the system 

  

 increased focus by us and overseas governmental authorities on environmental matters is likely to lead to new governmental initiatives particularly in the area of climate change while we cannot predict the precise nature of these initiatives we expect that they may impact our business both directly and indirectly although the impact would likely vary by world region andor market we believe that adoption of new regulations may increase 

 

costs including for the company its franchisees and suppliers also there is a possibility that governmental initiatives or actual or perceived effects of changes in weather patterns or climate could have a direct impact on the operations of our restaurants or the operations of our suppliers in ways which we cannot predict at this time 

the company monitors developments related to environmental matters and plans to respond to governmental initiatives in a timely and appropriate manner at this time the company has already begun to undertake its own initiatives relating to preservation of the environment including the development of a means to monitor and reduce energy use in many of its markets 

  

 the company’s number of employees worldwide including companyoperated restaurant employees was approximately 440000  as of yearend 2012

 item 1a risk factors and cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements 

  

tableend

  

the information on this report includes forwardlooking statements about our plans and future performance including those under outlook for 2013 these statements use such words as “may” “will” “expect” “believe” and “plan” they reflect our expectations and speak only as of the date of this report we do not undertake to update them our expectations or the underlying assumptions may change or not be realized and you should not rely unduly on forwardlooking statements 

our business and execution of our strategic plan the plan to win are subject to risks the most important of these is whether we can remain relevant to our customers and a brand they trust meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment the ieo segment of the restaurant industry although largely mature in our major markets is highly fragmented and competitive the ieo segment has been flat or contracting in many of our markets including some of our major markets due to unfavorable global economic conditions and this environment is expected to continue persistently high unemployment rates in many of these markets and declining economic growth rates or recessionary conditions in some of them have also increased consumer focus on value and heightened pricing sensitivity combined with pressure on labor and occupancy costs and volatility in commodity prices as well as aggressive competitive activity these circumstances affect restaurant sales and are expected to continue to pressure margins during 2013 in all of our geographic segments we have the added challenge of the cultural and regulatory differences that exist within and among the more than 100 countries where we operate initiatives we undertake may not have universal appeal among different segments of our customer base and can drive unanticipated changes in guest counts and customer perceptions our operations plans and results are also affected by regulatory and similar initiatives around the world notably the focus on nutritional content and the production processing and preparation of food “from field to front counter” as well as industry marketing practices 

these risks can have an impact both in the near and longterm and are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe are most likely to affect our performance 

our ability to remain a relevant and trusted brand and to increase sales and profits depends largely on how well we execute the plan to win and our global priorities 

the plan to win addresses the key drivers of our business and results  people products place price and promotion  and we are focused on our three global priorities that represent the greatest opportunities under our plan to win optimizing our menu modernizing the customer experience and broadening accessibility to our brand the quality of our execution depends mainly on the following 



 

operating promotional and capitalintensive initiatives and the potential impact on us if they experience food safety or other operational problems or project a brand image inconsistent with our values particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited by law or otherwise costly to exercise or subject to litigation

threaten boycotts or other actions involving us or our suppliers 

 our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions and the prolonged challenging economic environment can be expected to continue to pressure our results 

our results of operations are substantially affected by economic conditions both globally and in local markets and conditions can also vary substantially by market the current global environment has been characterized by persistently weak economies high unemployment rates inflationary pressures and volatility in financial markets many major economies both advanced and developing are also facing significant economic issues these include in the us concerns about the federal deficit and the potential adverse effects of the automatic spending cuts that will become effective in early 2013 absent further legislation the eurozone debt crisis continues to depress consumer and business confidence and spending in many markets important markets in asia which have been key drivers of global growth have been experiencing declining growth rates uncertainty about the longterm investment environment could further depress capital investment and economic activity 

these conditions are adversely affecting sales andor guest counts in many of our markets including some of our major markets to mitigate their impact we have intensified our focus on value as a driver of guest counts through menu pricing and promotional actions these actions have adversely affected our margin percent and margins will remain under pressure the key factors that can affect our operations plans and results in this environment are the following 



 

 increasing legal and regulatory complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways 

our legal and regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance litigation and similar risks that affect our operations and results in material ways in many of our markets including the united states and europe we are subject to increasing regulation which has increased our cost of doing business in developing markets we face the risks associated with new and untested laws and judicial systems among the more important regulatory and litigation risks we face and must manage are the following

defense costs which vary from period to period depending on the number nature and procedural status of pending proceedings the cost and other effects of settlements or judgments which may require us to make disclosures or take other actions that may affect perceptions of our brand and products and the scope and terms of insurance or indemnification protections that we may have 

 the trading volatility and price of our common stock may be affected by many factors 

many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects the most important of these some of which are outside our control are the following 



 

the principal trading market for our common stock and media reports and commentary about economic or other matters even when the matter in question does not directly relate to our business 

 our results and prospects can be adversely affected by events such as severe weather conditions natural disasters hostilities and social unrest among others 

severe weather conditions natural disasters hostilities and social unrest terrorist activities health epidemics or pandemics or expectations about them can adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels or other factors that affect our results and prospects such as commodity costs our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to certain of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully

overview 

description of the business 

the company franchises and operates mcdonald’s restaurants of the 34480  restaurants in 119  countries at yearend 2012  27882  were franchised or licensed including 19869  franchised to conventional franchisees 4350  licensed to developmental licensees and 3663  licensed to foreign affiliates affiliates—primarily japan and 6598  were operated by the company under our conventional franchise arrangement franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment signs seating and décor of their restaurant business and by reinvesting in the business over time the company owns the land and building or secures longterm leases for both companyoperated and conventional franchised restaurant sites this maintains longterm occupancy rights helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees in certain circumstances the company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants under our developmental license arrangement licensees provide capital for the entire business including the real estate interest and the company has no capital invested in addition the company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market 

we view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and believe franchising is important to delivering great locallyrelevant customer experiences and driving profitability however directly operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and is essential to providing company personnel with restaurant operations experience in our companyoperated restaurants and in collaboration with franchisees we further develop and refine operating standards marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants we continually review and as appropriate adjust our mix of companyoperated and franchised or licensed conventional franchised developmental licensed and foreign affiliated restaurants to help optimize overall performance 

the company’s revenues consist of sales by companyoperated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments and initial fees revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales and generally include initial fees fees vary by type of site amount of company investment if any and local business conditions these fees along with occupancy and operating rights are stipulated in franchiselicense agreements that generally have 20year terms 

the business is managed as distinct geographic segments significant reportable segments include the united states us europe and asiapacific middle east and africa apmea in addition throughout this report we present “other countries  corporate” that includes operations in canada and latin america as well as corporate activities the us europe and apmea segments account for 32  39  and 23  of total revenues respectively the united kingdom uk france and germany collectively account for 51 of europe’s revenues and china australia and japan a 50owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method collectively account for 56 of apmea’s revenues these six markets along with the us and canada are referred to as “major markets” throughout this report and comprise 70  of total revenues 

in analyzing business trends management considers a variety of performance and financial measures including 

 

comparable sales and comparable guest count growth systemwide sales growth and returns 

 mcdonald’s reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days the number of weekdays and weekend days in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales and guest counts the company refers to these impacts as calendar shifttrading day adjustments in addition the timing of holidays can impact comparable sales and guest counts these impacts vary geographically due to consumer spending patterns and have the greatest effect on monthly comparable sales and guest counts while the annual impacts are typically minimal 

 strategic direction and financial performance 

the strength of the alignment between the company its franchisees and suppliers collectively referred to as the system has been key to mcdonalds success this business model enables mcdonalds to consistently deliver locallyrelevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve in addition it facilitates our ability to identify implement and scale innovative ideas that meet customers changing needs and preferences

mcdonalds customerfocused plan to win plan provides a common framework for our global business while allowing for local adaptation through the execution of multiple initiatives surrounding the five pillars of our plan—people products place price and promotion—we have enhanced the restaurant experience for customers worldwide and grown global comparable sales and guest counts in each of the last nine years this plan combined with financial discipline has delivered strong results for our shareholders since its inception to measure our performance as we continue to build the business we have the following longterm average annual constant currency financial targets 

 prior to 2012 we exceeded each of these financial targets every year since the plans implementation in 2003 after adjusting for the loss in 2007 from the latin america developmental license transaction these targets have enabled us to make the best decisions for the longterm benefit of our shareholders and we believe they remain realistic and sustainable for a company of our size 

in 2012 systemwide sales growth was 3 5 in constant currencies operating income growth was 1 4 in constant currencies oneyear roiic was 154 and threeyear roiic was 286 see reconciliation on page 24 persistent global economic headwinds heightened competitive activity and inflationary costs impacted results in addition planned strategic decisions such as the 2012 london olympics sponsorship investing in technology and the biennial worldwide owneroperator convention also impacted results 

in 2012 we continued to focus on customers needs and remained aligned on our plan and the three global growth priorities of optimizing our menu modernizing the customer experience and broadening accessibility to our brand we believe these priorities are relevant and actionable and combined with our competitive advantages will drive longterm sustainable growth initiatives supporting these priorities resonated with customers and drove increases in global comparable sales and guest counts of 31 and 16 respectively despite challenging economies and a relatively flat or declining informal eating out ieo segment in most markets in 2012 we continued to grow market share in the us europe and apmea amid a more competitive global environment and a slight decline in our fourth quarter comparable guest counts 

comparable sales are impacted by guest counts product mix shifts and menu pricing specific menu pricing actions across our system reflect local market conditions as well as other factors notably food away from home and food at home inflation indices in our companyoperated restaurants we manage menu board prices to ensure value at all price points increase profitability and mitigate inflation all while trying to grow guest counts in order to accomplish these objectives we utilize a strategic pricing tool that balances price and product mix franchisees also have access to and many utilize this strategic pricing tool in general we believe franchisees employ a similar pricing strategy we look to optimize product mix by utilizing a menu with entrypoint value core premium and promotional offerings we also introduce new products to meet customers needs which can expand average check and increase guest counts in 2012 average prices increased at companyoperated restaurants in each area of the world although increases varied by market and region 

us 

in the us comparable sales increased for the tenth consecutive year rising 33 in 2012 while comparable guest counts rose 

 

19 these results were achieved despite only modest growth in the ieo segment and heightened competitive activity in the second half of the year we experienced softer performance therefore we adjusted our plans to reenergize our allday everyday value offerings while providing the menu variety customers expect from mcdonalds 

in 2012 we continued to highlight beverages value breakfast and our classic core favorites we expanded our mccafé beverage offerings with the chocolate chip frappé and cherry berry chiller limitedtime offers such as chicken mcbites and the cheddar bacon onion premium sandwiches complemented our core menu offerings 

modernizing the customer experience continued through our major remodeling initiative which provides contemporary restaurant designs and retailing efforts the enhanced appearance and functionality of our restaurants deliver a more relevant experience for our customers over 900 existing restaurants were remodeled during 2012 with the majority adding drivethru capacity to capture additional guest counts 

we broadened the accessibility of our convenient locations through extended hours and efficient drivethru service more than half of our restaurants use some form of multiple order points to maximize drivethru capacity including 1500 with handheld order takers to help improve customer service times to further build on our competitive advantage we focused on operations excellence initiatives to drive customer satisfaction as we strive to deliver fast accurate and friendly service with every order 

europe 

in europe comparable sales rose 24 marking the ninth consecutive year of comparable sales increases while guest counts declined 05 while low consumer confidence continues to negatively affect overall retail sales and the ieo segment we outperformed the market and grew market share major contributors to comparable sales were the uk and russia despite ongoing economic challenges the segments priority remains growing the overall business by balancing a strong focus on our unique value offerings ongoing premium product innovation and new products 

europe continued to see the benefit of providing a relevant contemporary customer experience and completed almost 750 restaurant reimages by the end of 2012 over 90 of restaurant interiors and approximately 50 of exteriors had been reimaged europe also invested in a rollout of a new pointofsale system which allows us to continue to expand our menu offerings and improve order accuracy by the end of 2012 over 2200 restaurants had deployed this system 

we expanded our coffee business and have over 1600 mccafé locations which in europe are generally separate areas inside the restaurants that serve specialty coffees desserts and snacks in addition we increased our accessibility and convenience with extended operating hours selforder kiosks optimized drivethrus and opened over 250 new restaurants 

apmea 

in apmea comparable sales rose 14 and comparable guest counts rose 22 despite a challenging year of economic pressures partly due to japans uneven recovery and chinas slower economic growth positive performance was driven by china australia and many other markets unique value platforms great tasting premium menu selections locallyrelevant menu variety and convenience and service enhancements differentiated the mcdonalds experience australia launched the “loose change menu” which is a branded affordability menu while china focused on breakfast lunch and dinner value platforms value initiatives were balanced with midtier offers such as bubble tea in china and premium limitedtime offers such as the serious lamb burger and wrap in australia 

  

mcdonalds corporation 2012 annual report 11 

our breakfast business has expanded and is offered in approximately 75 of apmea restaurants desserts continued to play a meaningful role particularly in china where we remain one of the largest ice cream retailers 

we opened over 750 new restaurants in apmea of which over 250 were in china where we have made significant progress toward our goal of 2000 restaurants by the end of 2013 nearly twothirds of apmea restaurants are offering some form of extended operating hours and over 5400 restaurants are open 24 hours delivery is offered in many apmea markets and is now available in over 1700 restaurants including nearly 550 in china 

since japans natural disaster in march of 2011 the economy remains a challenge despite a declining ieo segment mcdonalds is gaining market share through a value platform of 100 250 and 500 yen offerings and family sharing boxes such as 15piece chicken mcnuggets japan augmented its value platform with strategic couponing to encourage addon and extra value meal purchases 

consolidated 

globally our approach to offering affordable value to our customers is complemented by a focus on driving operating efficiencies and leveraging our scale supply chain infrastructure and our suppliers risk management practices to manage costs we were able to execute our strategies in every area of the world grow comparable sales and control selling general and administrative expenses however in 2012 we faced top and bottomline pressures some a result of planned strategic decisions and others driven by the external environment as a result combined operating margin operating income as a percent of total revenues was 312 in 2012 down 04 percentage points as compared to 2011 

in 2012 cash from operations was nearly 70 billion our substantial cash flow strong credit rating and continued access to credit provide us flexibility to fund capital expenditures as well as return cash to shareholders capital expenditures of approximately 30 billion were invested in our business primarily to reimage existing restaurants and open new restaurants across the system over 1400 restaurants were opened and about 2400 existing locations were reimaged in addition we returned 55 billion to shareholders consisting of 29 billion in dividends and 26 billion in share repurchases 

cash from operations continues to benefit from our heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income received from owneroperators is a stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs in addition the franchise business model is less capital intensive than the companyowned model we believe locallyowned and operated restaurants maximize brand performance and are at the core of our competitive advantages making mcdonalds not just a global brand but also a locally– relevant one

while changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results mcdonald’s mitigates exposures where practical by financing in local currencies hedging certain foreigndenominated cash flows and purchasing goods and services in local currencies 

in 2012 foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results primarily due to the weaker euro along with most other currencies in 2011 foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results driven by the stronger euro and australian dollar as well as most other currencies in 2010 foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results driven by stronger global currencies primarily the australian dollar and canadian dollar partly offset by the weaker euro

the company repurchased 281 million  shares of its stock for 26 billion  in 2012  and 419 million  shares of its stock for 34 billion  in 2011  driving reductions in weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in both periods 



revenues 

the company’s revenues consist of sales by companyoperated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments and initial fees revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales and generally include initial fees 

in 2012  and 2011  constant currency revenue growth was driven primarily by positive comparable sales as well as expansion 



in the us the increase in revenues in 2012 was primarily due to positive comparable sales everyday value offerings menu variety and the enhanced customer experience due to reimaging contributed positively to results despite broad competitive activity revenues in 2011 were positively impacted by the ongoing appeal of our iconic core products and the success of new products including additions to the mccafé beverage line as well as continued focus on everyday value convenience and modernizing the customer experience 

europe’s constant currency increases in revenues in 2012 and 2011 were primarily driven by positive comparable sales in the uk and russia the segments two largest companyoperated restaurant markets as well as expansion in russia revenues in 2011 also benefited from comparable sales increases in france and germany 

 

in apmea the constant currency increase in revenues in 2012 was driven by positive comparable sales in china australia and many other markets the constant currency increase in revenues in 2011 was primarily driven by comparable sales increases in china and most other markets expansion primarily in china also contributed to revenue growth in both periods

franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the company but are the basis on which the company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base the following table presents franchised sales and the related increasesdecreases 

franchised sales 



  restaurant margins 

 franchised margin dollars represent revenues from franchised restaurants less the company’s occupancy costs rent and depreciation associated with those sites franchised margin dollars represented about twothirds of the combined restaurant margins in 2012  2011  and 2010  franchised margin dollars increased   205 million  or 3   6  in constant currencies in 2012  and 768 million  or 12   9  in constant currencies in 2011  positive comparable sales were the primary driver of the constant currency growth in franchised margin dollars in both years 

 

franchised margins 

in the us the franchised margin percent was flat in 2012 as comparable sales performance was offset by higher depreciation related to reimaging the increase in 2011 was primarily due to positive comparable sales partly offset by higher occupancy expenses 

in europe the franchised margin percent decrease in 2012 reflected positive comparable sales and higher occupancy costs the increase in 2011 was primarily due to positive comparable sales partly offset by higher occupancy expenses 

16     mcdonalds corporation 2012 annual report 

in apmea the franchised margin percent decrease in 2012 was primarily due to australia which was partly impacted by the 2012 change in classification of certain amounts from revenues to restaurant occupancy expenses although the change in classification resulted in a decrease to the franchised margin percentage there was no impact on the reported franchised margin dollars the increase in 2011 was primarily due to a contractual escalation in the royalty rate for japan in addition to positive comparable sales in most markets partly offset by a negative impact from the strengthening of the australian dollar 

the franchised margin percent in apmea and other countries  corporate is higher relative to the us and europe due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed andor affiliated restaurants where the company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs 

 companyoperated margin dollars represent sales by companyoperated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants companyoperated margin dollars decreased 76 million or 2 increased 1 in constant currencies in 2012 and increased 282 million or 9 5 in constant currencies in 2011 in 2012 companyoperated margin dollars were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation of 97 million primarily in europe on a constant currency basis the increase in companyoperated margin dollars was due to positive performance in europe offset by lower results in apmea and the us as positive comparable sales were more than offset by higher costs the growth in companyoperated margin dollars in 2011 was driven by positive comparable sales partly offset by higher costs primarily commodity costs in all segments foreign currency translation also had a positive impact on results 

companyoperated margins 



in the us the companyoperated margin percent decreased in 2012 primarily due to higher commodity and labor costs partly offset by positive comparable sales the margin percent decreased in 2011 due to higher commodity and occupancy costs partly offset by positive comparable sales 

europe’s companyoperated margin percent decreased in 2012 primarily due to higher labor and commodity costs across several markets despite positive comparable sales in russia and the uk the margin percent decreased in 2011 as higher commodity labor and occupancy costs were partly offset by positive comparable sales 

in apmea the companyoperated margin percent in 2012 decreased primarily due to higher labor and occupancy costs partly offset by positive comparable sales the margin percent decreased in 2011 as higher commodity labor and occupancy costs were partly offset by positive comparable sales acceleration of new restaurant openings in china negatively impacted the 

 

margin percent in both periods similar to other markets new restaurants in china initially open with lower margins that grow significantly over time 

supplemental information regarding companyoperated restaurants 

we continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance profits and returns in most cases franchising is the best way to achieve these goals but as previously stated companyoperated restaurants are also important to our success 

we report results for companyoperated restaurants based on their sales less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs we report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues less associated occupancy costs for this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure we do not specifically allocate selling general and administrative expenses and other operating income expenses to companyoperated or franchised restaurants other operating items that relate to the companyoperated restaurants generally include gainslosses on sales of restaurant businesses and writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements 

we believe the following information about companyoperated restaurants in our most significant segments provides an additional perspective on this business management of the company considers this information when evaluating restaurant ownership mix subject to other relevant considerations 

the following table seeks to illustrate the two components of our companyoperated margins the first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations which we refer to as “store operating margin” the second relates to the value of our brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and royalties we refer to this component as “brandreal estate margin” both companyoperated and conventional franchised restaurants are charged rent and royalties although rent and royalties for companyoperated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation rent and royalties for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales and the actual rent percentage varies depending on the level of mcdonald’s investment in the restaurant royalty rates may also vary by market 

as shown in the following table in disaggregating the components of our companyoperated margins certain costs with respect to companyoperated restaurants are reflected in brandreal estate margin those costs consist of rent payable by mcdonald’s to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of occupancy  other operating expenses recorded in the consolidated statement of income store operating margins reflect rent and royalty expenses and those amounts are accounted for as income in calculating brandreal estate margin 

while we believe that the following information provides a perspective in evaluating our companyoperated business it is not intended as a measure of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating income or restaurant margins as reported by the company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us in particular as noted previously we do not allocate selling general and administrative expenses to our companyoperated business however we believe that about 50000 per restaurant on average is the typical cost to support this business in the us the actual costs in markets outside the 

us will vary depending on local circumstances and the organizational structure of the market these costs reflect the indirect services we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant

selling general  administrative expenses 

consolidated selling general and administrative expenses increased 3 4 in constant currencies in 2012 and increased 3 flat in constant currencies in 2011 the growth rate for 2012 was primarily due to higher employee costs the 2012 london olympics sponsorship higher technology related costs and the 2012 worldwide owneroperator convention partly offset by lower incentivebased compensation the growth rate for 2011 was flat as higher employee and other costs were offset by lower incentivebased compensation and costs in 2010 related to the vancouver olympics and the company’s 2010 worldwide owneroperator convention

capital expenditures invested in major markets excluding japan represented about 70 of the total in 2012 2011 and 2010 japan is accounted for under the equity method and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts 

capital expenditures   



 new restaurant investments in all years were concentrated in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for longterm growth average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market these costs which include land buildings and equipment are managed through the use of optimallysized restaurants construction and design efficiencies and leveraging best practices although the company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened total development costs consisting of land buildings and equipment for new traditional mcdonald’s restaurants in the us averaged approximately 29  million in 2012 

the company owned approximately 45 of the land and about 70 of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at yearend 2012 and 2011 

share repurchases and dividends 

for the last three years the company returned a total of 165 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends 

shares repurchased and dividends   



 

in september 2009 the company’s board of directors approved a 10 billion share repurchase program with no specified expiration date 2009 program as most of the amount authorized under the 2009 program was utilized the company’s board of directors terminated the 2009 program and replaced it with a new share repurchase program effective august 1 2012 that authorizes the purchase of up to 10 billion of the company’s outstanding common stock with no specified expiration date in 2012 approximately 84 million shares were repurchased for  748 million  under the new program 

the company has paid dividends on its common stock for 37 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year the 2012 full year dividend of  287  per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of 070 per share with an increase to 077 per share paid in the fourth quarter this 10 increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a 308 per share annual dividend and reflects the company’s confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow as in the past future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs and will be declared at the discretion of the company’s board of directors 



total assets and returns 

total assets increased 24 billion or 7 in 2012 excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates total assets increased 20 billion in 2012 over 75 of total assets were in major markets at yearend 2012 net property and equipment increased 18 billion in 2012 and represented about 70 of total assets at year end excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates net property and equipment increased 14 billion primarily due to capital expenditures partly offset by depreciation 

operating income is used to compute return on average assets while net income is used to calculate return on average common equity monthend balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity 



in 2012 return on average assets and return on average common equity decreased due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation primarily on operating income and net income in 2011 return on average assets and return on average common equity benefited from strong global operating results and the positive impact of foreign currency translation operating income as reported does not include interest income however cash balances are included in average assets the inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by about two percentage points for all years presented

fitch standard  poor’s and moody’s currently rate with a stable outlook the company’s commercial paper f1 a1 and p1 respectively and its longterm debt a a and a2 respectively 

certain of the company’s debt obligations contain crossacceleration provisions and restrictions on company and subsidiary mortgages and the longterm debt of certain subsidiaries there are no provisions in the company’s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the company’s business under existing authorization from the company’s board of directors at december 31 2012 the company had 54 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds including through i public or private offering of debt securities ii direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions and iii other forms of indebtedness in addition to debt securities available through a mediumterm notes program registered with the us securities and exchange commission sec and a global mediumterm notes program the company has 15 billion available under committed line of credit agreements as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the us and global markets see debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k debt maturing in 2013 is approximately 690 million of longterm corporate debt in 2013 the company expects to issue commercial paper and longterm debt to refinance this maturing debt as of december 31 2012 the company also had 581 million of foreign currency borrowings outstanding primarily under uncommitted line of credit agreements 

the company uses major capital markets bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense the company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring redeeming and repurchasing debt terminating swaps and using derivatives the company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes all swaps are overthecounter instruments 

 

in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations the company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated the company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties intercompany financings and longterm investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates this reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders’ equity total foreign currencydenominated debt was 49 billion and 50 billion for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively in addition where practical the company’s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges see summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives 

the company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below or aggregate exposures exceed certain contractual limits at december 31 2012 neither the company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position other than on hedges of certain of the company’s supplemental benefit plan liabilities where our counterparty was required to post collateral on its liability position 

the company’s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies the company’s largest net asset exposures defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities at year end were as follows 

foreign currency net asset exposures 



the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the company’s results of operations cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments the interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10 in the same direction relative to the us dollar on all financial instruments however the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the us based on the results of these analyses of the company’s financial instruments neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2012 levels nor a 10 adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2012 levels would materially affect the company’s results of operations cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments 

liquidity 

the company has significant operations outside the united states where we earn over 60 of our operating income a significant portion of these historical earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the company 

22     mcdonalds corporation 2012 annual report 

has made and will continue to make substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations accordingly no us federal or state income taxes have been provided on the undistributed foreign earnings the companys cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately 21 billion as of december 31 2012  we do not intend nor do we foresee a need to repatriate these funds 

consistent with prior years we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents domestic cash flows from operations annual repatriation of a portion of the current periods foreign earnings and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating investing and financing activities we also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating investing and financing activities 

in the future should we require more capital to fund activities in the united states than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods earnings from foreign jurisdictions this could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the future 

while the likelihood is remote to the extent foreign cash is available the company could also elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise the company may be subject to additional us income taxes net of an adjustment for foreign tax credits which could result in a use of cash this could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the period in which such a determination is made to repatriate prior period foreign earnings refer to the income taxes note to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for further information related to our income taxes and the undistributed earnings of the companys foreign subsidiaries 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the company has longterm contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations related to both companyoperated and franchised restaurants and debt obligations in addition the company has longterm revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements cash provided by operations including cash provided by these franchise arrangements along with the company’s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations the following table summarizes the company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the company under existing franchise arrangements as of december 31 2012 see discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for further details 





 

the company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to i make taxdeferred contributions and ii receive companyprovided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of irs limitations at december 31 2012 total liabilities for the supplemental plans were 493 million and total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were 482 million  

there are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction inventory energy marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business the amounts related to these commitments are not significant to the company’s financial position such commitments are generally shorter term in nature and will be funded from operating cash flows 



critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions 

the company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

 property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straightline basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets taking into account anticipated technological or other changes the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors economic factors and industry trends if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or writeoffs in future periods 

 the company has a sharebased compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equitybased incentives including stock options and restricted stock units rsus to employees and nonemployee directors the expense for these equitybased incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period 

the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closedform pricing model the pricing model requires assumptions which impact the assumed fair value including the expected life of the stock option the riskfree interest rate expected volatility of the company’s stock over the expected 

  

mcdonalds corporation 2012 annual report 23 

life and the expected dividend yield the company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants sharebased compensation expense will fluctuate in future years the fair value of each rsu granted is equal to the market price of the company’s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period 

 longlived assets including goodwill are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in assessing the recoverability of the company’s longlived assets the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the company’s experience and knowledge of its operations these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions operating costs inflation competition and consumer and demographic trends a key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales if the company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future the company may be required to record impairment charges based on the annual goodwill impairment test conducted in the fourth quarter the company does not have any reporting units defined as each individual country with goodwill currently at risk of impairment 

 in the ordinary course of business the company is subject to proceedings lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors customers employees franchisees government agencies intellectual property shareholders and suppliers the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses a determination of the amount of accrual required if any for these contingencies is made after 

careful analysis of each matter the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters the company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 

 the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies including the sale of appreciated assets in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if these estimates and assumptions change in the future the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance this could result in a charge to or an increase in income in the period such determination is made 

the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter in 2012 the internal revenue service irs completed its examination of the companys us federal income tax returns for 2007 and 2008 the company and the irs reached an agreement on adjustments that had been previously proposed by the irs the agreement did not have a material impact on the companys cash flows results of operations or financial position the companys 2009 and 2010 us federal income tax returns 

 

are currently under examination and the completion of the field examination is expected in 2013 

deferred us income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling 148 billion  related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates the temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the us if managements intentions change in the future deferred taxes may need to be provided 

effects of changing prices—inflation 

the company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively this ability is because of rapid inventory turnover the ability to adjust menu prices cost controls and substantial property holdings many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation 

reconciliation of returns on incremental invested capital 

roiic is a measure reviewed by management over oneyear and threeyear time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital this measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation the numerator is the company’s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period 

the denominator is the weightedaverage cash used for investing activities during the applicable oneor threeyear period the weightedaverage cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis these weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter’s investing activities to incremental operating income for example fourth quarter 2012  investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income 125 of fourth quarter 2012  investing activities are included in the oneyear and threeyear calculations in contrast fourth quarter 2011  is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago and therefore have a fullyear impact on 2012  operating income with little or no impact to the base period 875 and 1000 of fourth quarter 2011  investing activities are included in the oneyear and threeyear calculations respectively management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average 

the reconciliations to the most comparable measurements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us for the numerator and denominator of the oneyear and threeyear roiic are as follows

 mcdonald’s restaurants compete with international national regional and local retailers of food products the company competes on the basis of price convenience service menu variety and product quality in a highly fragmented global restaurant industry 

in measuring the company’s competitive position management reviews data compiled by euromonitor international a leading source of market data with respect to the global restaurant industry the company’s primary competition which management refers to as the informal eating out ieo segment includes the following restaurant categories defined by euromonitor international quickservice eating establishments casual dining fullservice restaurants 100 home deliverytakeaway providers street stalls or kiosks specialist coffee shops juicesmoothie bars and selfservice cafeterias the ieo segment excludes establishments that primarily serve alcohol and fullservice restaurants other than casual dining 

based on data from euromonitor international the global ieo segment was composed of approximately 65 million outlets and generated 933 billion in annual sales in 2010 the most recent year for which data is available mcdonald’s systemwide 2010 restaurant business accounted for approximately 05 of those outlets and about 8 of the sales 

management also on occasion benchmarks mcdonald’s against the entire restaurant industry including the ieo segment defined above and all other fullservice restaurants based on data from euromonitor international the restaurant industry was composed of approximately 137 million outlets and generated about 186 trillion in annual sales in 2010 mcdonald’s systemwide restaurant business accounted for approximately 02 of those outlets and about 4 of the sales 

 the company operates research and development facilities in the us europe and asia while research and development activities are important to the company’s business these expenditures are not material independent suppliers also conduct research activities that benefit the company its franchisees and suppliers collectively referred to as the system 

 

 increased focus by us and overseas governmental authorities on environmental matters is likely to lead to new governmental initiatives particularly in the area of climate change while we cannot predict the precise nature of these initiatives we expect that they may impact our business both directly and indirectly although the impact would likely vary by world region andor market we believe that adoption of new regulations may increase costs including for the company its franchisees and suppliers also there is a possibility that governmental initiatives or actual or perceived effects of changes in weather patterns or climate could have a direct impact on the operations of our restaurants or the operations of our suppliers in ways which we cannot predict at this time 

the company monitors developments related to environmental matters and plans to respond to governmental initiatives in a timely and appropriate manner at this time the company has already begun to undertake its own initiatives relating to preservation of the environment including the development of means to monitor and reduce energy use in many of its markets 

 

 the company’s number of employees worldwide including companyoperated restaurant employees was approximately 420000 as of yearend 2011

our business and execution of our strategic plan the plan to win are subject to risks the most important of these is whether we can remain relevant to our customers and a brand they trust meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment the ieo segment of the restaurant industry although largely mature in our major markets is highly fragmented and competitive the ieo segment has been contracting in many markets including some major markets due to unfavorable economic conditions and this may continue persistently high unemployment rates in many markets have also increased consumer focus on value and heightened pricing sensitivity combined with increasing pressure on commodity and labor costs these circumstances affect restaurant sales and margin growth despite the strength of our brand and value proposition we have the added challenge of the cultural economic and regulatory differences that exist within and among the more than 100 countries where we operate initiatives we undertake may not have universal appeal among different segments of our customer base and can drive unanticipated changes in guest counts and customer perceptions our operations plans and results are also affected by regulatory and similar initiatives around the world notably the focus on nutritional content and the production processing and preparation of food “from field to front counter” as well as industry marketing practices 

these risks can have an impact both in the near and longterm and are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe are most likely to affect our performance 

our ability to remain a relevant and trusted brand and to increase sales and profits depends largely on how well we execute the plan to win 

the plan to win addresses the key drivers of our business and results—people products place price and promotion the quality of our execution depends mainly on the following

overview 

description of the business 

the company franchises and operates mcdonald’s restaurants of the 33510 restaurants in 119 countries at yearend 2011 27075 were franchised or licensed including 19527 franchised to conventional franchisees 3929 licensed to developmental licensees and 3619 licensed to foreign affiliates affiliates—primarily japan and 6435 were operated by the company under our conventional franchise arrangement franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment signs seating and décor of their restaurant business and by reinvesting in the business over time the company owns the land and building or secures longterm leases for both companyoperated and conventional franchised restaurant sites this maintains longterm occupancy rights helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees in certain circumstances the company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants under our developmental license arrangement licensees provide capital for the entire business including the real estate interest and the company has no capital invested in addition the company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate andor franchise restaurants within a market 

we view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and believe franchising is important to delivering great locallyrelevant customer experiences and driving profitability however directly operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and is essential to providing company personnel with restaurant operations experience in our companyoperated restaurants and in collaboration with franchisees we further develop and refine operating standards marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants we continually review and as appropriate adjust our mix of companyoperated and franchised conventional franchised developmental licensed and foreign affiliated restaurants to help optimize overall performance 

the company’s revenues consist of sales by companyoperated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments and initial fees revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales and generally include initial fees fees vary by type of site amount of company investment if any and local business conditions these fees along with occupancy and operating rights are stipulated in franchiselicense agreements that generally have 20year terms 

the business is managed as distinct geographic segments significant reportable segments include the united states us europe and asiapacific middle east and africa apmea in addition throughout this report we present “other countries  corporate” that includes operations in canada and latin america as well as corporate activities the us europe and apmea segments account for 32 40 and 22 of total revenues respectively the united kingdom uk france and germany 

collectively account for over 50 of europe’s revenues and china australia and japan a 50owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method collectively account for over 55 of apmea’s revenues these six markets along with the us and canada are referred to as “major markets” throughout this report and comprise approximately 70 of total revenues 

in analyzing business trends management considers a variety of performance and financial measures including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth systemwide sales growth and returns 

 

  

 mcdonald’s reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days the number of weekdays and weekend days in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales and guest counts the company refers to these impacts as calendar shifttrading day adjustments in addition the timing of holidays can impact comparable sales and guest counts these impacts vary geographically due to consumer spending patterns and have the greatest effect on monthly comparable sales and guest counts while the annual impacts are typically minimal

 strategic direction and financial performance 

the strength of the alignment between the company its franchisees and suppliers collectively referred to as the system has been key to mcdonald’s success this business model enables mcdonald’s to consistently deliver locallyrelevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve in addition it facilitates our ability to identify implement and scale innovative ideas that meet customers’ changing needs and preferences 

mcdonald’s customerfocused plan to win—which concentrates on being better not just bigger—provides a common framework for our global business while allowing for local adaptation through the execution of multiple initiatives surrounding the five elements of our plan to win—people products place price and promotion—we have enhanced the restaurant experience for customers worldwide and grown comparable sales and customer visits in each of the last eight years this plan combined with financial discipline has delivered strong results for our shareholders 

we have exceeded our longterm constant currency financial targets of average annual systemwide sales growth of 3 to 5 average annual operating income growth of 6 to 7 and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens every year since the plan’s implementation in 2003 after adjusting for the loss in 2007 from the latin america developmental license transaction given the size and scope of our global business we believe these financial targets are realistic and sustainable over time keeping us focused on making the best decisions for the longterm benefit of our system 

in 2011 we remained focused on customers’ needs and accelerated efforts within the plan to win where the greatest opportunity exists the company’s key global priorities of optimizing our menu modernizing the customer experience and broadening accessibility to our brand represent areas where we are intensifying our efforts to drive the business further initiatives supporting these priorities resonated with consumers driving increases in sales and customer visits despite challenging economies and a contracting informal eating out ieo segment in many markets as a result every area of the world contributed to 2011 global comparable sales and guest counts increasing 56 and 37 respectively 

specific menu pricing actions across our system reflect local market conditions as well as other factors notably the food away from home and food at home inflation indices in our companyoperated restaurants we manage menu board prices to ensure value at all price points increase profitability and mitigate inflation all while trying to maintain guest count momentum in order to accomplish these objectives we utilize a strategic pricing tool that balances price product mix and promotion franchisees also have access to and many utilize this strategic pricing tool in general we believe franchisees employ a similar pricing strategy in 2011 we increased average price at companyoperated restaurants in each area of the world although increases varied by market and region we look to optimize product mix by utilizing a menu with entrypoint value core premium and fourthtier offerings we also introduce new products that meet customer needs which can expand average check and increase guest counts 

in the us we grew sales guest counts and market share with comparable sales up for the ninth consecutive year rising 48 in 2011 while comparable guest counts rose 33 these results were achieved despite a slight decline in the ieo segment we remained focused on maximizing our core business while providing customers with affordable products and value throughout our menu including options available on the dollar menu at breakfast and the rest of the day we highlighted core menu items like chicken mcnuggets that featured new sauces breakfast products including our new fruit  maple oatmeal additions to the mccafé beverage line and limitedtime offerings such as the mcrib sandwich the national launch of the mccafé frozen strawberry lemonade and mango pineapple realfruit smoothie provided meaningful extensions to the mccafé beverage line convenient locations also continued to provide a competitive advantage with extended hours and efficient drivethru service modernizing the customer experience remained a focus with the expansion of our major remodeling program to enhance the appearance and functionality of our restaurants and make our restaurants more relevant to our customers’ daily lives over 900 existing restaurants were remodeled during 2011 with the majority adding drivethru capacity to capture additional guest counts we also completed our twoyear systemwide rollout of a new pointofsale system this allows us to continue expanding our menu offerings while making it easier for our crew to fulfill every order accurately 

in europe comparable sales rose 59 marking the eighth consecutive year of comparable sales increases and comparable guest counts rose 34 major contributors were the uk france russia and germany initiatives that helped drive our business included leveraging our tiered menu featuring everyday affordable prices menu variety including new and limitedtime offerings and reimaging over 900 restaurants we continue to expand our coffee business and have over 1500 mccafé locations which in europe are generally separate areas inside the restaurants that serve specialty coffees indulgent desserts and snacks we completed the rollout of the new drivethru customer order display system in over 4500 restaurants in addition we increased our accessibility and convenience with extended operating hours we offered new premium menu items such as the 1955 burger and expanded mcwraps across several european markets in many markets we have continued to offer a fourthtier platform—such as little tasters in the uk—a range of tasty and appealing items in smaller portion sizes finally we continued building customer trust in our brand through communications that emphasized the quality and origin of mcdonald’s food and our commitment to sustainable business practices 

in apmea our momentum continued with nearly every country delivering positive comparable sales led by china and australia comparable sales rose 47 and comparable guest counts rose 43 with performance driven by strategies emphasizing value breakfast convenience core menu extensions desserts and promotional food events australia launched a value lunch program that features meals at discounted price points for certain hours while china and japan concentrated on affordability by continuing their value lunch platforms new menu items such as realfruit smoothies and frappés in australia and the extension of the value breakfast program in china were popular with customers japan executed another successful us themed burger promotion and celebrated its 40 th anniversary by offering popular core menu items at reduced prices desserts 

 

  

mcdonald’s corporation annual report 2011 11 

continue to play a meaningful role as we seek to deliver on customers’ menu expectations through products such as the mcflurry and unique delivery storefronts like the dessert kiosks in china where we are now one of the largest ice cream retailers our breakfast business continues to evolve and is now offered in approximately 75 of apmea restaurants in japan rotational breakfast items including the chicken muffin and tuna muffin were offered during several months while australia launched new breakfast menu items such as bagel sandwiches nearly twothirds of apmea restaurants are now offering some form of extended operating hours and over 4600 restaurants are open 24 hours delivery is offered in many apmea markets and is now available in over 1500 restaurants including nearly 500 in china mcdonald’s japan was negatively impacted by the natural disaster last march and as a result continued to face some challenges throughout 2011 however we remain confident that the market will continue to drive longterm profitable growth 

our approach to offering affordable value to our customers is complemented by a focus on driving operating efficiencies and effectively managing restaurantlevel food and paper costs by leveraging our scale supply chain infrastructure and risk management practices our ability to execute our strategies in every area of the world grow comparable sales and control selling general  administrative expenses resulted in combined operating margin operating income as a percent of total revenues of 316 in 2011 an improvement of 06 percentage points over 2010 

in 2011 strong global sales and margin performance grew cash from operations which rose 808 million to 72 billion our substantial cash flow strong credit rating and continued access to credit provide us flexibility to fund capital expenditures and debt repayments as well as return cash to shareholders capital expenditures of approximately 27 billion were invested in our business primarily to open new restaurants and reimage existing restaurants across the system 1150 restaurants were opened and over 2500 existing locations were reimaged in addition we returned 60 billion to shareholders consisting of 34 billion in share repurchases and 26 billion in dividends 

cash from operations continues to benefit from our heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income received from owneroperators is a very stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs in addition the franchise business model is less capital intensive than the companyowned model we believe locallyowned and operated restaurants maximize brand performance and are at the core of our competitive advantages making mcdonald’s not just a global brand but also a locallyrelevant one

restaurant margins 

 

 franchised margin dollars represent revenues from franchised restaurants less the company’s occupancy costs rent and depreciation associated with those sites franchised margin dollars represented about twothirds of the combined restaurant margins in 2011 2010 and 2009 franchised margin dollars increased 768 million or 12 9 in constant currencies in 2011 and 479 million or 8 8 in constant currencies in 2010 positive comparable sales were the primary driver of the constant currency growth in franchised margin dollars in both years

higher occupancy costs europe’s franchised margin percent decreased in 2010 as positive comparable sales were more than offset by higher occupancy expenses the cost of strategic brand and sales building initiatives and the refranchising strategy 

in apmea the franchised margin percent increase in 2011 was primarily due to a contractual escalation in the royalty rate for japan in addition to positive comparable sales in most markets partly offset by a negative impact from the strengthening of the australian dollar the 2010 decrease was primarily driven by a negative impact from the strengthening of the australian dollar 

the franchised margin percent in apmea and other countries  corporate is higher relative to the us and europe due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed andor affiliated restaurants where the company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs 

 

 companyoperated margin dollars represent sales by companyoperated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants companyoperated margin dollars increased 282 million or 9 5 in constant currencies in 2011 and increased 366 million or 13 12 in constant currencies in 2010 the constant currency growth in companyoperated margin dollars in 2011 was driven by positive comparable sales partially offset by higher costs primarily commodity costs in all segments positive comparable sales and lower commodity costs were the primary drivers of the constant currency growth in companyoperated margin dollars in 2010

supplemental information regarding companyoperated restaurants 

we continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance profits and returns in most cases franchising is the best way to achieve these goals but as previously stated companyoperated restaurants are also important to our success 

we report results for companyoperated restaurants based on their sales less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs we report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues less associated occupancy costs for this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure we do not specifically allocate selling general  administrative expenses and other operating income expenses to companyoperated or franchised restaurants other operating items that relate to the companyoperated restaurants generally include gainslosses on sales of restaurant businesses and writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements 

we believe the following information about companyoperated restaurants in our most significant segments provides an additional perspective on this business management responsible for our companyoperated restaurants in these markets analyzes the companyoperated business on this basis to assess its performance management of the company also considers this information when evaluating restaurant ownership mix subject to other relevant considerations 

the following table seeks to illustrate the two components of our companyoperated margins the first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations which we refer to as “store operating margin” the second relates to the value of our brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and royalties we refer to this component as “brandreal estate margin” both companyoperated and conventional franchised restaurants are charged rent and royalties although rent and royalties for companyoperated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation rent and royalties for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales and the actual rent percentage varies depending on the level of mcdonald’s investment in the restaurant royalty rates may also vary by market 

as shown in the following table in disaggregating the components of our companyoperated margins certain costs with respect to companyoperated restaurants are reflected in brandreal estate margin those costs consist of rent payable by mcdonald’s to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of occupancy  other operating expenses recorded in the consolidated statement of income store operating margins reflect rent and royalty expenses and those amounts are accounted for as income in calculating brandreal estate margin 

while we believe that the following information provides a perspective in evaluating our companyoperated business it is not intended as a measure of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating income or restaurant margins as reported by the company in accordance with accounting principles 

 

  

mcdonald’s corporation annual report 2011 17 

generally accepted in the us in particular as noted previously we do not allocate selling general  administrative expenses to our companyoperated business however we believe that about 50000 per restaurant on average is the typical cost to support this business in the us the actual costs in markets outside the 

us will vary depending on local circumstances and the organizational structure of the market these costs reflect the indirect services we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant 

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

 

 

selling general  administrative expenses 

consolidated selling general  administrative expenses increased 3 flat in constant currencies in 2011 and increased 4 4 in constant currencies in 2010 the growth rate for 2011 was flat as higher employee and other costs were offset by lower incentive based compensation and costs in 2010 related to the vancouver olympics and the company’s biennial worldwide owneroperator convention the olympics and convention contributed to the increase in 2010

other matters 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions 

the company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

 

 property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straightline basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with 

 

  

mcdonald’s corporation annual report 2011 23 

similar assets taking into account anticipated technological or other changes the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors economic factors and industry trends if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or writeoffs in future periods 

 

 the company has a sharebased compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equitybased incentives including stock options and restricted stock units rsus to employees and nonemployee directors the expense for these equitybased incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period 

the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closedform pricing model the pricing model requires assumptions which impact the assumed fair value including the expected life of the stock option the riskfree interest rate expected volatility of the company’s stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield the company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants sharebased compensation expense will fluctuate in future years the fair value of each rsu granted is equal to the market price of the company’s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period 

 

 longlived assets including goodwill are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in assessing the recoverability of the company’s longlived assets the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the company’s experience and knowledge of its operations these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions operating costs inflation competition and consumer and demographic trends a key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales if the company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future the company may be required to record impairment charges based on the annual goodwill impairment test conducted in the fourth quarter the company does not have any reporting units defined as each individual country with goodwill currently at risk of impairment 

 

 in the ordinary course of business the company is subject to proceedings lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors customers employees franchisees government agencies intellectual property shareholders and suppliers the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses a determination of the amount of accrual required if any for these contingencies is made after 

careful analysis of each matter the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters the company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 

 

 the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies including the sale of appreciated assets in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if these estimates and assumptions change in the future the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance this could result in a charge to or an increase in income in the period such determination is made 

the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter in 2010 the internal revenue service irs concluded its field examination of the company’s us federal income tax returns for 2007 and 2008 in connection with this examination the company received notices of proposed adjustments from the irs related to certain foreign tax credits of about 400 million excluding interest and potential penalties the company disagrees with the irs’ proposed adjustments the company has filed a protest with the irs appeals office and expects resolution on this issue in 2012 the company does not believe that the resolution will have a material impact on its results of operations or cash flows the company’s 2009 and 2010 us federal income tax returns are currently under examination and the completion of the examination is expected in 2013 

deferred us income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling 126 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates the temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the us if management’s intentions change in the future deferred taxes may need to be provided 

effects of changing prices—inflation 

the company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively this ability is because of rapid inventory turnover the ability to adjust menu prices cost controls and substantial property holdings many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation 

reconciliation of returns on incremental invested capital

the denominator is the weightedaverage adjusted cash used for investing activities during the applicable oneor threeyear period adjusted cash used for investing activities is defined as cash used for investing activities less cash generated from investing activities related to the pret a manger and redbox transactions the weightedaverage adjusted cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis these weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter’s investing activities to incremental operating income for example fourth quarter 2011 investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income 125 of fourth quarter 2011 investing activities are included in the oneyear and threeyear calculations in contrast fourth quarter 2010 is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago and therefore have a full year impact on 2011 operating income with little or no impact to the base period 875 and 1000 of fourth quarter 2010 investing activities are included in the oneyear and threeyear calculations respectively management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average

 the company’s business is not dependent upon either a single customer or small group of customers 

 

 companyoperated restaurants have no backlog orders 

 

 no material portion of the business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the us government 

 

 mcdonald’s restaurants compete with international national regional and local retailers of food products the company competes on the basis of price convenience service menu variety and product quality in a highly fragmented global restaurant industry 

in measuring the company’s competitive position management reviews data compiled by euromonitor international a leading source of market data with respect to the global restaurant industry the company’s primary competition which management refers to as the informal eating out ieo segment includes the following restaurant categories defined by euromonitor international quickservice eating establishments casual dining fullservice restaurants 100 home deliverytakeaway providers street stalls or kiosks specialist coffee shops and selfservice cafeterias the ieo segment excludes establishments that primarily serve alcohol and fullservice restaurants other than casual dining 

based on data from euromonitor international the global ieo segment was composed of approximately 63 million outlets and generated 868 billion in annual sales in 2009 the most recent year for which data is available mcdonald’s systemwide 2009 restaurant business accounted for approximately 05 of those outlets and about 8 of the sales 

management also on occasion benchmarks mcdonald’s against the entire restaurant industry including the ieo segment defined above and all other fullservice restaurants based on data from euromonitor international the restaurant industry was composed of approximately 131 million outlets and generated about 179 trillion in annual sales in 2009 mcdonald’s systemwide restaurant business accounted for approximately 02 of those outlets and about 4 of the sales 

 

 the company operates research and development facilities in the us europe and asia while research and development activities are important to the company’s business these expenditures are not material independent suppliers also conduct research activities that benefit the company its franchisees and suppliers collectively referred to as the system 

 

 increased focus by us and overseas governmental authorities on environmental matters is likely to lead to new governmental initiatives particularly in the area of climate change while we cannot predict the precise nature of these initiatives we expect that they may impact our business both directly and indirectly although the impact would likely vary by world region andor market we believe that adoption of new regulations may increase costs including for the company its franchisees and suppliers also there is a possibility that governmental initiatives or actual or perceived effects of changes in weather patterns or climate could have a direct impact on the operations of our restaurants or the operations of our suppliers in ways which we cannot predict at this time 

the company monitors developments related to environmental matters and plans to respond to governmental initiatives in a timely and appropriate manner at this time the company has already undertaken its own initiatives relating to preservation of the environment including the development of means of monitoring and reducing energy use in many of its markets 

 

 the company’s number of employees worldwide including companyoperated restaurant employees was approximately 400000 as of yearend 2010

our business and execution of our strategic plan the plan to win are subject to risks the most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our customers and a brand they trust meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our operating environment the ieo segment of the restaurant industry although largely mature in our major markets is highly fragmented and competitive the current economic environment has caused the ieo segment to contract in many markets including some of our major markets and this may continue the current environment including persistently high unemployment rates in many of our markets has also increased consumer focus on value and heightened pricing pressures across the industry combined with increasing pressure on commodity and labor costs these circumstances could affect our ability to continue to grow comparable sales and margins despite the strength of our brand and value proposition we have the added challenge of the cultural economic and regulatory differences that exist among the more than 100 countries where we operate our operations plans and results are also affected by regulatory and similar initiatives around the world as well as by 

the focus on nutritional content and the production processing and preparation of food “from field to front counter” 

the risks we face can have an impact both in the near and longterm and are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe are most likely to affect our performance 

our ability to remain a relevant and trusted brand and to increase sales depends largely on how well we execute the plan to win 

the plan to win addresses the key drivers of our business and results—people products place price and promotion the quality of our execution depends mainly on the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  



  

  

  

  

  

  

 our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions which can adversely affect our sales margins and net income 

our results of operations are substantially affected not only by global economic conditions but also by local operating and economic conditions which can vary substantially by market unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market or daypart eg breakfast to mitigate the impact of these conditions we may take promotional or other actions that adversely affect our margins limit our operating flexibility or result in charges restaurant closings or sales of companyoperated restaurants some macroeconomic conditions could have an even more wideranging and prolonged impact the current environment has been characterized by weak economies persistently high unemployment rates and continuing uncertainty in financial and credit markets these conditions have significantly affected consumer confidence and spending moreover the strength of the current recovery is uncertain in many of our most important markets and growth in consumer spending generally lags improvement in the broader economy the key factors that can affect our operations plans and results in this environment are the following 

 

  



  

  

  

  

 increasing regulatory complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways 

our legal and regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance litigation and similar risks that affect our operations and results in material ways in many of our markets including the united states and europe we are subject to increasing regulation which has increased our cost of doing business in developing markets we face the risks associated with new and untested laws and judicial systems among the more important regulatory and litigation risks we face and must manage are the following 

 

  

  



  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  



the trading volatility and price of our common stock may be affected by many factors 

many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects the most important of these some of which are outside our control are the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our results can be adversely affected by disruptions or events such as the impact of severe weather conditions and natural disasters 

severe weather conditions natural disasters terrorist activities health epidemics or pandemics or expectations about them can have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels or on other factors that affect our results and prospects such as commodity costs our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to certain of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully

 strategic direction and financial performance 

the strength of the alignment among the company its franchisees and suppliers collectively referred to as the system has been key to mcdonald’s success this business model enables mcdonald’s to deliver consistent locallyrelevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve in addition it facilitates our ability to identify implement and scale innovative ideas that meet customers’ changing needs and preferences 

mcdonald’s customerfocused plan to win—which concentrates on being better not just bigger—provides a common framework for our global business yet allows for local adaptation through the execution of initiatives surrounding the five elements of our plan to win—people products place price and promotion—we have enhanced the restaurant experience for customers worldwide and grown comparable sales and customer visits in each of the last seven years this plan combined with financial discipline has delivered strong results for our shareholders 

we have exceeded our longterm constant currency financial targets of average annual systemwide sales growth of 3 to 5 average annual operating income growth of 6 to 7 and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens every year since the plan’s implementation in 2003 after adjusting for the loss in 2007 from the latin america developmental license transaction given the size and scope of our global business we believe these financial targets are realistic and sustainable over time keeping us focused on making the best decisions for the longterm benefit of our system 

in 2010 we continued to enhance the customer experience by remaining focused on the company’s key global success factors of branded affordability menu variety and beverage choice convenience including daypart expansion ongoing restaurant reinvestment and operations excellence initiatives around these factors successfully resonated with consumers driving increases in sales and customer visits despite challenging economies and a contracting informal eating out ieo market in many countries as a result every area of the world contributed to 2010 global comparable sales and guest counts which increased 50 and 49 respectively 

growth in comparable sales is driven by the system’s ability to optimize guest count growth product mix shifts and menu price changes pricing actions reflect local market conditions with a view to preserving and improving margins while continuing to drive guest counts and market share gains in general the goal is to achieve a balanced contribution of price and guest counts to comparable sales growth 

in the us we grew sales guest counts market share and restaurant cash flow with comparable sales increasing for the 8th consecutive year rising 38 in 2010 these positive results were achieved despite a declining ieo market 

this performance was attributed to several factors including core menu items like chicken mcnuggets and burgers everyday affordability and value options such as the breakfast dollar menu additions to the mccafé beverage line new snack offerings and limited time offerings such as the mcrib sandwich the national launch of mccafé frappés and realfruit smoothies provided a meaningful extension to the mccafé line that was wellreceived by customers extending the snack wrap line with the angus snack wraps allowed customers to enjoy popular mcdonald’s burgers in a smaller more portable fashion complementing these menu offerings were our convenient locations efficient drivethru service and valueoriented local beverage promotions we broadened our accessibility through greater 24 hour operations and offered customers free wifi in over 12000 restaurants modernizing the customer experience remained a focus with the extension of our interior and exterior reimaging program to enhance the appearance and functionality of our restaurants 

in europe comparable sales rose 44 marking the 7th consecutive year of comparable sales increases major contributors were france the uk russia and germany this performance reflected europe’s strategic priorities of upgrading the customer and employee experience increasing local relevance and building brand transparency initiatives surrounding these platforms included leveraging our tiered menu featuring everyday affordable prices menu variety including limitedtime offerings new dessert options and reimaging almost 1000 restaurants we expanded our coffee business and have nearly 1300 mccafé locations which in europe generally represent a separate area inside the restaurant that serves specialty coffees indulgent desserts and light snacks the expansion of selforder kiosks in france germany and spain and the roll out of the new drivethru customer order display system in over 3000 restaurants enhanced service in addition we increased our accessibility and convenience with extended hours we built upon the momentum of portable menu offerings with the introduction of mcwraps—larger sized beef and chicken wraps in germany and p’tit plaisir offerings in france finally we continued building customer trust in our brand through communications that emphasized the quality and origin of mcdonald’s food and our sustainable business initiatives 

in apmea our momentum continued with nearly every country delivering positive comparable sales led by japan australia and china comparable sales rose 60 through strategies emphasizing value core menu extensions breakfast and convenience australia launched family dinner boxes featuring popular menu items bundled together at a discounted price while china and japan concentrated on affordability with value lunch platforms new menu items such as a third angus burger option in australia and the extension of the spicy wings line in china were popular with consumers japan executed a successful usthemed burger promotion and a chicken festival promotion featuring several products our dessert strategy is introducing consumers to the mcdonald’s brand with products such as mcflurries and dessert kiosks in china where we have become one of the largest retailers of ice cream our breakfast business continues to develop and is now offered in approximately 75 of apmea restaurants in japan value breakfast items including the sausage mcmuffin and mcgriddle were rotated across several months while australia launched new breakfast menu items 

  

nearly twothirds of apmea restaurants are now offering some form of extended hours and over 4800 restaurants are open 24 hours delivery is offered in many apmea markets and is now in approximately 1600 restaurants including nearly 400 in china 

we continue to offer value to our customers by utilizing a strategic menu pricing tool that optimizes price product mix and promotions this approach is complemented by a focus on driving operating efficiencies and effectively managing restaurantlevel food and paper costs by leveraging our scale supply chain infrastructure and risk management practices our ability to execute our strategies successfully in every area of the world grow comparable sales leverage a low commodity cost environment and control selling general  administrative expenses resulted in consolidated combined operating margin operating income as a percent of total revenues of 310 in 2010 an improvement of 09 percentage points over 2009 

in 2010 strong global sales and margin performance grew cash from operations which rose 591 million to 63 billion our substantial cash flow strong credit rating and continued access to credit provide us significant flexibility to fund capital expenditures and debt repayments as well as return cash to shareholders capital expenditures of approximately 21 billion were invested in our business primarily to open and reimage restaurants across the system nearly 1000 restaurants were opened and nearly 1800 existing locations were reimaged we returned 51 billion to shareholders consisting of 24 billion in dividends and nearly 27 billion in share repurchases 

cash from operations continues to benefit from our heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income received from owneroperators provides a very stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs in addition the franchise business model is less capital intensive than the companyowned model we believe locallyowned and operated restaurants maximize brand performance and are at the core of our competitive advantage making mcdonald’s not just a global brand but also a locally relevant one

items food events and limitedtime offerings to present a balanced mix of products to our customers value will continue to be a key growth driver as we reinforce the affordability of our menu to consumers and build on our successful value lunch platforms we will invest in our business primarily by opening over 600 new restaurants and reimaging over 500 existing restaurants while elevating our focus on service and operations to drive efficiencies in china we will continue to build a foundation for longterm growth by increasing our base of restaurants by approximately 15 in 2011 toward our goal of nearly 2000 restaurants by the end of 2013 convenience initiatives include expanding delivery service across the region and building on the success of our extended operating hours 

mcdonald’s has an ongoing commitment to optimize our restaurant ownership structure a heavily franchised less capitalintensive business model has favorable implications for the strength and stability of our cash flow the amount of capital we invest and longterm returns 

we continue to maintain a strong culture of financial discipline by effectively managing all spending in order to maximize business performance in making capital allocation decisions our goal is to elevate the mcdonald’s experience by driving sustainable growth in sales and market share while earning strong returns we remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow cash from operations less capital expenditures to shareholders over the long term via dividends and share repurchases

impact of foreign currency translation on reported results 

while changing foreign currencies affect reported results mcdonald’s mitigates exposures where practical by financing in local currencies hedging certain foreigndenominated cash flows and purchasing goods and services in local currencies 

in 2010 foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results driven by stronger global curren 

cies primarily the australian dollar and canadian dollar partly offset by the weaker euro in 2009 foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results primarily driven by the euro british pound russian ruble australian dollar and canadian dollar in 2008 foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results driven by the stronger euro and most other currencies partly offset by the weaker british pound 

 

 

impact of foreign currency translation on reported results 

 

  

net income and diluted earnings per common share 

in 2010 net income and diluted earnings per common share were 49 billion and 458 results for the year included after tax charges due to impairment and other charges credits net of 25 million or 002 per share primarily related to the company’s share of restaurant closing costs in mcdonald’s japan a 50owned affiliate in conjunction with the first quarter strategic review of the market’s restaurant portfolio partly offset by 

income related to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 latin america developmental license transaction foreign currency translation had a positive impact of 001 per share on diluted earnings per share for the year 

in 2009 net income and diluted earnings per common share were 46 billion and 411 results benefited by after tax income due to impairment and other charges credits net of 91 million or 008 per share primarily due to the resolution of 

 

  

certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 latin america developmental license transaction results also benefited by an after tax gain of 59 million or 005 per share due to the sale of the company’s minority ownership interest in redbox reflected in gain on sale of investment results were negatively impacted by 015 per share due to the effect of foreign currency translation 

  

in 2008 net income and diluted earnings per common share were 43 billion and 376 results benefited by a 109 million or 009 per share after tax gain on the sale of the company’s minority ownership interest in pret a manger reflected in gain on sale of investment 

the company repurchased 378 million shares of its stock for nearly 27 billion in 2010 and 503 million shares of its stock for 29 billion in 2009 driving reductions of over 2 and 3 of total shares outstanding respectively net of stock option exercises 

 

 

 

revenues 

the company’s revenues consist of sales by companyoperated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments and initial fees revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales and generally include initial fees 

over the past three years the company has continued to optimize its restaurant ownership mix cash flow and returns through its refranchising strategy the shift to a greater percent 

age of franchised restaurants negatively impacted consolidated revenues as companyoperated sales shifted to franchised sales where the company receives rent andor royalties based on a percent of sales 

in 2010 constant currency revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales the impact of refranchising on consolidated revenues lessened because the number of companyoperated restaurants sold to franchisees has declined compared with 2009 and 2008 in line with our overall strategy in 2009 constant currency revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales and expansion partly offset by the impact of refranchising in certain of the company’s major markets 

revenues 

 

 

 

  

in the us revenues in 2010 and 2009 were positively impacted by the ongoing appeal of our iconic core products and the success of new products as well as continued focus on everyday value and convenience new products introduced in 2010 included mccafé frappés and smoothies as well as the angus snack wraps while new products introduced in 2009 included mccafé premium coffees and the angus third pounder refranchising activity negatively impacted revenue growth in both years 

europe’s constant currency increases in revenues in 2010 and 2009 were primarily driven by comparable sales increases in 

the uk france and russia which is entirely companyoperated as well as expansion in russia these increases were partly offset by the impact of refranchising activity primarily in the uk in 2010 and the uk and germany in 2009 

in apmea the constant currency increase in revenues in 2010 was primarily driven by comparable sales increases in china australia and most other markets the 2009 increase was primarily driven by comparable sales increases in australia and most other asian markets partly offset by negative comparable sales in china in addition expansion in china contributed to the increases in both years

franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the company but are the basis on which the company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the health of the franchisee base the following table presents franchised sales and the related increases 

franchised sales 

 

  

restaurant margins 

 

 franchised margin dollars represent revenues from franchised restaurants less the company’s occupancy costs rent and depreciation associated with those sites franchised margin dollars represented about twothirds of the combined restaurant margins in 2010 2009 and 2008 franchised margin dollars increased 479 million or 8 8 in constant currencies in 2010 and 254 million or 4 7 in constant currencies in 2009 positive comparable sales were the primary driver of the constant currency growth in franchise margin dollars in both years refranchising activity also contributed to the constant currency growth in franchise margin dollars in 2009 and to a lesser extent in 2010 

franchised margins 

 

   

in the us the franchised margin percent increase in 2010 was primarily due to positive comparable sales the 2009 decrease was due to additional depreciation primarily related to the company’s investment in the beverage initiative partly offset by positive comparable sales 

europe’s franchised margin percent decreased in 2010 and 2009 as positive comparable sales were more than offset by higher occupancy expenses the cost of strategic brand and sales building initiatives and the refranchising strategy 

in apmea the franchised margin percent decrease in 2010 was primarily driven by foreign currency translation mostly due to the stronger australian dollar 

the franchised margin percent in apmea and other countries  corporate is higher relative to the us and europe due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed andor affiliated restaurants where the company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs 

 

 companyoperated margin dollars represent sales by companyoperated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants companyoperated margin dollars increased 366 million or 13 12 in constant currencies in 2010 and decreased 101 million or 3 increased 3 in constant currencies in 2009 positive comparable sales and lower commodity costs were the primary drivers of the constant currency growth in companyoperated margin dollars and percent in 2010 positive comparable sales partly offset by higher commodity costs drove growth in constant currency companyoperated margin dollars and percent in 2009 in addition refranchising activity negatively impacted companyoperated margin dollars but benefited companyoperated margin percent in 2009 and to a lesser extent in 2010 

  

companyoperated margins 

 

 in the us the companyoperated margin percent increased in 2010 due to lower commodity costs and positive comparable sales partly offset by higher labor costs the margin percent increased in 2009 due to positive comparable sales partly offset by additional depreciation related to the beverage initiative and higher commodity costs refranchising had a positive impact on both periods 

europe’s companyoperated margin percent increased in 2010 primarily due to positive comparable sales and lower commodity costs partly offset by higher labor costs the margin percent increased in 2009 primarily due to positive comparable sales partly offset by higher commodity and labor costs in 2009 local inflation and the impact of weaker currencies on the cost of certain imported products drove higher costs primarily in russia and negatively impacted the companyoperated margin percent 

in apmea the companyoperated margin percent increased in 2010 primarily due to positive comparable sales and lower commodity costs partly offset by higher occupancy  other costs and increased labor costs the margin percent increased in 2009 due to positive comparable sales partly offset by higher labor costs 

 

 we continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance profits and returns in most cases franchising is the best way to achieve these goals but as previously stated companyoperated restaurants are also important to our success 

we report results for companyoperated restaurants based on their sales less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs we report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues less associated occupancy costs for this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of 

our ownership structure we do not specifically allocate selling general  administrative expenses and other operating income expenses to companyoperated or franchised restaurants other operating items that relate to the companyoperated restaurants generally include gainslosses on sales of restaurant businesses and writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements 

we believe the following information about companyoperated restaurants in our most significant markets provides an additional perspective on this business management responsible for our companyoperated restaurants in these markets analyzes the companyoperated business on this basis to assess its performance management of the company also considers this information when evaluating restaurant ownership mix subject to other relevant considerations 

the following table seeks to illustrate the two components of our companyoperated margins the first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations which we refer to as “store operating margin” the second relates to the value of our brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and royalties we refer to this component as “brandreal estate margin” both companyoperated and conventional franchised restaurants are charged rent and royalties although rent and royalties for companyoperated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation rent and royalties for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales and the actual rent percentage varies depending on the level of mcdonald’s investment in the restaurant royalty rates may also vary by market 

as shown in the following table in disaggregating the components of our companyoperated margins certain costs with respect to companyoperated restaurants are reflected in brandreal estate margin those costs consist of rent payable by mcdonald’s to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of occupancy  other operating expenses recorded in the consolidated statement of income store operating margins reflect rent and royalty expenses and those amounts are accounted for as income in calculating brandreal estate margin 

while we believe that the following information provides a perspective in evaluating our companyoperated business it is not intended as a measure of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating income or restaurant margins as reported by the company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us in particular as noted previously we do not allocate selling general  administrative expenses to our companyoperated business however we believe that a range of 40000 to 50000 per restaurant on average is a typical range of costs to support this business in the us the actual costs in markets outside the us will vary depending on local circumstances and the organizational structure of the market these costs reflect the indirect services we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant 

  

 

 

  

  

  

 

selling general  administrative expenses 

consolidated selling general  administrative expenses increased 4 4 in constant currencies in 2010 and decreased 5 2 in constant currencies in 2009 the vancouver winter olympics in february and the company’s biennial worldwide owneroperator convention in april contributed to the increase in 2010 the 2009 expenses decreased partly due to costs in 2008 related to the beijing summer olympics and the company’s biennial worldwide owneroperator convention 

selling general  administrative expenses 

 

  

 selling general  administrative expenses as a percent of revenues were 97 in 2010 compared with 98 in 2009 and 100 in 2008 selling general  administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales were 30 in 2010 compared with 31 in 2009 and 33 in 2008 management believes that analyzing selling general  administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales as well as revenues is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support systemwide restaurants 

  

impairment and other charges credits net 

the company recorded impairment and other charges credits net of 29 million in 2010 61 million in 2009 and 6 million in 2008 management does not include these items when reviewing business performance trends because we do not believe these items are indicative of expected ongoing results

 unconsolidated affiliates and partnerships are businesses in which the company actively participates but does not control the company records equity in earnings from these entities representing mcdonald’s share of results for foreign affiliated markets – primarily japan – results are reported after interest expense and income taxes mcdonald’s share of results for partnerships in certain consolidated markets such as the us is reported before income taxes these partnership restaurants are operated under conventional franchise arrangements and therefore are classified as conventional franchised restaurants results in 2010 reflected a reduction in the number of unconsolidated affiliate restaurants worldwide partly offset by improved operating performance in japan results in 2009 also reflected improved operating performance in japan and benefited from the stronger japanese yen

in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations the company uses interest rate exchange agreements and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated the company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties intercompany financings and longterm investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates this reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders’ equity total foreign currencydenominated debt was 47 billion and 45 billion for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively in addition where practical the company’s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges see summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives

other matters 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions 

the company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

 

 property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straightline basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets taking into account anticipated technological or other changes the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors economic factors and industry trends if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or writeoffs in future periods 

 

 the company has a sharebased compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equitybased incentives including stock options and restricted stock units rsus to employees and nonemployee directors the expense for these equitybased incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period 

the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closedform pricing model the pricing model requires assumptions which impact the assumed fair value including the expected life of the stock option the riskfree interest rate expected volatility of the company’s stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield the company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants sharebased compensation expense will fluctuate in future years the fair value of each rsu granted is equal to the market price of the company’s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period 

 

 longlived assets including goodwill are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in assessing the recoverability of the company’s longlived assets the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the company’s experience and knowledge of its operations these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions operating costs inflation competition and consumer and demographic trends a key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales if the company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future the company may be required to record impairment 

 

  

charges based on the annual goodwill impairment test conducted in the fourth quarter the company does not have any reporting units defined as each individual country with goodwill currently at risk of impairment 

 

 from time to time the company is subject to proceedings lawsuits and other claims related to competitors customers employees franchisees government agencies intellectual property shareholders and suppliers the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses a determination of the amount of accrual required if any for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters the company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 

 

 the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies including the sale of appreciated assets in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if these estimates and assumptions change in the future the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance this could result in a charge to or an increase in income in the period such determination is made 

in addition the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter in 2010 the internal revenue service irs concluded its field examination of the company’s us federal income tax returns for 2007 and 2008 as part of this exam the company resolved proposed adjustments related to transfer pricing matters that were previously received from the irs the tax provision impact associated with the completion of this field examination was not significant the company continues to disagree with the irs’ proposed adjustments related to certain foreign tax credits of about 400 million excluding interest and potential penalties the company continues to believe that these adjustments are not justified and intends to pursue all available remedies the company cannot predict with certainty the timing of resolution however the company does not believe the resolution will have a material impact on its results of operations or cash flows during 2008 the irs examination of the company’s 2005 and 2006 us federal income tax returns was completed the tax provision impact associated with the completion of this examination was not significant the irs 

examination of the company’s 2009 and 2010 us federal income tax returns is expected to begin in 2011 

deferred us income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling 110 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates the temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the us if management’s intentions change in the future deferred taxes may need to be provided 

effects of changing prices—inflation 

the company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively this ability is because of rapid inventory turnover the ability to adjust menu prices cost controls and substantial property holdings many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation 

reconciliation of returns on incremental invested capital 

return on incremental invested capital roiic is a measure reviewed by management over oneyear and threeyear time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital this measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation the numerator is the company’s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period 

the denominator is the weightedaverage adjusted cash used for investing activities during the applicable one or threeyear period adjusted cash used for investing activities is defined as cash used for investing activities less cash generated from investing activities related to the boston market latin america developmental license pret a manger and redbox transactions the weightedaverage adjusted cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis these weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter’s investing activities to incremental operating income for example fourth quarter 2010 investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income 125 of fourth quarter 2010 investing activities are included in the oneyear and threeyear calculations in contrast fourth quarter 2009 is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago and therefore have a full year impact on 2010 operating income with little or no impact to the base period 875 and 1000 of fourth quarter 2009 investing activities are included in the oneyear and threeyear calculations respectively management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average

 mcdonald’s restaurants compete with international national regional and local retailers of food products the company competes on the basis of price convenience service menu variety and product quality in a highly fragmented global restaurant industry 

in measuring the company’s competitive position management reviews data compiled by euromonitor international a leading source of market data with respect to the global restaurant industry the company’s primary competition which management refers to as the informal eating out ieo segment includes the following restaurant categories defined by euromonitor international quickservice eating establishments casual dining fullservice restaurants 100 home deliverytakeaway providers street stalls or kiosks specialist coffee shops and selfservice cafeterias the ieo segment excludes establishments that primarily serve alcohol and fullservice restaurants other than casual dining 

based on data from euromonitor international the global ieo segment was composed of approximately 59 million outlets and generated 875 billion in annual sales in 2008 the most recent year for which data is available mcdonald’s global 2008 restaurant business accounted for approximately 05 of those outlets and about 8 of the sales 

management also on occasion benchmarks mcdonald’s against the entire restaurant industry including the ieo segment defined above and all other fullservice restaurants based on data from euromonitor international the restaurant industry was composed of approximately 126 million outlets and generated about 185 trillion in annual sales in 2008 mcdonald’s global restaurant business accounted for approximately 02 of those outlets and about 4 of the sales

 increased focus by us and overseas governmental authorities on environmental matters is likely to lead to new governmental initiatives particularly in the area of climate change while we cannot predict the precise nature of these initiatives we expect that they may impact our business both directly and indirectly although the impact would likely vary by world region andor market we believe that adoption of new regulations may increase costs including for the company its franchisees and suppliers also there is a possibility that governmental initiatives or actual or perceived effects of changes in weather patterns or climate could have a direct impact on the operations of our restaurants or the operations of our suppliers in ways which we cannot predict at this time 

the company continually monitors developments related to environmental matters and plans to respond to governmental initiatives in a timely and appropriate manner at this time the company has already undertaken its own initiatives relating to preservation of the environment including the development of means of monitoring and reducing energy use in many of its markets

 item 1a risk factors and cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements 

 

 

this report includes forwardlooking statements about our plans and future performance including those under outlook for 2010 these statements use such words as “may” “will” “expect” “believe” and “plan” they reflect our expectations and speak only as of the date of this report we do not undertake to update them our expectations or the underlying assumptions may change or not be realized and you should not rely unduly on forwardlooking statements 

our business and execution of our strategic plan the plan to win are subject to risks the most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our customers and a brand they trust meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our operating environment the informal eating out ieo segment of the restaurant industry although largely mature in our major markets is highly fragmented and competitive the current economic environment has caused the ieo segment to contract in many markets including some of our major markets and this may continue the current economic environment has increased consumer focus on value heightening pricing pressures across the industry which could affect our ability to continue to grow sales despite the strength of our brand and value proposition we have the added challenge of the cultural economic and regulatory differences that exist among the more than 100 countries where we operate regulatory and similar initiatives around the world have also become more wideranging and prescriptive and affect how we operate and our results in 

particular increasing focus on nutritional content and on the production processing and preparation of food “from field to front counter” presents challenges for our brand 

the risks we face can have an impact both in the near and longterm and are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe are most likely to affect our performance 

our ability to remain a relevant and trusted brand and to increase sales depends largely on how well we execute the plan to win particularly as the global economy emerges from recession 

the plan to win addresses the key drivers of our business and results—people products place price and promotion the quality of our execution depends mainly on the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions which can adversely affect our sales margins and net income 

our results of operations are substantially affected not only by global economic conditions but also by local operating and economic conditions which can vary substantially by market unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market or daypart eg breakfast to mitigate the impact of these conditions we may take promotional or other actions that adversely affect our margins limit our operating flexibility or result in charges restaurant closings or sales of companyoperated restaurants some macroeconomic conditions could have an even more wideranging and prolonged impact the current environment has been characterized by slowing economies rising unemployment declining wages constrained credit and volatile financial markets these conditions have significantly affected consumer spending and habits moreover the timing and strength of a recovery is uncertain in many of our most important markets and growth in consumer spending generally lags improvement in the broader economy the key factors that affect our ability to manage the impact of these conditions are the following 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

 increasing regulatory complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways 

our legal and regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance litigation and similar risks that affect our operations and results in material ways in many of our markets including the united states and europe we are subject to increasing regulation which has increased our cost of doing business in developing markets we face the risks associated with new and untested laws and judicial systems among the more important regulatory and litigation risks we face and must manage are the following 

 

  

  

  

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the trading volatility and price of our common stock may be affected by many factors 

many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects the most important of these some of which are outside our control are the following 

 

  

 

  

  

  

 our results and financial condition are affected by our ownership mix 

our refranchising strategy involves a shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants the decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex and changing when we refranchise a restaurant it reduces consolidated revenues as companyoperated sales shift to franchised sales where we receive rent andor royalties it also reduces companyoperated margin dollars while increasing franchised margin dollars with the impact on margin percentages varying based on sales and operating costs of the refranchised restaurants our refranchising strategy can also expose us to risks including the following 

 

  

  

 

  

our results can be adversely affected by disruptions or events such as the impact of severe weather conditions and natural disasters 

severe weather conditions natural disasters terrorist activities health epidemics or pandemics or the prospect of these events can have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels or on other factors that affect our results and prospects such as commodity costs our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to certain of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

 

overview 

description of the business 

the company franchises and operates mcdonald’s restaurants of the 32478 restaurants in 117 countries at yearend 2009 26216 were operated by franchisees including 19020 operated by conventional franchisees 3160 operated by developmental licensees and 4036 operated by foreign affiliated markets affiliates—primarily in japan and 6262 were operated by the company under our conventional franchise arrangement franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment signs seating and décor of their restaurant businesses and by reinvesting in the business over time the company owns the land and building or secures longterm leases for both companyoperated and conventional franchised restaurant sites this maintains longterm occupancy rights helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees in certain circumstances the company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants under our developmental license arrangement licensees provide capital for the entire business including the real estate interest and the company has no capital invested in addition the company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market 

we view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and believe franchising is important to delivering great locallyrelevant customer experiences and driving profitability however directly operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and is essential to providing company personnel with restaurant operations experience in our companyoperated restaurants and in collaboration with franchisees we further develop and refine operating standards marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced systemwide we continually review our mix of companyoperated and franchised conventional franchised developmental licensed and affiliated restaurants to help maximize overall performance 

the company’s revenues consist of sales by companyoperated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments and initial fees revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales and may include initial fees fees vary by type of site amount of company investment if any and local business conditions these fees along with occupancy and operating rights are stipulated in franchiselicense agreements that generally have 20year terms 

the business is managed as distinct geographic segments significant reportable segments include the united states us europe and asiapacific middle east and africa apmea in addition throughout this report we present “other countries  corporate” that includes operations in canada and latin america as well as corporate activities the us europe and apmea segments account for 35 41 and 19 of total revenues respectively france germany and the united kingdom uk 

collectively account for approximately 55 of europe’s revenues and australia china and japan a 50owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method collectively account for over 50 of apmea’s revenues these six markets along with the us and canada are referred to as “major markets” throughout this report and comprise over 70 of total revenues 

the company continues to focus its management and financial resources on the mcdonald’s restaurant business as we believe opportunities remain for longterm growth accordingly in 2009 the company sold its minority ownership interest in redbox automated retail llc redbox for total consideration of 140 million in 2008 the company sold its minority ownership interest in ukbased pret a manger for cash proceeds of 229 million in connection with both sales the company recognized nonoperating gains during 2007 the company sold its investment in boston market as a result of the disposal boston market’s results of operations and transaction gain are reflected as discontinued operations as of december 31 2009 the company had disposed of all nonmcdonald’s restaurant businesses 

in analyzing business trends management considers a variety of performance and financial measures including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth systemwide sales growth restaurant margins and returns 

 

  

  

 

  

  

 strategic direction and financial performance 

the strength of the alignment between the company its franchisees and suppliers collectively referred to as the system has been key to mcdonald’s success over the years this business model enables mcdonald’s to consistently deliver locallyrelevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve in addition it facilitates our ability to identify implement and scale innovative ideas that meet customers’ changing needs and preferences 

mcdonald’s customerfocused plan to win—which is centered around being better not just bigger—provides a common framework for our global business yet allows for local adaptation through the execution of multiple initiatives surrounding the five key drivers of exceptional customer experiences—people products place price and promotion—we have enhanced the restaurant experience for customers worldwide and grown sales and customer visits in each of the last six years this plan coupled with financial discipline has delivered strong results for shareholders 

we have exceeded our longterm constant currency financial targets of average annual systemwide sales growth of 3 to 5 average annual operating income growth of 6 to 7 and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens every year since the plan’s implementation in 2003 after adjusting 2007 for the latin america developmental license transaction given the size and scope of our global business we believe these financial targets are realistic and sustainable while keeping us focused on making the best decisions for the longterm benefit of shareholders 

in 2009 we continued to elevate the customer experience by remaining focused on the company’s key global success factors of branded affordability menu variety and beverage choice convenience and daypart expansion ongoing restaurant reinvestment and operations excellence locallyrelevant initiatives around these factors successfully resonated with consumers driving increases in sales customer visits and market share in many countries despite challenging global economies and a contracting informal eating out market as a result each reportable segment contributed to 2009 global comparable sales and guest counts which increased 38 and 14 respectively 

in the us we grew sales and market share with comparable sales up for the 7th consecutive year rising 26 in 2009 this performance was the result of a continued focus on classic menu favorites such as the big mac and quarter pounder increased emphasis on everyday affordability and the national marketing launch of the new mccafé premium coffees and premium angus third pounder complementing these efforts were our strategies 

related to convenient locations extended hours efficient drivethru service and valueoriented local beverage promotions in conjunction with the introduction of the mccafé premium coffees reinvestment was needed in many restaurants to accommodate the new equipment required to prepare these beverages as well as facilitate the national introduction of smoothies and frappés in mid2010 in most cases this reinvestment involved expanding and optimizing the efficiency of the drivethru booth enabling us to better serve even more customers faster 

in europe comparable sales rose 52 marking the 6th consecutive year of comparable sales increases this performance reflected europe’s strategic priorities to upgrade the customer and employee experience enhance local relevance and build brand transparency initiatives surrounding these priorities encompassed leveraging our tiered menu featuring locally relevant selections of premium classic core and everyday affordable menu offerings as well as dessert and limitedtime food promotions and reimaging nearly 900 restaurants including adding about 290 mccafés—an upscale area with coffeehousestyle ambiance inside an existing mcdonald’s restaurant in addition we addressed growing interest in portable snack offerings with platforms such as the little tasters in the uk launched breakfast in germany and increased our convenience with extended hours in order to support greater menu variety we completed the rollout of a new more efficient kitchen operating system in substantially all of our european restaurants finally we enhanced customer trust in our brand through communications that emphasized the quality and origin of mcdonald’s food and our sustainable business practices 

in apmea we continued to execute our four growth platforms of breakfast convenience core menu and value comparable sales rose 34 primarily due to the ongoing momentum of our business in australia where multiple initiatives surrounding menu variety including the launch of the premium angus burger greater convenience and reimaging further strengthened our brand relevance in addition across the segment we enhanced our convenience by increasing the number of restaurants open 24hours to over 4600 expanding delivery service to more than 1300 locations including about 300 in china and enhancing drivethru efficiency we sustained the momentum of our breakfast business currently in about 75 of our restaurants by increasing customer awareness and visit frequency with the launch of premium roast coffee in key markets like japan and china and promoting it through successful sampling programs we continued to appeal to customers with branded affordability menus especially our value lunch platforms and highlighted classic menu favorites like the quarter pounder 

our customercentered strategies seek to optimize price product mix and promotion as a means to drive sales and profits this approach is complemented by a focus on driving operating efficiencies and effectively managing restaurantlevel costs by leveraging our scale supply chain infrastructure and risk management practices our ability to successfully execute our strategies in every area of the world contributed to improved profitability as measured by combined operating margin of 301 in 2009 an improvement of 27 percentage points over 2008 

strong global performance positively impacted cash from operations which totaled 58 billion in 2009 our substantial cash flow strong credit rating and continued access to credit provide us significant flexibility to fund capital expenditures as well as return cash to shareholders about 20 billion of cash 

  

from operations was invested in our business primarily to open 868 restaurants 511 net after 357 closings and reimage about 1850 existing locations after these capital expenditures we returned our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in 2009 we returned 51 billion consisting of 22 billion in dividends and 29 billion in share repurchases this brought the total return to shareholders to 166 billion under our 15 billion to 17 billion target for 2007 through 2009 

cash from operations continues to benefit from our evolution toward a more heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income received from owneroperators is a very stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs and is less capitalintensive in addition we believe locallyowned and operated restaurants help us maximize brand performance and are at the core of our competitive advantage making mcdonald’s not just a global brand but also a locallyrelevant one to that end for 2008 and 2009 combined we refranchised about 1100 restaurants increasing the percent of restaurants franchised worldwide to 81 refranchising impacts our consolidated financial statements as follows

 outlook for 2010 

we will continue to drive success in 2010 and beyond by remaining focused on our “better not just bigger” strategy and the key drivers of exceptional customer experiences—people products place price and promotion our global system is energized by our ongoing momentum strong competitive position and growth opportunities 

we intend to further differentiate our brand increase customer visits and grow market share by pursuing initiatives in three key areas service enhancement restaurant reimaging and menu innovation these efforts will include leveraging technology to make it easier for restaurant staff to quickly and accurately serve customers accelerating our interior and exterior reimaging efforts and innovating at every tier of our menu to deliver great taste and value to customers as we execute along these priorities and remain disciplined in operations and financial management we expect to increase mcdonald’s brand relevance widen our competitive lead and in turn grow sales profits and returns as we do so we are confident we can meet or exceed the longterm constant currency financial targets previously discussed despite expectations for a continued challenging global economic environment in 2010 

in the us our strategies include strengthening our core menu and value offerings aggressively pursuing new growth opportunities in chicken breakfast beverages and snacking options and elevating the brand experience our initiatives include highlighting the enduring appeal of core menu classics such as the big mac emphasizing the value our menu offers alldaylong including the new breakfast value menu and encouraging the trial of new products with the mac snack wrap and—by midyear—frappés and smoothies in addition our plans to elevate the brand experience encompass updating our technology with a new point of sale system enhancing restaurant manager and crew retention and productivity and initiating a multiyear program to contemporize the interiors and exteriors of our restaurants through reimaging completing about 500 in 2010 these efforts combined with the convenience of our locations optimized drivethru service free wireless service and longer operating hours will further reinforce mcdonald’s position as an easy enjoyable eatingout experience 

our plans for europe are focused on building market share as we continue to execute along europe’s three key priorities this includes upgrading our restaurant ambiance by reimaging approximately 1000 restaurants primarily in france and the uk as we make progress toward our goal to reimage more than 85 of our restaurants by the end of 2011 in addition we expect to leverage technologies such as selforder kiosks handheld order devices and drivethru customer order displays to enhance the customer experience and help speed service we will further enhance our local relevance by complementing our tieredmenu with limitedtime food events as well as new snack and dessert options finally we will remain approachable and accessible as we continue to educate consumers about the quality and origin of our food and communicate our sustainable business practices 

in apmea we will execute initiatives that best support our goal to be customers’ first choice for eating out convenience core menu branded affordability improved operations and reimaging our convenience initiatives include leveraging the success of 24hour or extended operating hours expanding delivery service and building drivethru traffic at the same time we will continue to elevate the role of our classic core and breakfast menus complementing both with locallyrelevant food news we will maximize the impact of our everyday affordability platforms with midtier and value lunch programs and intensify our focus on operations to drive efficiencies in addition we will accelerate our reimaging efforts using a set of standard interior and exterior designs finally given its size and longterm 

  

potential we will continue to aggressively open new restaurants in china with a goal of opening about 600 restaurants over the next three years 

we will continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize our mix of companyoperated and franchised restaurants and expect to refranchise restaurants when and where appropriate as previously discussed our evolution toward a more heavily franchised less capitalintensive business model has favorable implications for the strength and stability of our cash flow the amount of capital we invest and longterm returns as a result we expect free cash flow—cash from operations less capital expenditures—will continue to grow in the future we remain committed to returning all this cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases over the long term 

we will remain disciplined financially as we seek to maximize the impact of all of our spending from selling general  administrative expenses to capital expenditures in making capital allocation decisions our goal is to elevate the mcdonald’s experience to drive sustainable growth in sales and market share while earning strong returns to that end about half of the 24 billion of planned 2010 capital expenditures will be invested to reimage existing restaurants with the other half primarily used to build new locations

in august 2007 the company completed the sale of its businesses in brazil argentina mexico puerto rico venezuela and 13 other countries in latin america and the caribbean which totaled 1571 restaurants to a developmental licensee organization the company refers to these markets as “latam” as a result of the latam transaction the company receives royalties in these markets instead of a combination of companyoperated sales and franchised rents and royalties 

based on approval by the company’s board of directors on april 17 2007 the company concluded latam was “held for sale” as of that date in accordance with guidance on the impairment or disposal of longlived assets as a result the company recorded an impairment charge of 17 billion in 2007 substantially all of which was noncash the charge included 896 million for the difference between the net book value of the latam business and approximately 675 million in cash proceeds received this loss in value was primarily due to a historically difficult economic environment coupled with volatility experienced in many of the markets included in this transaction the charges also included historical foreign currency translation losses of 769 million recorded in shareholders’ equity 

the company recorded a tax benefit of 62 million in 2007 in connection with this transaction as a result of meeting the 

“held for sale” criteria the company ceased recording depreciation expense with respect to latam effective april 17 2007 in connection with the sale the company agreed to indemnify the buyers for certain tax and other claims certain of which are reflected as liabilities on mcdonald’s consolidated balance sheet totaling 97 million at december 31 2009 and 142 million at december 31 2008 the change in the balance was primarily a result of the resolution of certain of these liabilities as well as the impact of foreign currency translation the company mitigates the currency impact to income of these foreign currency denominated liabilities through the use of forward foreign exchange agreements 

the buyers of the company’s operations in latam entered into a 20year master franchise agreement that requires the buyers among other obligations to i pay monthly royalties commencing at a rate of approximately 5 of gross sales of the restaurants in these markets substantially consistent with market rates for similar license arrangements ii commit to adding approximately 150 new mcdonald’s restaurants by the end of 2010 and pay an initial fee for each new restaurant opened and iii commit to specified annual capital expenditures for existing restaurants 

  

in addition to the consolidated operating results shown on the previous page consolidated results for 2007 and adjusted growth rates for 2008 are presented in the following table excluding the impact of the latam transaction these results include the effect of foreign currency translation further discussed in the section titled impact of foreign currency translation on reported results while the company has converted certain 

other markets to a developmental license arrangement management believes the latam transaction and the associated charge are not indicative of ongoing operations due to the size and scope of the transaction management believes that the adjusted operating results better reflect the underlying business trends relevant to the periods presented

revenues 

the company’s revenues consist of sales by companyoperated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments and initial fees revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales and generally include initial fees 

the company continues to optimize its restaurant ownership mix cash flow and returns through its refranchising strategy for the full years 2008 and 2009 combined the company refranchised about 1100 restaurants primarily in its major markets the shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants negatively impacts consolidated revenues as companyoperated sales shift to franchised sales where the company receives rent andor royalties based on a percent of sales 

in 2009 constant currency revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales and expansion partly offset by the impact of the refranchising strategy in certain of the company’s major markets as a result of the refranchising strategy franchised restaurants represent 81 80 and 78 of systemwide restaurants at december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

in 2008 constant currency revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales partly offset by the refranchising strategy and the impact of the latam transaction upon completion of the latam transaction in august 2007 the company receives royalties based on a percent of sales in these markets instead of a combination of companyoperated sales and franchised rents and royalties 

 

revenues 

 

 

   

in the us revenues in 2009 and 2008 were positively impacted by the ongoing appeal of our iconic core products and the success of new products as well as continued focus on everyday value and convenience in addition our marketleading breakfast business contributed to revenue growth in 2008 new products introduced in 2009 included mccafé premium coffees and the angus third pounder while new products introduced in 2008 included southern style chicken products iced coffee and sweet tea the refranchising strategy negatively impacted revenue growth in both years 

europe’s constant currency increases in revenues in 2009 and 2008 were primarily driven by comparable sales increases in the uk france and russia which is entirely companyoperated as well as expansion in russia in both years these increases were partly offset by the impact of the refranchising strategy primarily in the uk and germany 

in apmea the constant currency increase in revenues in 2009 was primarily driven by comparable sales increases in australia and most other asian markets partly offset by negative comparable sales in china the 2008 increase was primarily driven by strong comparable sales in australia and china as well as positive comparable sales throughout the segment in addition expansion in china contributed to the increases in both years 

in other countries  corporate companyoperated sales declined in 2008 while franchised revenues increased primarily as a result of the latam transaction in august 2007 revenues in both years were negatively impacted by the refranchising strategy in canada

 restaurant margins 

 

 franchised margin dollars represent revenues from franchised restaurants less the company’s occupancy costs rent and depreciation associated with those sites franchised margin dollars represented nearly 70 of the combined restaurant margins in 2009 and about 65 of the combined restaurant margins in 2008 and 2007 franchised margin dollars increased 254 million or 4 7 in constant currencies in 2009 and 

695 million or 14 11 in constant currencies in 2008 the refranchising strategy contributed to the growth in franchised margin dollars in both 2009 and 2008 and the august 2007 latam transaction contributed to the growth in 2008 

franchised margins 

 

 in the us the franchised margin percent decrease in 2009 was due to additional depreciation primarily related to the company’s investment in the beverage initiative partly offset by positive comparable sales the 2008 increase was primarily driven by positive comparable sales partly offset by the refranchising strategy 

europe’s franchised margin percent decreased in 2009 as positive comparable sales were offset by higher occupancy expenses the refranchising strategy and the cost of strategic brand and sales building initiatives the 2008 increase was primarily due to strong comparable sales in most markets partly offset by the impact of the refranchising strategy higher rent expense and the cost of strategic brand and sales building initiatives 

in apmea the franchised margin percent increase in 2008 was primarily driven by positive comparable sales 

in other countries  corporate the franchised margin percent increased in 2008 as a result of the 2007 latam transaction 

the franchised margin percent in apmea and beginning in 2008 other countries  corporate is higher relative to the us and europe due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed andor affiliated restaurants where the company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs 

 

 companyoperated margin dollars represent sales by companyoperated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants companyoperated margin dollars decreased 101 million or 3 increased 3 in constant currencies in 2009 and increased 39 million or 1 decreased 1 in constant currencies in 2008 after the latam transaction in august 2007 there are no companyoperated restaurants remaining in latin america companyoperated margin dollars were negatively impacted by this transaction in 2008 and 2007 and by the refranchising strategy in 2009 and 2008 the refranchising strategy had a positive impact on the margin percent in 2009 and 2008 primarily in the us and europe 

  

companyoperated margins 

 

 

 in the us the companyoperated margin percent increased in 2009 due to positive comparable sales and the impact of the refranchising strategy partly offset by additional depreciation related to the beverage initiative and higher commodity costs the margin percent decreased in 2008 due to cost pressures including higher commodity and labor costs partly offset by positive comparable sales 

europe’s companyoperated margin percent increased in 2009 and 2008 primarily due to positive comparable sales partly offset by higher commodity and labor costs in 2009 local inflation and the impact of weaker currencies on the cost of certain imported products drove higher costs primarily in russia and negatively impacted the companyoperated margin percent 

in apmea the companyoperated margin percent in 2009 and 2008 increased due to positive comparable sales partly offset by higher labor costs the margin percent in 2008 was also negatively impacted by higher commodity costs 

in other countries  corporate the companyoperated margin in 2007 benefited by about 100 basis points related to the discontinuation of depreciation on the assets in latam from midapril through july 2007 

 

 we continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance profits and returns in most cases franchising is the best way to achieve these goals but as previously stated companyoperated restaurants are also important to our success 

we report results for companyoperated restaurants based on their sales less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs we report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues less associated occupancy costs for this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure we do not specifically allocate selling general  administrative expenses and other operating income expenses to companyoperated or franchised restaurants other operating items that relate to the companyoperated restaurants generally include gainslosses on sales of restaurant businesses and writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements 

we believe the following information about companyoperated restaurants in our most significant markets provides an additional perspective on this business management responsible for our companyoperated restaurants in these markets analyzes the companyoperated business on this basis to assess its performance management of the company also considers this information when evaluating restaurant ownership mix subject to other relevant considerations 

the following tables seek to illustrate the two components of our companyoperated margins the first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations which we refer to as “store operating margin” the second relates to the value of our brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and royalties we refer to this component as “brandreal estate margin” both companyoperated and conventional franchised restaurants are charged rent and royalties although rent and royalties for companyoperated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation rent and royalties for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales and the actual rent percentage varies depending on the level of mcdonald’s investment in the restaurant royalty rates may also vary by market 

as shown in the following tables in disaggregating the components of our companyoperated margins certain costs with respect to companyoperated restaurants are reflected in brandreal estate margin those costs consist of rent payable by mcdonald’s to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of occupancy  other operating expenses recorded in the consolidated statement of income store operating margins reflect rent and royalty expenses and those amounts are accounted for as income in calculating brandreal estate margin 

  

while we believe that the following information provides a perspective in evaluating our companyoperated business it is not intended as a measure of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating income or restaurant margins as reported by the company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us in particular as noted previously we do not allocate selling general  administrative expenses to our companyoperated business however we believe that a range of 40000 to 50000 per restaurant on average is a typical range of costs to support this business in the us the actual costs in markets outside the us will vary depending on local circumstances and the organizational structure of the market these costs reflect the indirect services we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant

the company uses major capital markets bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense the company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring redeeming and repurchasing debt terminating exchange agreements and using derivatives the company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes all exchange agreements are overthecounter instruments 

in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations the company uses interest rate exchange agreements and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated the company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties intercompany financings and longterm investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates this reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders’ equity total foreign currencydenominated debt was 45 billion for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 in addition where practical the company’s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges see summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial

foreign currency net asset exposures 

 

 

 the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the company’s results of operations cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments the interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10 in the same direction relative to the us dollar on all financial instruments however the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the us based on the results of these analyses of the company’s financial instruments neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2009 levels nor a 10 adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2009 levels would materially affect the company’s results of operations cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments

other matters 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions 

the company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

 

 property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straightline basis over their useful lives based on management’s 

estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets taking into account anticipated technological or other changes the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors economic factors and industry trends if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or writeoffs in future periods 

 

 the company has a sharebased compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equitybased incentives including stock options and restricted stock units rsus to employees and nonemployee directors the expense for these equitybased incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period 

the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closedform pricing model the pricing model requires assumptions such as the expected life of the stock option the riskfree interest rate and expected volatility of the company’s stock over the expected life which significantly impact the assumed fair value the company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants sharebased compensation expense will fluctuate in future years the fair value of each rsu granted is equal to the market price of the company’s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period 

 

 longlived assets including goodwill are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in assessing the recoverability of the company’s longlived assets the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the company’s experience and knowledge of its operations these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions operating costs inflation competition and consumer and demographic trends a key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales if the company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future the company may be required to record impairment charges based on the annual goodwill impairment test conducted in the fourth quarter the company does not have any reporting units defined as each individual country with goodwill currently at risk of impairment 

when the company sells an existing business to a developmental licensee it determines when these businesses are “held for sale” in accordance with guidance on the impairment or disposal of longlived assets impairment charges on assets held for sale are recognized when management and if required the company’s board of directors have approved and committed to a 

  

plan to dispose of the assets the assets are available for disposal the disposal is probable of occurring within 12 months and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than the assets’ net book value among other factors an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the net book value of the business including foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity and the estimated cash sales price less costs of disposal 

an alternative accounting policy would be to recharacterize some or all of any loss as an intangible asset and amortize it to expense over future periods based on the term of the relevant licensing arrangement and as revenue is recognized for royalties and initial fees under this alternative for the 2007 latam transaction approximately 900 million of the 17 billion impairment charge could have been recharacterized as an intangible asset and amortized over the franchise term of 20 years resulting in about 45 million of expense annually this policy would be based on a view that the consideration for the sale consists of two components–the cash sales price and the future royalties and initial fees 

the company bases its accounting policy on management’s determination that royalties payable under its developmental license arrangements are substantially consistent with market rates for similar license arrangements the company does not believe it would be appropriate to recognize an asset for the right to receive marketbased fees in future periods particularly given the continuing support and services provided to the licensees therefore the company believes that the recognition of an impairment charge based on the net cash sales price reflects the substance of the sale transaction 

 

 from time to time the company is subject to proceedings lawsuits and other claims related to competitors customers employees franchisees government agencies intellectual property shareholders and suppliers the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses a determination of the amount of accrual required if any for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters the company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 

 

 the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies including the sale of appreciated assets in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if these estimates and assumptions change in the future the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance this could result in a charge to or an increase in income in the period such determination is made 

in addition the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions the 

company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter during 2008 the irs examination of the company’s 20052006 us tax returns was completed the tax provision impact associated with the completion of this examination was not significant during 2007 the company recorded a 316 million benefit as a result of the completion of an irs examination of the company’s 20032004 us tax returns the company’s 20072008 us tax returns are currently under examination and the completion of the examination is expected in 2010 

deferred us income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling 92 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates the temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the us if management’s intentions change in the future deferred taxes may need to be provided 

effects of changing prices—inflation 

the company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively this is because of rapid inventory turnover the ability to adjust menu prices cost controls and substantial property holdings many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation 

reconciliation of returns on incremental invested capital 

return on incremental invested capital roiic is a measure reviewed by management over oneyear and threeyear time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital this measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation the numerator is the company’s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period 

the denominator is the weightedaverage adjusted cash used for investing activities during the applicable one or threeyear period adjusted cash used for investing activities is defined as cash used for investing activities less cash generated from investing activities related to the boston market chipotle latam pret a manger and redbox transactions the weightedaverage adjusted cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis these weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter’s investing activities to incremental operating income for example fourth quarter 2009 investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income 125 of fourth quarter 2009 investing activities are included in the oneyear and threeyear calculations in contrast fourth quarter 2008 is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago and therefore have a full year impact on 2009 operating income with little or no impact to the base period 875 and 1000 of fourth quarter 2008 investing activities are included in the oneyear and threeyear calculations respectively management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average

 item 1a   risk factors and cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements tableend  

 

this report includes forwardlooking statements about our plans and future performance including those under outlook for 2009 these statements use such words as “may” “will” “expect” 

  

“believe” and “plan” they reflect our expectations and speak only as of the date of this report we do not undertake to update them our expectations or the underlying assumptions may change or not be realized and you should not rely unduly on forwardlooking statements 

our business and execution of our strategic plan the plan to win are subject to risks the most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our customers and a brand they trust meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our operating environment the informal eating out segment of the restaurant industry although largely mature in our major markets is also highly fragmented and competitive we have the added challenge of the cultural economic and regulatory differences that exist among the more than 100 countries where we operate we also face risk in adapting our business model in particular markets the decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex and changing regulatory and similar initiatives around the world have also become more wideranging and prescriptive and affect how we operate and our results in particular increasing focus on nutritional content and on the production processing and preparation of food “from field to front counter” presents challenges for our brand 

these risks can have an impact both in the near and longterm and are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe are most likely to affect our performance 

our ability to remain a relevant and trusted brand and to increase sales depends largely on how well we execute the plan to win 

the plan to win addresses the key drivers of our business and results—people products place price and promotion the quality of our execution depends mainly on the following 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions which can adversely affect our sales margins and net income 

our results of operations are substantially affected not only by global economic conditions but also by local operating and economic conditions which can vary substantially by market unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market and may prompt promotional or other actions that adversely affect our margins constrain our operating flexibility or result in charges restaurant closings or sales of companyoperated restaurants certain macroeconomic events such as the current uncertain economic conditions could have an even more wideranging and prolonged impact on the general business environment which could also adversely affect us whether we can manage these risks effectively depends mainly on the following 

 



  

  

  

  

  

 our results and financial condition are affected by our ownership mix and whether we can achieve a mix that optimizes margins and returns while meeting our business needs and customer expectations 

in recent years we have reduced the number of companyoperated restaurants and we are planning further reductions by refranchising companyoperated restaurants or entering into developmental license agreements whether and when we can achieve these plans as well as their success is uncertain and will be affected by the following 

 

  

  

  

   

increasing regulatory complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways 

our legal and regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance litigation and similar risks that affect our operations and results in material ways in many of our markets including the united states and europe we are subject to increasing regulation which has increased our cost of doing business in developing markets we face the risks associated with new and untested laws and judicial systems among the more important regulatory and litigation risks we face and must manage are the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  



  

  

 the trading volatility and price of our common stock may be affected by many factors 

many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects the most important of these some of which are outside our control are the following 

 

  

  

  

 our results can be adversely affected by disruptions or events such as the impact of severe weather conditions and natural disasters 

severe weather conditions terrorist activities health epidemics or pandemics or the prospect of these events can have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels or on other factors that affect our results and prospects such as commodity costs our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to certain of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully

the company believes that it has substantial legal and factual defenses to the plaintiffs’ claims and intends to defend its interests vigorously 

 

 a substantial number of mcdonald’s restaurants are franchised to independent entrepreneurs operating under contractual arrangements with the company in the course of the franchise relationship occasional disputes arise between the company and its franchisees relating to a broad range of subjects including but not limited to quality service and cleanliness issues contentions regarding grants or terminations of franchises delinquent payments of rents and fees and franchisee claims for additional 

franchises or rewrites of franchises additionally occasional disputes arise between the company and individuals who claim they should have been granted a mcdonald’s franchise

 hundreds of thousands of people are employed by the company and in restaurants owned and operated by subsidiaries of the company in addition thousands of people from time to time seek employment in such restaurants in the ordinary course of business disputes arise regarding hiring firing promotion and pay practices including wage and hour disputes alleged discrimination and compliance with employment laws

overview 

 

 

description of the business 

the company franchises and operates mcdonald’s restaurants of the 31967 restaurants in 118 countries at yearend 2008 25465 were operated by franchisees including 18402 operated by conventional franchisees 2926 operated by developmental licensees and 4137 operated by foreign affiliated markets affiliates—primarily in japan and 6502 were operated by the company under our conventional franchise arrangement franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment signs seating and décor of their restaurant businesses and by reinvesting in the business over time the company owns the land and building or secures longterm leases for both companyoperated and conventional franchised restaurant sites this maintains longterm occupancy rights helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees under our developmental license arrangement licensees provide capital for the entire business including the real estate interest while the company has no capital invested in addition the company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market 

we view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and continually review our mix of companyoperated and franchised conventional franchised developmental licensed and affiliated restaurants to deliver a great customer experience and drive profitability in most cases franchising is the best way to achieve both goals although direct restaurant operation is more capitalintensive relative to franchising and results in lower restaurant margins as a percent of revenues companyoperated restaurants are important to our success in both mature and developing markets in our companyoperated restaurants and in collaboration with our franchisees we further develop and refine operating standards marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced systemwide in addition we firmly believe that owning restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and essential to providing company personnel with restaurant operations experience our companyoperated business also helps to facilitate strategic changes in restaurant ownership 

the company’s revenues consist of sales by companyoperated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments and initial fees revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales and may include initial fees fees vary by type of site amount of company investment if any and local business conditions these fees along with occupancy and operating rights are stipulated in franchiselicense agreements that generally have 20year terms 

the business is managed as distinct geographic segments significant reportable segments include the united states us europe and asiapacific middle east and africa apmea in addition throughout this report we present “other countries  corporate” that includes operations in canada and latin america as well as corporate activities the us europe and apmea segments account for 34 42 and 18 of total revenues 

respectively france germany and the united kingdom uk collectively account for approximately 55 of europe’s revenues and australia china and japan a 50owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method collectively account for over 50 of apmea’s revenues these six markets along with the us and canada are referred to as “major markets” throughout this report and comprise over 70 of total revenues 

the company continues to focus its management and financial resources on the mcdonald’s restaurant business as we believe the opportunities for longterm growth remain significant accordingly in second quarter 2008 the company sold its minority ownership interest in ukbased pret a manger for 229 million in connection with the sale the company recognized a nonoperating gain during the third quarter 2007 the company sold its investment in boston market in 2006 the company disposed of its investment in chipotle mexican grill chipotle via public stock offerings and a taxfree exchange for mcdonald’s common stock as a result of the disposals during 2007 and 2006 both boston market’s and chipotle’s results of operations and transaction gains have been reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

in analyzing business trends management considers a variety of performance and financial measures including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth systemwide sales growth restaurant margins and returns 

 

  

  



  

  

 strategic direction and financial performance 

the strength of the alignment between the company its franchisees and suppliers collectively referred to as the system has been key to mcdonald’s success over the years this business model enables mcdonald’s to consistently deliver locallyrelevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve in addition it facilitates our ability to identify implement and scale innovative ideas that meet our customers’ changing needs and preferences 

mcdonald’s customercentered plan to win — which is focused on being better not just bigger — provides a common framework for our restaurants yet allows for local adaptation the plan facilitates the execution of multiple initiatives surrounding the five factors of exceptional customer experiences — people products place price and promotion through the execution of these initiatives we have enhanced the mcdonald’s experience for customers worldwide growing sales and guest counts in each of the last five years this plan coupled with financial discipline has delivered strong results for shareholders 

we have exceeded our longterm constant currency financial targets of average annual systemwide sales and revenue growth of 3 to 5 average annual operating income growth of 6 to 7 and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens every year since the plan’s implementation in 2003 after adjusting 2007 for the latin america developmental license transaction given the size and scope of our global business we believe these financial targets are realistic and sustainable enabling us to focus on those opportunities that best optimize longterm shareholder value 

in 2008 we continued to focus on our key global success factors of branded affordability menu variety and beverage choice convenience and daypart expansion ongoing restaurant reinvestment and operations excellence locallyrelevant initiatives around each of these success factors resonated with consumers’ increasingly busy lifestyles and their growing demand for menu variety value and simple enjoyable eatingout experiences as a result every area of the world contributed to 2008 global comparable sales and guest counts increasing 69 and 31 respectively despite a challenging economic environment in many countries 

in the us we continued to drive sales higher and increase our share of the informal eatingout market in 2008 due to our ongoing focus on breakfast chicken beverages convenience and branded affordability we extended our leadership in the breakfast and chicken categories with the launch of the southern style chicken biscuit for breakfast and southern style chicken sandwich for the remainder of the day we profitably built greater visit frequency by leveraging our convenient locations extended hours drivethru service and valueoriented local beverage promotions 

that often featured our popular iced coffee and sweet tea as part of our multiyear strategy to take advantage of the significant and growing beverage category we began rollingout espressobased hot and cold specialty coffees at yearend 2008 over 7000 restaurants were offering the new specialty coffees and we expect to complete the rollout in mid2009 to accommodate the related new equipment as well as enable potential future offerings such as smoothies frappes and bottled beverages construction is required in many restaurants in most cases this construction also involves expanding and optimizing the efficiency of our drivethru booth which enables us to better serve even more customers faster the company is investing capital to fund a portion of this constructionrelated reinvestment for franchised restaurants 

in europe we posted recordhigh comparable sales growth in 2008 every country contributed to this performance which was led by france the uk russia and germany this success was driven in part by greater local customer relevance created by our tiered menu approach featuring an effective combination of premium selections classic menu favorites everyday value and popular limitedtime food promotions we also connected with customers throughout the day with new sandwiches such as the bacon roll for breakfast in the uk and premium m burger in france germany and the uk we continued upgrading the mcdonald’s experience by reimaging more than 650 locations primarily in the uk and germany in addition we continued the rollout of a new kitchen operating system — currently in about 5000 of our european restaurants — to enhance operational efficiency and support greater menu variety open communication and transparency is especially important to european consumers to build brand trust we actively communicated the facts about mcdonald’s as an employer and highlighted the quality and nutrition of our food with the early launch of the company’s new global packaging design 

in apmea our momentum continued with nearly every country delivering positive comparable sales driven by australia japan and china in addition aggressive restaurant development in china — where we opened our 1000th restaurant — contributed to revenue growth our performance was driven by strategic initiatives surrounding convenience breakfast core menu extensions and value we further enhanced mcdonald’s convenience with drivethru and delivery service as well as expansion of extended hours to 60 or about 5000 of our restaurants in apmea we built on the momentum of our breakfast business currently in 70 of our restaurants in apmea by raising customer awareness trial and visit frequency with relevant marketing and new menu offerings like the egg tomato and pepper mcpuff in china we also continued to appeal to customers with branded affordability platforms and locallyrelevant new product launches such as the premium chicken line in australia and new zealand 

our customercentered strategies to drive global momentum also consider price and product mix as a means to enhance restaurant profitability this approach is complemented by a focus on optimizing restaurant operations and effectively managing food and paper costs by leveraging our scale supply chain infrastructure and risk management strategies as a result amid a volatile commodity environment mcdonald’s delivered consolidated companyoperated restaurant margins of 176 – its highest in nine years 

strong sales and margin performance positively impacted growth in cash from operations which rose 1 billion to 59 billion in 2008 our substantial cash flow strong credit rating and continued access to credit provides us significant flexibility to 

  

fund capital expenditures and debt repayments as well as return cash to shareholders 

in 2008 capital expenditures of 21 billion were primarily used to open 995 restaurants 590 net after 405 closings and reimage 1450 locations in addition we believe strongly in returning cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases in 2008 we returned 58 billion to shareholders consisting of 18 billion in dividends and 40 billion in share repurchases this brings total cash returned to 115 billion under our 20072009 15 billion to 17 billion target we are confident we will achieve this cash return target given the ongoing strength and stability of cash from operations and our continued evolution toward a more heavily franchised less capitalintensive business model 

we believe locallyowned and operated restaurants are at the core of our competitive advantage making us not just a global brand but also a locally relevant one in addition an optimized mix of franchised and companyoperated restaurants helps to maximize brand performance and further enhance the reliability of our cash flow and returns to that end in august 2007 the company completed the sale of its businesses in brazil argentina mexico puerto rico venezuela and 13 other countries in latin america and the caribbean which totaled 1571 restaurants to a developmental licensee organization under the new ownership structure the company receives royalties in these markets instead of a combination of companyoperated sales and franchised rents and royalties 

in addition in 2007 we set a threeyear target to refranchise 1000 to 1500 existing companyoperated restaurants between 2008 and 2010 primarily in our major markets in 2008 we refranchised about 675 restaurants increasing the percent of franchised restaurants worldwide to 80 from 78 at yearend 2007 this transition to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants is expected to affect consolidated financial statements as follows

 outlook for 2009 

we will continue to drive success in 2009 and beyond by remaining focused on being better not just bigger we will do so by further enhancing our understanding of consumers’ needs and wants facilitating greater sharing and adoption of best practices and new ideas worldwide and leveraging a strategic approach to implementing initiatives to drive the best bottomline impact 

despite challenging economic conditions the mcdonald’s system is energized by our current worldwide momentum we will continue to build on our strength in five key areas maintaining the balance between price and value maximizing the benefit of available capital by improving the relevance and contemporary feel of our existing restaurants leveraging the equity and unique tastes of core menu favorites like the big mac the quarter pounder with cheese and our worldfamous french fries continuing our financial discipline and evaluation of success measures to ensure these measures are driving actions that positively impact our restaurants and furthering operations excellence by focusing on improved execution as we do so we are confident we can meet or exceed the longterm constant currency financial targets previously discussed 

in the us our 2009 focus is to continue to build relevance and loyalty by staying connected to customers’ needs for menu variety and beverage choice everyday affordability and convenience our initiatives will include reminding customers of the enduring appeal of menu classics such as the big mac and encouraging trial of new sandwich and beverage options including specialty coffees also in 2009 we will continue to offer value across our menu from the dollar menu to our premium products as well as our classic menu favorites and midtier offerings such as our double cheeseburger and snack wraps these initiatives combined with the convenience of our locations optimized drivethru service cashless transactions and longer operating hours will reinforce mcdonald’s position as our customers’ preferred place and way to eat 

our priorities in europe remain upgrading the customer and employee experience enhancing local relevance and building brand transparency in 2009 we will continue upgrading our restaurants’ ambiance through reimaging including adding another 200 mccafes primarily in germany and france in addition we will focus on optimizing our drivethru service completing the conversion of our kitchen operating system in most european restaurants and increasing total locations offering extended and 24hour service we also will strengthen our local relevance by complementing our tiered menu with new products and a relevant variety of limitedtime food events featuring beef chicken desserts and coffee selections in the area of brand transparency we will remain open and accessible and will continue to inform consumers about our food quality and reputation as an employer 

in apmea our goal is to be consumers’ first choice when eating out to achieve this goal locallyrelevant strategies surrounding convenience breakfast and branded affordability are essential in this diverse and dynamic part of the world convenience initiatives include leveraging the success of 24hour or extended operating hours offering delivery service and building our drivethru 

  

traffic we will also aggressively continue to open new restaurants in china we will further build our breakfast business in apmea by increasing the number of locations where it is served utilizing innovative marketing support and launching new products at the same time we will continue to highlight our classic menu favorites and offer locallyrelevant extensions of these products in addition we are further leveraging a strategic pricing tool to optimize menu prices to drive sales and profits 

in 2009 we will continue to optimize the mix of franchised and companyoperated restaurants and will refranchise restaurants under the previously mentioned target the speed with which we make progress toward this goal will depend on our ability to identify the appropriate prospective franchisees with the experience and financial resources in the relevant markets we will also continue to evaluate several small markets in apmea and europe for potential transition to developmental license structures we will only convert such markets when we believe that we have identified a qualified licensee and our business is ready for transition to optimize the transaction for the longterm 

as previously discussed our evolution toward a more heavily franchised less capitalintensive business model has favorable implications for the amount of capital we invest the strength and stability of our cash flow and our longterm returns as a result we expect free cash flow — cash from operations less capital expenditures — will continue to grow and be a significant source to fund total cash returned to shareholders in addition we expect our share repurchase activity will continue to yield reductions in our outstanding share count 

finally we will continue to be disciplined financially remaining diligent about how and where we invest capital and selling general and administrative expenses to grow our business consistent with the last few years to drive sales and returns we will allocate nearly 50 of our 21 billion of planned 2009 capital expenditures toward reinvestments in existing restaurants mainly related to the reimaging of locations in europe and the rollout of the beverage strategy in the us the remainder of our capital expenditures will primarily be used to build new locations

in august 2007 the company completed the sale of its businesses in brazil argentina mexico puerto rico venezuela and 13 other countries in latin america and the caribbean which totaled 1571 restaurants to a developmental licensee organization the company refers to these markets as “latam” as a result of the latam transaction the company receives royalties in these markets instead of a combination of companyoperated sales and franchised rents and royalties 

based on approval by the company’s board of directors on april 17 2007 the company concluded latam was “held for sale” as of that date in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets as a result the company recorded an impairment charge of 17 billion in 2007 substantially all of which was noncash the charge included 896 million for the difference between the net book value of the latam business and approximately 675 million in cash proceeds received this loss in value was primarily due to a historically difficult economic environment coupled with volatility experienced in many of the markets included in this transaction the charges also included historical foreign currency translation losses of 769 million recorded in shareholders’ equity 

the company recorded a tax benefit of 62 million in 2007 in connection with this transaction as a result of meeting the “held for sale” criteria the company ceased recording depreciation expense with respect to latam effective april 17 2007 in connection with the sale the company agreed to indemnify the buyers for certain tax and other claims certain of which are reflected as liabilities on mcdonald’s consolidated balance sheet totaling 142 million at december 31 2008 and 179 million at december 31 2007 the change in the balance was primarily due to foreign currency translation the company mitigates the currency impact to income through the use of forward foreign exchange agreements 

the buyers of the company’s operations in latam entered into a 20year master franchise agreement that requires the buyers among other obligations to i pay monthly royalties commencing at a rate of approximately 5 of gross sales of the restaurants in these markets substantially consistent with market rates for similar license arrangements ii commit to adding approximately 150 new mcdonald’s restaurants by the end of 2010 and pay an initial fee for each new restaurant opened and iii commit to specified annual capital expenditures for existing restaurants 

  

in addition to the consolidated operating results shown on the previous page consolidated results for 2007 and adjusted growth rates for 2008 and 2007 are presented in the following table excluding the impact of the latam transaction these results include the effect of foreign currency translation further discussed in the section titled impact of foreign currency translation on reported results while the company has converted certain other markets to a developmental license arrangement management believes the latam transaction and the associated charge are not indicative of ongoing operations due to the size and scope of the transaction management believes that the adjusted operating results better reflect the underlying business trends relevant to the periods presented

in 2007 net income and diluted net income per common share were 24 billion and 198 income from continuing operations was 23 billion or 193 per share which included 16 billion or 130 per share of net expense related to the latam transaction this reflects an impairment charge of 132 per share partly offset by a 002 per share benefit due to eliminating depreciation on the assets in latam in midapril 2007 in accordance with accounting rules in addition 2007 results included a net tax benefit of 288 million or 024 per share resulting from the completion of an irs examination of the company’s 20032004 us federal income tax returns partly offset by the impact of a tax law change 

in canada income from discontinued operations was 60 million or 005 per share

impact of foreign currency translation on reported results 

while changing foreign currencies affect reported results mcdonald’s mitigates exposures where practical by financing in local currencies hedging certain foreigndenominated cash flows and purchasing goods and services in local currencies 

in 2008 foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results driven by the stronger euro and most other currencies partly offset by the weaker british pound however in fourth quarter 2008 the us dollar strengthened significantly against nearly every foreign currency reducing the full year foreign currency benefit due to this strengthening full year 2009 revenues and operating income will likely be negatively impacted by foreign currency translation in 2007 foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results primarily driven by the stronger euro british pound australian dollar and canadian dollar in 2006 consolidated operating results were positively impacted by the stronger euro canadian dollar and british pound

 revenues 

the company’s revenues consist of sales by companyoperated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments and initial fees revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales and may include initial fees 

in both 2008 and 2007 consolidated revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales as well as stronger foreign currencies revenue growth in both years was negatively impacted by the latam transaction upon completion of the latam transaction in august 2007 the company receives royalties based on a percent of sales in these markets instead of a combination of companyoperated sales and franchised rents and royalties revenue growth in 2008 was also partly offset by the impact of the refranchising strategy in certain of the company’s major markets which resulted in a higher proportion of franchised restaurants compared with 2007 

revenues 

 

 

   

in the us the increases in revenues in 2008 and 2007 were primarily driven by our marketleading breakfast business and the ongoing appeal of new products as well as continued focus on everyday value and convenience new products introduced in 2008 included southern style chicken products iced coffee and sweet tea while new products introduced in 2007 included the southwest salad and an extended snack wrap line in 2008 revenue growth was largely offset by the impact of the refranchising strategy 

europe’s constant currency increase in revenues in 2008 and 2007 was primarily due to strong comparable sales in russia which is entirely companyoperated france and the uk as well as positive comparable sales in all other markets these increases were partly offset by the impact of the refranchising strategy primarily in the uk and germany in 2008 and in the uk in 2007 

in apmea the constant currency increases in revenues in 2008 and 2007 were primarily driven by strong comparable sales in australia and china as well as positive comparable sales throughout the segment in addition expansion in china contributed to the increases in both years 

in other countries  corporate companyoperated sales declined in 2008 and 2007 while franchised revenues increased primarily as a result of the latam transaction in august 2007 

the following tables present systemwide sales and comparable sales increases

 restaurant margins 

the company continues to optimize its restaurant ownership mix cash flow and returns through its refranchising strategy and expects the shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants to negatively impact consolidated revenues as companyoperated sales shift to franchised sales where we receive rent andor royalties in addition the company expects a decrease in companyoperated margin dollars and an increase in franchised margin dollars while margin percentages will vary based on sales and cost structures of refranchised restaurants 

  

 franchised margin dollars represent revenues from franchised restaurants less the company’s occupancy costs rent and depreciation associated with those sites franchised margin dollars represented about 65 of the combined restaurant margins in 2008 2007 and 2006 franchised margin dollars increased 695 million or 14 11 in constant currencies in 2008 and 601 million or 14 10 in constant currencies in 2007 the august 2007 latam transaction contributed to the growth in franchised margin dollars in both 2008 and 2007 and the refranchising strategy contributed to the growth in 2008 

franchised margins 

 

 

 in the us and apmea the franchised margin percent increases in 2008 and 2007 were primarily driven by positive comparable sales in 2008 the us franchised margin percent was negatively impacted by the refranchising strategy 

europe’s franchised margin percent increased in 2008 and 2007 primarily due to strong comparable sales in most markets partly offset by the impact of the refranchising strategy higher rent expense and the cost of strategic brand and sales building initiatives also negatively affected the franchised margin percent in 2008 the company will continue to execute these strategies which are designed to drive comparable guest count growth and long term profitability and are expected to negatively impact the 2009 franchised margin percent 

in other countries  corporate the franchised margin percent increased in 2008 and 2007 as a result of the latam transaction the company receives royalties based on a percent of sales in these markets 

the franchised margin percent in apmea and beginning in 2008 other countries  corporate is higher relative to the us and europe due to a large proportion of developmental licensed andor affiliated restaurants where we have royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs 

 

 companyoperated margin dollars represent sales by companyoperated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants companyoperated margin dollars increased 39 million or 1 decreased 1 in constant currencies in 2008 and increased 372 million or 15 10 in constant currencies in 2007 after the latam transaction in august 2007 there are no companyoperated restaurants remaining in latin america companyoperated margin dollars were negatively impacted by this transaction in 2008 and 2007 and by the refranchising strategy in 

  

2008 the refranchising strategy had a positive impact on the margin percent in 2008 primarily in the us and europe 

companyoperated margins 

 

 

 in the us the companyoperated margin percent decreased in 2008 and 2007 due to cost pressures including higher commodity and labor costs partly offset by positive comparable sales 

europe’s companyoperated margin percent increased in 2008 and 2007 primarily due to strong comparable sales partly offset by higher commodity and labor costs 

in apmea the companyoperated margin percent in 2008 and 2007 increased due to strong comparable sales in most markets both years were negatively impacted by higher labor costs and 2008 was also negatively impacted by higher commodity costs 

in other countries  corporate the companyoperated margin in 2007 benefited by about 100 basis points related to the discontinuation of depreciation on the assets in latam from midapril through july 2007 

 

 we continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance profits and returns in most cases franchising is the best way to achieve these goals but as previously stated companyoperated restaurants are also important to our success 

we report results for companyoperated restaurants based on their sales less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs we report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues less associated occupancy costs for this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure we do not specifically allocate selling general  administrative expenses and other operating income expenses to companyoperated or franchised restaurants other operating items that relate to the companyoperated restaurants generally include gains on sales of restaurant businesses and writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements 

we believe the following information about companyoperated restaurants in our most significant markets provides an additional perspective on this business management responsible for our companyoperated restaurants in these markets analyzes the companyoperated business on this basis to assess its performance management of the company also considers this information when evaluating restaurant ownership mix subject to other relevant considerations 

the following tables seek to illustrate the two components of our companyoperated margins the first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations which we refer to below as “store operating margin” the second relates to the value of our brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and royalties we refer to this component as “brandreal estate margin” both companyoperated and conventional franchised restaurants are charged rent and royalties although rent and royalties for companyoperated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation rent and royalties for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales and the actual rent percentage varies depending on the level of mcdonald’s investment in the restaurant royalty rates may also vary by market 

as shown in the following tables in disaggregating the components of our companyoperated margins certain costs with respect to companyoperated restaurants are reflected in brandreal estate margin those costs consist of rent payable by mcdonald’s to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of occupancy  other operating expenses recorded on the consolidated statement of income store operating margins reflect rent and royalty expenses and those amounts are accounted for as income in calculating brandreal estate margin 

while we believe that the following information provides a perspective in evaluating our companyoperated business it is not intended as a measure of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating income or restaurant margins as reported by the company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us in particular as noted above we do not allocate selling general  administrative expenses to our companyoperated business however we believe that a range of 40000 to 50000 per restaurant on average is a typical range of costs to support this business in the us the actual costs in markets outside the us will vary depending on local circumstances and the organizational structure of the market these costs reflect the indirect services we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant

adjusted debt a term that is commonly used by the rating agencies referred to above includes debt outstanding on the company’s balance sheet plus an adjustment to capitalize operating leases based on their most recent calculations these agencies add between 6 billion and 12 billion to debt for lease capitalization purposes which increases total debt as a percent of total capitalization and reduces cash provided by operations as a percent of total debt for credit rating purposes the company believes the rating agency methodology for capitalizing leases requires certain adjustments these adjustments include excluding percent rents in excess of minimum rents excluding certain companyoperated restaurant lease agreements outside the us that are cancelable with minimal penalties representing approximately 30 of companyoperated restaurant minimum rents outside the us based on the company’s estimate capitalizing nonrestaurant leases using a multiple of three times rent expense and reducing total rent expense by a percentage of the annual minimum rent payments due to the company from franchisees operating on leased sites based on this calculation for credit analysis purposes approximately 4 billion to 5 billion of future operating lease payments would be capitalized

foreign currency net asset exposures 

 

 

 the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the company’s results of operations cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments the interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10 in the same direction relative to the us dollar on all financial instruments however the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the us based on the results of these analyses of the company’s financial instruments neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2008 levels nor a 10 adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2008 levels would materially affect the company’s results of operations cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments 

  

contractual obligations and commitments 

the company has longterm contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations related to both companyoperated and franchised restaurants and debt obligations in addition the company has longterm revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements cash provided by operations including cash provided by these franchise arrangements along with the company’s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations the following table summarizes the company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the company under existing franchise arrangements as of december 31 2008 see discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details

other matters 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions 

the company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

 

 property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straightline basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets taking into account anticipated technological or other changes the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors economic factors and industry trends if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense or writeoffs in future periods 

 

 the company has a sharebased compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equitybased incentives including stock options and restricted stock units rsus to employees and nonemployee directors the expense for these equitybased incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period 

the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closedform pricing model the pricing model requires assumptions such as the expected life of the stock option the riskfree interest rate and expected volatility of the company’s stock over the expected life which significantly impact the assumed fair value the company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants sharebased compensation expense will fluctuate in future years the fair value of each rsu granted is equal to the market price of the company’s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period 

 

 longlived assets including goodwill are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in assessing the recoverability of the company’s longlived assets the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the company’s experience and knowledge of its operations these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions operating costs inflation competition and consumer and demographic trends a key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales if the company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future the company may be required to record impairment charges 

when the company sells an existing business to a developmental licensee it determines when these businesses are “held for sale” in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets  impairment charges on assets held for sale are recognized when 

  

management and if required the company’s board of directors have approved and committed to a plan to dispose of the assets the assets are available for disposal the disposal is probable of occurring within 12 months and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than the assets’ net book value among other factors an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the net book value of the business including foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity and the estimated cash sales price less costs of disposal 

an alternative accounting policy would be to recharacterize some or all of any loss as an intangible asset and amortize it to expense over future periods based on the term of the relevant licensing arrangement and as revenue is recognized for royalties and initial fees under this alternative for the 2007 latam transaction approximately 900 million of the 17 billion impairment charge could have been recharacterized as an intangible asset and amortized over the franchise term of 20 years resulting in about 45 million of expense annually this policy would be based on a view that the consideration for the sale consists of two components–the cash sales price and the future royalties and initial fees 

the company bases its accounting policy on management’s determination that royalties payable under its developmental license arrangements are substantially consistent with market rates for similar license arrangements the company does not believe it would be appropriate to recognize an asset for the right to receive marketbased fees in future periods particularly given the continuing support and services provided to the licensees therefore the company believes that the recognition of an impairment charge based on the net cash sales price reflects the substance of the sale transaction 

 

 from time to time the company is subject to proceedings lawsuits and other claims related to competitors customers employees franchisees government agencies intellectual property shareholders and suppliers the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses a determination of the amount of accrual required if any for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters the company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 

 

 the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies including the sale of appreciated assets in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if these estimates and assumptions change in the future the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance this could result in a charge to or an increase in income in the period such determination is made 

in addition the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter during 2008 the irs examination of the company’s 20052006 us tax returns was completed the tax provision impact associated with the 

completion of this examination was not significant during 2007 the company recorded a 316 million benefit as a result of the completion of an irs examination of the company’s 20032004 us tax returns the company’s 2007 us tax return is currently under examination and the completion of the examination which will ultimately include the 2008 us tax return is expected in 2011 

deferred us income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling 69 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures the temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the us if management’s intentions change in the future deferred taxes may need to be provided 

effects of changing prices—inflation 

although inflationary cost pressures increased globally in 2008 the company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively this is because of rapid inventory turnover the ability to adjust menu prices cost controls and substantial property holdings many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation 

reconciliation of returns on incremental invested capital 

return on incremental invested capital roiic is a measure reviewed by management over oneyear and threeyear time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital this measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation the numerator is the company’s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period adjusted for the impact of the latam transaction in 2007 while the company has converted certain other markets to a developmental license arrangement management believes the latam transaction and the associated charge are not indicative of ongoing operations due to the size and scope of the transaction management believes that the adjusted operating results better reflect the underlying business trends relevant to the periods presented 

the denominator is the weightedaverage adjusted cash used for investing activities during the applicable one or threeyear period adjusted cash used for investing activities is defined as cash used for investing activities less cash generated from investing activities related to the boston market chipotle latam and pret a manger transactions the weightedaverage adjusted cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis these weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter’s investing activities to incremental operating income for example fourth quarter 2008 investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income 125 of fourth quarter 2008 investing activities are included in the oneyear and threeyear calculations in contrast fourth quarter 2007 is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago and therefore have a full year impact on 2008 operating income with little or no impact to the base period 875 and 1000 of fourth quarter 2007 investing activities are included in the oneyear and threeyear calculations respectively management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average 

  

the reconciliations to the most comparable measurements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us for the numerator and denominator of the oneyear and threeyear roiic are as follows

 item 1a risk factors and cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements 

this report includes forwardlooking statements about our plans and future performance including those under outlook for 2008 these statements use such words as “may” “will” “expect” “believe” and “plan” they reflect our expectations and speak only as of the date of this report we do not undertake to update them our expectations or the underlying assumptions may change or not be realized and you should not rely unduly on forwardlooking statements 

our business and execution of our strategic plan the plan to win are subject to risks by far the most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our customers and a brand they trust meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our operating environment the informal eating out segment of the restaurant industry although largely mature in our major markets is also highly fragmented and competitive we have the added challenge of the cultural economic and regulatory differences that exist among the more than 100 countries where we operate we also face risk in adapting our business model in particular markets the decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise developmental license or joint venture agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex and changing regulatory and similar initiatives around the world have also become more wideranging and prescriptive and affect how we operate and our results in particular increasing focus on nutritional content and on the production processing and preparation of food “from field to front counter” presents challenges for our brand and may adversely affect our results 

these risks can have an impact both in the nearand longterm and are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe are most likely to affect our performance 

our ability to remain a relevant and trusted brand and to increase sales depends largely on how well we execute the plan to win 

we developed the plan to win to address the key drivers of our business and results—people products place price and promotion the quality of our execution depends mainly on the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

our results and financial condition are affected by our ownership mix and whether we can achieve a mix that optimizes margins and returns while meeting our business needs and customer expectations 

in recent years we have reduced the number of companyoperated restaurants and we are planning further reductions by franchising companyoperated restaurants or entering into developmental license agreements whether and when we can achieve these plans as well as their success is uncertain and will be affected by the following 

 

  

  

  

 our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions which can adversely affect our sales margins and net income 

our results of operations are substantially affected not only by global economic conditions but also by local operating and economic conditions which can vary substantially by market unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market and may prompt promotional or other actions that adversely affect our margins constrain our operating flexibility or result in charges restaurant closings or sales of companyoperated restaurants whether we can manage this risk effectively depends mainly on the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 increasing regulatory complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways 

our legal and regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance litigation and similar risks that affect our operations and results in material ways in many of our markets including the united states and europe we are subject to increasing regulation which has increased our cost of doing business in developing markets we face the risks associated with new and untested laws and judicial systems among the more important regulatory and litigation risks we face are the following 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 the trading volatility and price of our common stock may be affected by many factors 

many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects the most important of these some of which are outside our control are 

 

  

  

 our results can be adversely affected by disruptions or events such as the impact of severe weather conditions and natural disasters 

severe weather conditions terrorist activities health epidemics or pandemics or the prospect of these events can have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels and in turn the mcdonald’s system and our results and prospects in the affected markets our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain for these purposes may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

description of the business 

the company primarily franchises and operates mcdonald’s restaurants of the 31377 restaurants in 118 countries at yearend 2007 20505 are operated by franchisees including 2781 operated by developmental licensees 3966 are operated by affiliates and 6906 are operated by the company under our conventional franchise arrangement franchisees provide a portion of the required capital by initially investing in the equipment signs seating and décor of their restaurant businesses and by reinvesting in the business over time the company owns the land and building or secures longterm leases for both companyoperated and conventional franchised restaurant sites this ensures longterm occupancy rights helps control related costs and improves alignment with franchisees under our developmental license arrangement licensees provide capital for the entire business including the real estate interest while the company generally has no capital invested 

we view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and continually review our restaurant ownership mix that is our mix among companyoperated franchised conventional or developmental license and affiliated to deliver a great customer experience and drive profitability in most cases franchising is the best way to achieve both goals although direct restaurant operation is more capitalintensive relative to franchising and results in lower restaurant margins as a percent of revenues companyoperated restaurants are important to our success in both mature and developing markets in our companyoperated restaurants and in collaboration with our franchisees we further develop and refine operating standards marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced systemwide in addition we firmly believe that owning restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and essential to providing company personnel with restaurant operations experience our companyoperated business also helps to facilitate changes in restaurant ownership as warranted by strategic considerations 

revenues consist of sales by companyoperated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates these fees primarily include rent andor royalties that are based on a percent of sales with specified minimum rent payments along with initial fees fees vary by type of site amount of company investment and local business conditions these fees along with occupancy and operating rights are stipulated in franchiselicense agreements that generally have 20year terms 

the business is managed as distinct geographic segments significant reportable segments include the united states us europe and asiapacific middle east and africa apmea in addition throughout this report we present “other countries  corporate” that includes operations in canada and latin america as well as corporate activities and certain investments the us europe and apmea segments account for 35 39 and 16 of total revenues respectively france germany and the united kingdom uk collectively account for approximately 60 of europe’s revenues and australia china and japan a 50owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method collectively account for over 50 of apmea’s revenues these six markets along with the us and canada are referred to as “major markets” throughout this report and comprise over 70 of total revenues 

the company continues to focus its management and financial resources on the mcdonald’s restaurant business as we believe the opportunities for longterm growth remain significant accordingly during the third quarter 2007 the company sold its investment in boston market in 2006 the company disposed of its investment in chipotle mexican grill chipotle via public stock offerings and a taxfree exchange for mcdonald’s common stock as a result of the disposals during 2007 and 2006 both boston market’s and chipotle’s results of operations and transaction gains have been reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

in analyzing business trends management considers a variety of performance and financial measures including comparable sales growth systemwide sales growth restaurant margins and returns 

 

  

  

   

 strategic direction and financial performance 

the unique business relationship among the company its franchisees and suppliers collectively referred to as the system has been key to mcdonald’s success over the years this business model enables mcdonald’s to play an integral role in the communities we serve and consistently deliver relevant restaurant experiences to customers in addition it facilitates our ability to implement innovative ideas and profitably grow our business worldwide 

since implementing the customercentered plan to win several years ago our focus has been on being better not just bigger our strategic alignment behind this plan has created better mcdonald’s experiences through the execution of multiple initiatives surrounding the five factors of exceptional customer experiences — people products place price and promotion while our focus has remained the same we have adapted and evolved our initiatives based on the changing needs and preferences of our customers 

these multiple initiatives have increased our consumer relevance and contributed to sales and guest counts worldwide increasing every year since 2003 as a result we have met or exceeded our longterm financial targets excluding the 2007 impact of the sale of 18 latin american and caribbean markets to a developmental licensee these targets which exclude the impact of foreign currency translation include average annual systemwide sales and revenue growth of 3 to 5 average annual operating income growth of 6 to 7 and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens we believe our financial targets are realistic and sustainable and enable our management to focus on those opportunities that best optimize longterm shareholder value 

in 2007 we built on our strong performance by focusing on what consumer insights indicate are key drivers of our global business today — convenience branded affordability daypart expansion and menu choice leveraging our ability to replicate and scale success in these areas worldwide we drove global comparable sales up 68 and extended the number of consecutive monthly increases to 56 through december 2007 

in the us our momentum continued as we further built on our marketleading breakfast business introduced new products such as the southwest salad cinnamon melts and the mcskillet burrito extended our snack wrap line and offered greater beverage choices including premium roast iced coffee and sweet tea these initiatives along with longer operating hours and everyday value resonated with consumers to drive increased customer visits and increased sales in addition our efforts to strengthen employee engagement and optimize efficiency in the drivethru and at breakfast helped us to better serve even more customers 

in europe we sustained strong sales growth in virtually every country primary contributors to this performance included france germany russia and the uk our success in europe was driven by continued execution along three key priorities upgrading the customer and employee experience building brand transparency and enhancing local relevance key initiatives included reimaging more than 600 locations actively communicating mcdonald’s food quality nutrition and employment facts and implementing a new kitchen operating system which is now in over half of our european restaurants to enhance operational efficiency and support greater menu variety in addition we satisfied consumer desire for choice and value with locallyrelevant menus that feature a blend of premium sandwiches and salads classic menu favorites new products limitedtime food promotions as well as everyday value offerings 

in apmea our business posted strong sales performance driven by positive comparable sales in nearly every country led by japan australia and china in addition restaurant expansion in china — where we believe our growth potential is significant — contributed to revenue and operating income growth throughout apmea we enhanced our convenience by increasing the number of restaurants offering 24hours or extended hours of service to approximately 4500 we also continued to deliver value to customers through branded affordability platforms and offer menu choice and variety with locallyrelevant core menu extensions such as the teriyaki mac in japan and variations of the filetofish in china in addition we invigorated our breakfast business in apmea with the national launch of breakfast in china and the introduction of mcgriddles sandwiches in japan 

strong global performance generated 49 billion of cash from operations in 2007 about 19 billion of this cash was invested in our business primarily to reimage existing restaurants and build new ones for 2007 through 2009 the company expects to return 15 billion to 17 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends subject to business and market conditions in 2007 we increased our annual dividend 50 to 150 per share — more than six times higher than the amount paid in 2002 — and repurchased over 77 million shares for 39 billion 

in 2007 we took a number of steps to strengthen management’s focus on the core mcdonald’s business and those markets that have the largest impact on results we sold our investment in boston market in 2007 receiving proceeds of approximately 250 million in addition the company retained about 50 sites the majority of which will be converted to mcdonald’s restaurants we also made significant progress enhancing the mix of franchised and companyoperated restaurants including executing our developmental license strategy to maximize longterm brand performance and returns 

under a developmental license a local entrepreneur owns the business including controlling the real estate and uses hisher capital and local knowledge to build the mcdonald’s brand and optimize longterm sales and profitability the company collects a royalty which varies by market based on a percent of sales but does not invest any capital for new restaurants or reinvestments we have successfully used this structure for more than 15 years and had it in place in 59 countries at yearend 2007 

in august 2007 we completed the transition of 1571 restaurants in brazil argentina mexico puerto rico 

  

venezuela and 13 other countries in latin america and the caribbean to a developmental license structure the company refers to these markets as “latam” 

based on approval by the company’s board of directors on april 17 2007 the company concluded latam was “held for sale” as of that date in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets as a result the company recorded an impairment charge of 17 billion in 2007 substantially all of which was noncash the charge included 896 million for the difference between the net book value of the latam business and approximately 675 million in cash proceeds received this loss in value was primarily due to a historically difficult economic environment coupled with volatility experienced in many of the markets included in this transaction the charges also included historical foreign currency translation losses of 769 million recorded in shareholders’ equity the company recorded a tax benefit of 62 million in connection with this transaction as a result of meeting the “held for sale” criteria the company ceased recording depreciation expense with respect to latam effective april 17 2007 in connection with the sale the company has agreed to indemnify the buyers for certain tax and other claims certain of which are reflected as liabilities in mcdonald’s consolidated balance sheet totaling 179 million at yearend 2007 

the buyers of the company’s operations in latam have entered into a 20year master franchise agreement that requires the buyers among other obligations to i pay monthly royalties commencing at a rate of approximately 5 of gross sales of the restaurants in these markets substantially consistent with market rates for similar license arrangements ii commit to adding approximately 150 new mcdonald’s restaurants over the first three years and pay an initial fee for each new restaurant opened and iii commit to specified annual capital expenditures for existing restaurants 

in addition we transitioned another five small markets in europe with a total of 24 restaurants to the developmental license structure in 2007 

we also made progress franchising certain companyoperated restaurants in key markets as a result of our developmental license strategy and franchising initiatives the percent of franchised and affiliated restaurants worldwide increased from 74 at yearend 2006 to 78 at yearend 2007

 outlook for 2008 

the mcdonald’s system is energized by our current worldwide momentum we intend to build on this momentum by continuing to execute our plan to win with its strategic focus on our customers and restaurants while exercising disciplined financial management as we do so we are confident we will continue to meet or exceed the longterm financial targets previously discussed 

we will continue to drive success in 2008 and beyond by leveraging key consumer insights and our global experience while relying on our strengths in developing testing and implementing initiatives surrounding our global business drivers of convenience branded affordability daypart expansion and menu variety 

in the us our key areas of focus will be breakfast chicken beverages and convenience in 2008 we expect to build on our breakfast momentum and at the same time extend our leadership in the chicken category with the launch of the southern style chicken biscuit sandwich for breakfast and the southern style chicken sandwich for the remainder of the day we will also continue to provide value and convenience to solidify our connection with consumer lifestyles in addition as part of a comprehensive multiyear beverage business strategy designed to take advantage of the significant and growing beverage category we will begin introducing hot specialty coffee offerings in 2008 on a marketbymarket basis it will not be until late 2009 when we will begin to recognize the full sales benefit of our beverage opportunity this first component of our beverage business may require construction new equipment new processes and training in our restaurants all of which will serve as a platform for the anticipated future introduction of smoothies frappes and other beverage options 

in europe we plan to strengthen our local relevance using a tiered menu approach featuring premium selections classic menu favorites and everyday affordable offerings we will complement these with new products and limitedtime food promotions developed in our european food studio building greater brand transparency will remain a priority in europe especially in the uk with ongoing communication efforts highlighting the quality of our food and building our reputation as an employer of choice we will also create stronger bonds of trust by being accessible and maintaining an open dialogue with customers and key stakeholders as part of our efforts to upgrade the customer experience we will continue remodeling additional restaurants in the uk and germany in germany an integral part of our reimaging program includes adding about 100 mccafes in 2008 we will also continue installing our new kitchen operating system to ensure that we can consistently deliver high food quality with a goal for this new system to be in virtually all of our european restaurants by the end of 2009 

in apmea locallyrelevant execution of our strategies surrounding convenience breakfast core menu extensions and value is essential to sustaining momentum in this diverse and dynamic part of the world convenience initiatives include leveraging the success of 24hours or extended hours of service offering delivery service in certain countries and building our drivethru business particularly in china in addition we will continue to emphasize breakfast to further build this daypart communicate our everyday value offerings and feature limitedtime variations of classic menu favorites 

  

we believe locallyowned and operated restaurants are at the core of our competitive advantage and make us not just a global brand but a locally relevant one to that end we continually evaluate ownership structures in our markets to maximize brand performance and further enhance the reliability of our cash flow and returns we completed a detailed analysis of the appropriate ownership mix in key markets around the world taking into account our plans for each of those markets the risks associated with operating in the market and restaurantlevel results this analysis also considered the current legal and regulatory environment which in some countries such as china and russia may make it prudent for the company to own and operate the restaurants based on this analysis we expect to refranchise a total of 1000 to 1500 existing companyoperated restaurants primarily in our major markets over the next three or more years this will be dependent on our ability to identify the appropriate prospective franchisees with the experience and financial resources in the relevant markets 

in addition we will continue to evaluate several small markets in apmea and europe for potential transition to developmental license structures we will only convert such markets when we believe that we have identified a qualified licensee and our business is ready for transition to optimize the transaction for the long term 

our evolution toward a more heavily franchised less capitalintensive business model has favorable implications for the amount of capital we invest the strength and stability of our cash flow and for our returns as a result we expect free cash flow — cash from operations less capital expenditures — will continue to grow and be a significant source of cash used to fund our total cash returned to shareholders target for 2007 through 2009 of 15 billion to 17 billion in addition we expect our share repurchase activity will continue to yield reductions in the share count in the years ahead 

while the company does not provide specific guidance on net income per share the following information is provided to assist in analyzing the company’s results

in addition to the consolidated operating results shown above consolidated results for 2007 are presented in the following table excluding the impact of the latam developmental license transaction while the company has previously converted certain other markets to a developmental license structure management believes the latam transaction and the associated charge are not indicative of ongoing operations due to the size and scope of the transaction management believes that the adjusted operating results better reflect the underlying business trends relevant to the periods presented

impact of foreign currency translation on reported results 

while changing foreign currencies affect reported results mcdonald’s mitigates exposures where practical by financing in local currencies hedging certain foreigndenominated cash flows and purchasing goods and services in local currencies 

in 2007 foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated revenues operating income net income and net income per share primarily driven by the stronger euro british pound australian dollar and canadian dollar in 2006 consolidated revenues operating income and net income were positively impacted by the stronger euro canadian dollar and british pound consolidated revenues in 2006 were also positively impacted by the stronger brazilian real in 2005 consolidated revenues were positively impacted by the brazilian real and the canadian dollar but operating income and net income were minimally impacted by foreign currency translation 

 

 revenues 

in both 2007 and 2006 consolidated revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales as well as stronger foreign currencies revenue growth in 2007 was partly offset by the company’s sale of its latam businesses upon completion of the latam sale in august 2007 the company receives royalties based on a percent of sales in these markets 

 

  

   

in the us the increases in revenues in 2007 and 2006 were primarily driven by our marketleading breakfast business and the ongoing appeal of new products as well as continued focus on everyday value and convenience new products introduced in 2007 included the southwest salad and an extended snack wrap line while new products introduced in 2006 included snack wraps and the asian salad 

europe’s constant currency increase in revenues in 2007 was primarily due to strong comparable sales in france russia which is entirely companyoperated the uk and germany as well as positive comparable sales throughout the segment in 2006 the increase in revenues was due to strong comparable sales in france germany and russia in addition revenues in 2006 benefited from positive comparable sales in the uk which were partly offset by the impact of closing certain companyoperated restaurants the increases for both 2007 and 2006 were partly offset by a higher proportion of franchised and affiliated restaurants compared with the prior year primarily due to sales of companyoperated restaurants in conjunction with our overall franchising strategy specifically in the uk 

in apmea the constant currency increase in revenues in 2007 was primarily driven by strong comparable sales in china and australia as well as positive comparable sales in substantially all other markets in addition expansion in china contributed to the increase in 2006 the increase in revenues was primarily driven by the consolidation of malaysia for financial reporting purposes due to an increase in the company’s ownership during the first quarter 2006 expansion and positive comparable sales in china as well as positive comparable sales in most markets the increase was partly offset by the 2005 conversion of the philippines and turkey about 325 restaurants to developmental license structures 

in other countries  corporate companyoperated sales declined in 2007 while franchised and affiliated revenues increased as a result of the completion of the latam transaction in august 2007 

the following tables present systemwide sales growth rates and the increase in comparable sales 

 

  

 restaurant margins 

 

 franchised margin dollars represent revenues from franchised and affiliated restaurants less the company’s occupancy costs rent and depreciation associated with those sites franchised margin dollars represented about 65 of the combined restaurant margins in 2007 2006 and 2005 franchised margin dollars increased 601 million or 14 10 in constant currencies in 2007 and 357 million or 9 8 in constant currencies in 2006 the us and europe segments accounted for about 85 of the franchised margin dollars in all three years 

 

 the consolidated franchised margin percent increased in 2007 and 2006 due to strong comparable sales the 2007 increase in franchised margin for other countries  corporate is primarily due to the sale of latam in august 2007 as a result of the sale the company receives royalties based on a percent of sales in these markets 

 

 companyoperated margin dollars represent sales by companyoperated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants companyoperated margin dollars increased 372 million or 15 10 in constant currencies in 2007 and increased 398 million or 19 17 in constant currencies in 2006 the us and europe segments accounted for more than 70 of the companyoperated margin dollars in all three years 

 

   

in the us the companyoperated margin percent decreased in 2007 due to cost pressures including higher commodity and labor costs partly offset by positive comparable sales in 2006 the companyoperated margin percent increased due to positive comparable sales partly offset by higher labor costs commodity costs and utilities 

europe’s companyoperated margin percent increased in 2007 primarily due to strong comparable sales partly offset by higher labor and commodity costs in 2006 the companyoperated margin percent increased due to strong comparable sales partly offset by higher labor costs in addition initiatives in the uk such as the closing of certain underperforming restaurants in the first quarter 2006 and the sales of companyoperated restaurants to franchisees and affiliates contributed to the increases in 2006 and to a lesser extent 2007 

in apmea the companyoperated margin percent in 2007 increased due to strong comparable sales partly offset by higher labor costs in both years the companyoperated margin percent reflected improved results in china and many other markets 

in other countries  corporate the companyoperated margin in 2007 reflected latam operations through july 2007 and the benefit due to the discontinuation of depreciation on the assets in latam from midapril through july 2007 

 

 we continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance profits and returns in most cases franchising is the best way to achieve these goals although direct restaurant operation is significantly more capitalintensive relative to franchising and results in lower restaurant margins as a percent of revenues companyoperated restaurants are important to our success in both mature and developing markets in our companyoperated restaurants we further develop and refine operating standards marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced systemwide in addition we firmly believe that operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and essential to providing company personnel with restaurant operations experience 

we report results for companyoperated restaurants based on their sales less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs we report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues less associated occupancy costs for this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure we do not specifically allocate selling general  administrative expenses and other operating income expenses to companyoperated or franchised restaurants other operating items that relate to the companyoperated restaurants generally include gains on sales of restaurant businesses and writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements 

we believe the following information about companyoperated restaurants in our most significant markets provides an additional perspective on this business management responsible for our companyoperated restaurants in these markets analyzes the companyoperated business on this basis to assess its performance management of the company also considers this information when evaluating our restaurant ownership mix subject to other relevant considerations 

the following tables seek to illustrate the two components of our companyoperated margins the first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations which we refer to below as “store operating margin” the second relates to the value of our brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and royalties we refer to this component as “brandreal estate margin” both companyoperated and franchised restaurants are charged rent and royalties although rent and royalties for companyoperated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation rent and royalties for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales and the actual rent percentage varies depending on the level of mcdonald’s investment in the restaurant royalties may also vary by market 

as shown in the following tables in disaggregating the components of our companyoperated margins certain costs with respect to companyoperated restaurants are reflected in brandreal estate margin those costs consist of rent payable by mcdonald’s to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of occupancy  other operating expenses recorded in the consolidated statement of income store operating margins reflect rent and royalty expenses and those amounts are accounted for as income in calculating brandreal estate margin 

while we believe that the following information provides a perspective in evaluating our companyoperated business it is not intended as a measure of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating income or restaurant margins as reported by the company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us in particular as noted above we do not allocate selling general  administrative expenses to our companyoperated business an estimate of costs to support this business was made by the us and our three major markets in europe we believe on average that a range of 40000 to 50000 per restaurant is typical but the actual costs will vary depending on local circumstances and the organizational structure of the market these costs reflect the indirect services we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant 

  

  

  

  

 

selling general  administrative expenses 

consolidated selling general  administrative expenses increased 3 flat in constant currencies in 2007 and 8 7 in constant currencies in 2006 in 2007 higher employeerelated costs were offset by a reduction in costs due to the latam transaction in 2006 the increase was due to higher employeerelated costs including performancebased compensation expense 

 

  

 selling general  administrative expenses as a percent of revenues were 104 in 2007 compared with 110 in 2006 and 111 in 2005 and selling general  administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales were 37 in 2007 compared with 40 in both 2006 and 2005 management believes that analyzing selling general  administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales as well as revenues is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support systemwide restaurants

cash flows 

the company generates significant cash from operations and has substantial credit capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures dividends share repurchases and debt repayments 

cash provided by operations totaled 49 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by 29 billion in 2007 while cash provided by operations totaled 43 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by 26 billion in 2006 in 2007 cash provided by operations increased 535 million compared to 2006 primarily due to increased operating results and lower income tax payments in 2006 cash provided by operations was flat compared to 2005 due to increased operating results offset by changes in working capital primarily due to higher income tax payments 

cash used for investing activities totaled 12 billion in 2007 a decrease of 124 million compared to 2006 primarily due to net proceeds received from the latam transaction and the sale of boston market in 2007 partly offset by higher capital expenditures in 2007 cash used for investing activities totaled 13 billion in 2006 a decrease of 544 million compared to 2005 the increase in capital expenditures was more than offset by the proceeds from the disposition of chipotle as well as the sales of shortterm investments

capital expenditures increased 205 million or 12 in 2007 and 135 million or 8 in 2006 the increase in capital expenditures in 2007 was primarily due to increased investment in new restaurants primarily in europe and the us and the impact of foreign currency translation the increase in 2006 was primarily due to increased investment in existing restaurants primarily in the us capital expenditures in both years reflected 

  

the company’s focus on growing sales at existing restaurants including reinvestment initiatives such as reimaging in several markets around the world capital expenditures related to discontinued operations were 10 million 82 million and 110 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the expenditures in 2007 primarily related to investment in existing boston market restaurants and expenditures in 2006 and 2005 primarily related to new chipotle restaurants 

capital expenditures invested in major markets excluding japan represented approximately 75 of the total in 2007 and about 70 of the total in 2006 and 2005 japan is accounted for under the equity method and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts 

 

  

 new restaurant investments in all years were concentrated in markets with acceptable returns andor opportunities for longterm growth average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market these costs which include land buildings and equipment are managed through the use of optimally sized restaurants construction and design efficiencies and leveraging best practices in addition foreign currency fluctuations affect average development costs although the company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened in 2007 total development costs consisting of land buildings and equipment for new traditional mcdonald’s restaurants in the us averaged approximately 25 million 

the company owned approximately 45 of the land and about 70 of the buildings for its restaurants at yearend 2007 and 2006 

share repurchases and dividends

financial position and capital resources 

total assets and returns 

total assets increased by 417 million or 1 in 2007 changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased total assets by approximately 14 billion in 2007 this increase was partly offset by the sales of the latam businesses and boston market in 2007 about 70 of total assets were located in the consolidated major markets at yearend 2007 net property and equipment increased 15 billion in 2007 and represented about 70 of total assets at year end 

operating income which excludes interest income is used to compute return on average assets while income from continuing operations is used to calculate return on average common equity monthend balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity assets of discontinued operations are excluded from the average assets since operating income excludes results from discontinued operations 

 

 return on average assets has been negatively impacted by significantly higher cash and equivalents balances due in part to the company’s repatriation of earnings related to hia in 2005 cash and equivalents reduced return on average assets by 13 percentage points 21 percentage points and 12 percentage points in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

  

impairment and other charges credits net reducedincreased return on average assets by 54 percentage points 04 percentage points and 02 percentage points in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively in addition these items along with the 2007 and 2005 net tax benefit resulting from the completion of irs examinations and incremental tax expense in connection with hia reducedincreased return on average common equity by 85 percentage points 06 percentage points and 05 percentage points in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

in 2007 and 2006 return on average assets and return on average common equity both benefited from strong operating results in the us and europe as well as improved results in apmea during 2008 the company will continue to concentrate restaurant openings and new capital invested in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for longterm growth 

financing and market risk 

the company generally borrows on a longterm basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations debt obligations at december 31 2007 totaled 93 billion compared with 84 billion at december 31 2006 the net increase in 2007 was primarily due to net issuances of 573 million and the impact of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt of 342 million partly offset by statement of financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 133 noncash fair value adjustments of 23 million 

 

  

  

  

 fitch standard  poor’s and moody’s currently rate the company’s commercial paper f1 a1 and p2 respectively and its longterm debt a a and a3 respectively historically the company has not experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt the company’s key metrics for monitoring its credit structure are shown in the preceding table while the company targets these metrics for ease of focus it also considers similar credit ratios that incorporate capitalized operating leases to estimate total adjusted debt total adjusted debt a term that is commonly used by the rating agencies referred to above includes debt outstanding on the company’s balance sheet plus an adjustment to capitalize operating leases based on their most recent calculations these agencies add between 7 billion and 11 billion to debt for lease capitalization purposes which increases total debt as a percent of total capitalization and reduces cash provided by operations as a percent of total debt for credit rating purposes the company believes the rating agency methodology for capitalizing leases requires certain adjustments these adjustments include excluding percent rents in excess of minimum rents excluding certain companyoperated restaurant lease agreements outside the us that are cancelable with minimal penalties representing approximately 25 of companyoperated restaurant minimum rents outside the us based on the company’s estimate capitalizing nonrestaurant leases using a multiple of three times rent expense and reducing total rent expense by a percentage of the annual minimum rent payments due to the company from franchisees operating on leased sites based on this calculation for credit analysis purposes approximately 4 billion of future operating lease payments would be capitalized 

certain of the company’s debt obligations contain crossacceleration provisions and restrictions on company and subsidiary mortgages and the longterm debt of certain subsidiaries there are no provisions in the company’s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the company’s business the company has approximately 73 billion of authority to issue debt securities including debt securities registered on a us shelf registration statement and in connection with a euro mediumterm notes program the company also has 13 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement see debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements and authority to issue commercial paper in 2008 the company expects to issue commercial paper and longterm debt in order to refinance maturing debt and finance a portion of the company’s previously disclosed expectation to return 15 billion to 17 billion to shareholders debt maturing in 2008 includes approximately 18 billion of outstanding borrowings under the hia multicurrency term loan facility and 800 million of longterm corporate debt 

the company uses major capital markets bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense the company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring redeeming and repurchasing debt terminating exchange agreements and using derivatives the company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes all exchange agreements are overthecounter instruments 

in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations the company uses interest rate exchange agreements and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated derivatives were recorded at fair value in the company’s consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2007 and 2006 in miscellaneous other assets of 64 million and 41 million respectively and other longterm liabilities of 70 million and 117 million respectively see summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments for additional information regarding their use and the impact of sfas no 133 regarding derivatives 

  

the company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties intercompany financings and longterm investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates this reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders’ equity total foreign currencydenominated debt including the effects of foreign currency exchange agreements was 61 billion and 68 billion at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively in addition where practical the company’s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges 

the company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below or aggregate exposures exceed certain contractual limits at december 31 2007 and 2006 the company was required to post collateral of 55 million and 49 million respectively which was used to reduce the carrying value of the derivatives recorded in other longterm liabilities 

the company’s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies the company’s largest net asset exposures defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities at year end were as follows 

 

 the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the company’s results of operations cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments the interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10 in the same direction relative to the us dollar on all financial instruments however the analysis did not include the potential impact on sales levels local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the us based on the results of these analyses of the company’s financial instruments neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2007 levels nor a 10 adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2007 levels would materially affect the company’s results of operations cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions 

  

the company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

 

 property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straightline basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets taking into account anticipated technological or other changes the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors economic factors and industry trends if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense or writeoffs in future periods 

 

 the company has a sharebased compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equitybased incentives including stock options and restricted stock units rsus to employees and nonemployee directors the expense for these equitybased incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period 

the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closedform pricing model the pricing model requires assumptions such as the expected life of the stock option and expected volatility of the company’s stock over the expected life which significantly impact the assumed fair value the company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants sharebased compensation expense will fluctuate in future years the fair value of each rsu granted is equal to the market price of the company’s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period 

 

 longlived assets including goodwill are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in assessing the recoverability of the company’s longlived assets the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the company’s experience and knowledge of its operations these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions operating costs inflation competition and consumer and demographic trends a key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales if the company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future the company may be required to record impairment charges 

when the company sells an existing business to a developmental licensee it determines when these businesses are “held for sale” in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets  impairment charges on assets held for sale are recognized when management and if required the company’s board of directors have approved and committed to a plan to dispose of the assets the assets are available for disposal the disposal is probable of occurring within 12 months and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than the assets’ net book value among other factors an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the net book value of the business including foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity and the estimated cash sales price less costs of disposal 

an alternative accounting policy would be to recharacterize some or all of any loss as an intangible asset and amortize it to expense over future periods based on the term of the relevant licensing arrangement and as revenue is recognized for royalties and initial fees under this alternative for the latam transaction approximately 900 million of the 17 billion impairment charge could have been recharacterized as an intangible asset and amortized over the franchise term of 20 years resulting in about 45 million of expense annually this policy would be based on a view that the consideration for the sale consists of two components–the cash sales price and the future royalties and initial fees 

the company bases its accounting policy on management’s determination that royalties payable under its developmental license arrangements are substantially consistent with market rates for similar license arrangements the company does not believe it would be appropriate to recognize an asset for the right to receive marketbased fees in future periods particularly given the continuing support and services provided to the licensees therefore the company believes that the recognition of an impairment charge based on the net cash sales price reflects the substance of the sale transaction 

 

 from time to time the company is subject to proceedings lawsuits and other claims related to competitors customers employees franchisees government agencies intellectual property shareholders and suppliers the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses a determination of the amount of accrual required if any for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters the company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 

  

 the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies including the sale of appreciated assets in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if these estimates and assumptions change in the future the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance this could result in a charge to or an increase in income in the period such determination is made 

in addition the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter during 2007 the company recorded a 316 million benefit as a result of the completion of an irs examination of the company’s 20032004 us tax returns during 2005 the company recorded a 179 million benefit due to the completion of an irs examination of the company’s 20002002 us tax returns the company’s 20052006 us tax returns are under audit and the completion is expected in late 2008 or early 2009 

deferred us income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling 67 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures the temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the us if management’s intentions change in the future deferred taxes may need to be provided 

effects of changing prices  inflation 

the company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively this is because of rapid inventory turnover the ability to adjust menu prices cost controls and substantial property holdings many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation 

reconciliation of returns on incremental invested capital 

return on incremental invested capital roiic is a measure reviewed by management over oneyear and threeyear time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital this measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation the numerator is the company’s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period adjusted for the impact of the latam developmental license transaction in 2007 while the company has previously converted certain other markets to a developmental license structure management believes the latam transaction and the associated charge are not indicative of ongoing operations due to the size and scope of the transaction management believes that the adjusted operating results better reflect the underlying business trends relevant to the periods presented 

the denominator is the weightedaverage adjusted cash used for investing activities during the applicable one or threeyear period adjusted cash used for investing activities is defined as cash used for investing activities less cash generated from investing activities related to the boston market chipotle and latam transactions the weightedaverage adjusted cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis these weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter’s investing activities to incremental operating income for example fourth quarter 2007 investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income 125 of fourth quarter 2007 investing activities are included in the oneyear and threeyear calculations in contrast fourth quarter 2006 is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago and therefore have a full year impact on 2007 operating income with little or no impact to the base period 875 and 1000 of fourth quarter 2006 investing activities are included in the oneyear and threeyear calculations respectively management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average

 item 1a risk factors and cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements 

this report includes forwardlooking statements about our plans and future performance including those under outlook for 2007 these statements use such words as “may” “will” “expect” “believe” and “plan” they reflect our expectations and speak only as of the date of this report we do not undertake to update them our expectations or the underlying assumptions may change or not be realized and you should not rely unduly on forwardlooking statements 

our business and execution of our strategic plan the plan to win are subject to risks by far the most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our customers and a brand they trust meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our operating environment the informal eating out segment of the restaurant industry although largely mature in our major markets is also highly fragmented and competitive we have the added challenge of the cultural economic and regulatory differences that exist among the more than 100 countries where we operate we also face risk in adapting our business model in particular markets the decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise developmental license or joint venture agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex and changing our plan to reduce our ownership of restaurants may be difficult to achieve for many reasons and the change in ownership mix may not affect our results as we now expect regulatory and similar initiatives around the world have also become more wideranging and prescriptive and affect how we operate as well as our results in particular increasing focus on nutritional content and on the production processing and preparation of food “from field to front counter” presents challenges for our brand and may adversely affect our results 

these risks can have an impact both in the near and longterm and are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe are most likely to affect our performance 

our ability to remain a relevant and trusted brand and to increase sales depends largely on how well we execute the plan to win 

we developed the plan to win to address the key drivers of our business and results  people products place price and promotion the quality of our execution depends mainly on the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our results and financial condition are affected by our ownership mix and whether we can achieve a mix that optimizes margins and returns while meeting our business needs and customer expectations 

as described in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our plans call for a reduction in companyoperated restaurants by refranchising them or entering into developmental license agreements whether and when we can achieve these plans as well as their success is uncertain and will be affected by the following 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

 our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions which can adversely affect our sales margins and net income 

our results of operations are substantially affected not only by global economic conditions but also by local operating and economic conditions which can vary substantially by market unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market and may prompt promotional or other actions that adversely affect our margins constrain our operating flexibility or result in charges restaurant closings or sales of companyoperated restaurants whether we can manage this risk effectively depends mainly on the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 increasing regulatory complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways 

our legal and regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance litigation and similar risks that affect our operations and results in material ways in many of our markets including the united states and europe we are subject to increasing regulation which has significantly increased our cost of doing business in developing markets we face the risks associated with new and untested laws and judicial systems among the more important regulatory and litigation risks we face are the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

 the trading volatility and price of our common stock may be affected by many factors 

many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock these factors include some over which we have no control such as general market conditions and governmental actions or reports about economic activity that may have a marketmoving impact regardless of whether the action or activity directly relates to our business actions or reports by us authorities are of special import since the united states is our largest segment and our principal trading market trading activity in our common stock whether in the cash or derivative markets also affects prices and volatility in addition to reflecting investor expectations about our prospects trading activity can include significant purchases by shareholders who may seek to affect our business strategies as well as both sales and purchases resulting from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which mcdonald’s may be included such as the sp 500 index and the dow jones industrial average finally our stock price can be affected not only by operating actions we take but also by nonoperating initiatives such as our plans to reduce shares outstanding through repurchases or increases in our dividend rate 

our results can be adversely affected by disruptions or events such as the impact of severe weather conditions and natural disasters 

severe weather conditions such as hurricanes terrorist activities health epidemics or pandemics or the prospect of these events such as the potential spread of avian flu can have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels and in turn the mcdonald’s system and our results and prospects in the affected markets our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain for these purposes may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

description of the business 

the company primarily franchises and operates mcdonald’s restaurants in addition the company operates and has investments in certain nonmcdonald’s brands that are not material to the company’s overall results of the 31046 mcdonald’s restaurants in 118 countries at yearend 2006 18685 are operated by franchisees including 1091 operated by developmental licensees 4195 are operated by affiliates and 8166 are operated by the company under our conventional franchise arrangement franchisees provide a portion of the required capital by initially investing in the equipment signs seating and décor of their restaurant businesses and by reinvesting in the business over time the company owns the land and building or secures longterm leases for both companyoperated and franchised restaurant sites this ensures longterm occupancy rights helps control related costs and improves alignment with franchisees under our developmental license arrangement licensees provide ongoing capital for the entire business including the real estate interest while the company generally has no capital invested 

we view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and continually review our restaurant ownership mix that is our mix among companyoperated franchised  conventional or developmental license and joint venture to deliver a great customer experience and drive profitability in most cases franchising is the best way to achieve both goals although direct restaurant operation is more capitalintensive relative to franchising and results in lower operating margins as a percent of revenues companyoperated restaurants are important to our success in both mature and developing markets in our companyoperated restaurants and in collaboration with our franchisees we further develop and refine operating standards marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies so that we introduce systemwide only those that we believe are most beneficial in addition we firmly believe that owning restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor our companyoperated business also helps to facilitate changes in restaurant ownership as warranted by strategic considerations 

revenues consist of sales by companyoperated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates these fees primarily include rent service fees andor royalties that are based on a percent of sales with specified minimum rent payments fees vary by type of site amount of company investment and local business conditions these fees along with occupancy and operating rights are stipulated in franchiselicense agreements that generally have 20year terms 

the business is managed as distinct geographic segments united states europe asiapacific middle east and africa apmea latin america and canada in addition throughout this report we present a segment entitled “corporate  other” that includes corporate activities and nonmcdonald’s brands eg boston market the us and europe segments each account for approximately 35 of total revenues france germany and the united kingdom uk collectively account for approximately 60 of europe’s revenues and australia china and japan a 50owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method collectively account for nearly 50 of apmea’s revenues these six markets along with the us and canada are referred to as “major markets” throughout this report and comprise approximately 70 of total revenues 

during 2006 the company disposed of its entire investment in chipotle mexican grill chipotle via public stock offerings and a taxfree exchange for mcdonald’s common stock as a result of the complete disposition of chipotle the company has reflected chipotle’s results for all years shown as discontinued operations including gains from the disposition in 2006 

in analyzing business trends management considers a variety of performance and financial measures including comparable sales growth systemwide sales growth operating margins and returns 

 

  

  

  

   

strategic direction and financial performance 

the unique business relationship among the company its franchisees and suppliers collectively referred to as the system has been key to mcdonald’s success over the years this business model enables mcdonald’s to play an integral role in the communities we serve and consistently deliver relevant restaurant experiences to customers in addition our strategic alignment facilitates our ability to implement innovative ideas and profitably grow our business 

the company is focused on increasing mcdonald’s relevance to consumers through the execution of multiple initiatives under our plan to win in order to be better not just bigger this plan is designed to deliver operational excellence and leadership marketing leveraged around five key drivers of exceptional customer experiences  people products place price and promotion our longterm financial targets include average annual systemwide sales and revenue growth of 3 to 5 average annual operating income growth of 6 to 7 and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens these targets exclude the impact of foreign currency translation 

since implementing our plan to win we improved the taste of many of our menu items and have introduced a variety of new menu choices such as premium salads premium burgers and additional chicken offerings in many markets worldwide we appeal to a broad range of customer preferences using a locally relevant threetier menu strategy featuring premium salad and sandwich selections classic menu favorites and everyday affordable offerings we strive for continuous improvement in our training programs and restaurant execution through a comprehensive restaurant operations improvement process to enable and motivate franchisees and restaurant employees to improve the customer experience in addition our “i’m lovin’ it” global marketing theme continues to evolve to extend our marketing reach to consumers via print billboards and digital communications in addition to television advertising 

these efforts have increased our consumer relevance and delivered strong results in each of the last three years with revenue growth operating income growth and returns on incremental invested capital meeting or exceeding our longterm financial targets in addition we demonstrated our commitment to shareholders by returning 83 billion to shareholders through dividends paid and shares acquired from 2004 through 2006 

in 2006 the company’s increased relevance contributed to more customers visiting our restaurants helping drive global comparable sales up 57 and extending our consecutive monthly increases to 44 months through december 2006 

the momentum of our us business continued as a result of further strengthening our robust breakfast business and expanding our beverage salad and chicken offerings including the successful introductions of premium roast coffee the asian salad and the snack wrap initiatives such as reimaging restaurants extending operating hours and providing cashless payment options helped make mcdonald’s more inviting and convenient for customers 

in europe we built momentum using locally relevant menu offerings such as premium burgers and classic menu favorites as well as value platforms such as ein mal eins in germany and pound saver in the uk the markets provided predictable menu choice and variety through popular food promotions and engaged consumers with innovative marketing europe’s results were driven by strong performance in france germany and most other markets as well as significantly improved performance in the uk we also made progress improving consumer perceptions in europe including the uk by aggressively communicating mcdonald’s food quality nutrition and employment facts in addition to enhance local relevance by having local franchisees operate more restaurants and to improve returns we reduced our percentage of companyoperated restaurants in the uk from 63 at the end of 2005 to 54 at the end of 2006 we are encouraged by our momentum in europe and confident that our combined initiatives designed to enhance the customers’ experience will continue to drive growth over the long term 

in apmea systemwide sales and revenue growth were primarily driven by strong comparable sales in japan and australia and new restaurant expansion and positive comparable sales in china strategic menu pricing in japan and china contributed to this segment’s performance in 2006 we also entered into a strategic alliance with sinopec china’s largest petroleum retailer this agreement provides us the opportunity to codevelop drivethru restaurants at existing and new sinopec locations positioning us to capitalize on changing consumer lifestyles in china we believe that the longterm growth potential for our business in china is substantial and we are wellpositioned to capture the opportunity 

we continue to focus our management and financial resources on the core mcdonald’s business as the opportunities for growth remain significant accordingly during 2006 we disposed of our entire investment in chipotle via public stock offerings and an october taxfree exchange for mcdonald’s common stock these transactions provided the company with 329 million in cash proceeds and facilitated the acquisition of 186 million shares of mcdonald’s stock via the exchange 

in 2006 our strong global performance generated 43 billion of cash provided by operations about 17 billion of this cash was reinvested in our business primarily to remodel existing restaurants and build new ones we increased our annual dividend nearly 50 to 1 per share we also acquired 984 million shares through both shares repurchased and shares accepted in connection with the chipotle exchange in addition we paid down 23 billion of debt in 2006 reducing the 2005 increase related to the homeland investment act 

to improve local relevance profitability and returns we continually evaluate ownership structures in our markets the ownership mix in a given market depends on current and potential results the risks associated with operating in certain countries and legal and regulatory constraints 

as part of this evaluation in 2006 we established a target of having less than 30 companyoperated restaurants in each of our major consolidated markets and began working toward this goal specifically in the uk and canada for certain markets like china we believe owning and operating the restaurants is prudent until the legal environment in these countries becomes more conducive to franchising 

in addition to our franchising efforts discussed above we have identified markets with about 2300 restaurants collectively primarily companyoperated restaurants in latin america and apmea that we intend to transition to a developmental license structure under a developmental license a local entrepreneur owns the business including controlling the real estate and uses hisher capital and local knowledge to build the brand and optimize sales and profitability over the long term under this arrangement the company collects a royalty which varies by market based on a percent of sales but does not invest any capital during 2006 this royalty averaged about five percent of sales we have successfully used this structure for more than 15 years and currently have 36 countries that are solely operated by developmental licensees in addition to the financial benefits the company achieves when markets are developmentally licensed 

  

such as reduced capital spending improved returns and a stable stream of royalties this strategy allows the local owner to improve relevance and accelerate growth in the market and allows management to focus most of their time and energy on the markets that have the largest impact on results

 outlook for 2007 

the mcdonald’s system is energized by our current momentum we intend to build on this momentum by further enhancing every element of the brand experience and strengthening our connection with customers to capture the tremendous opportunities that lie ahead we will do this by continuing to execute our plan to win with a strategic focus on our customers and restaurants while continuing to exercise disciplined financial management 

we are confident that our plan to be better not just bigger supported by the alignment of our unique system of franchisees and suppliers will continue to drive enduring profitable growth our financial targets previously discussed focus management on those opportunities that best optimize shareholder value over the long term 

in 2007 we will continue to leverage our threetier menu approach featuring premium selections core menu favorites and everyday affordable offerings to appeal to a broad range of consumers we will complement this threetier strategy with permanent and limited time offerings of new products that enhance menu choice variety and value 

in the us our strategies focus on chicken breakfast beverages and convenience we are introducing snack wrap variations and the new southwest salad as well as additional breakfast offerings we will also enhance the drivethru experience by continuing to optimize the layout of restaurant interiors and exteriors 

in europe we will continue to attract customers with a variety of new food offerings such as premium chicken sandwiches and snack wraps while leveraging the strength of our everyday affordability platforms building greater brand trust will remain a priority in europe with ongoing aggressive communication efforts surrounding our food quality nutrition and employment image in addition we will focus on remodeling restaurants and improving operations to enhance local relevance and upgrade the customer experience 

in apmea where a large percentage of the population already eats breakfast away from home we are introducing or expanding breakfast as well as extending restaurant operating hours we will also continue to reinforce everyday value offerings and work on optimizing our menu pricing structure to enhance profitability 

we will continue to support consumers’ desire to make balanced lifestyle choices by educating them about our food’s nutritional value and encouraging greater physical activity we added nutrition labeling to the packaging of many of our branded core menu items in more than 25000 restaurants worldwide by the end of 2006 we will extend this effort to cover even more restaurants and products in 2007 we will also continue to play a leadership role in addressing children’s wellbeing as we pursue initiatives designed to positively affect children’s choice and activity this includes committing a large portion of our children’s marketing budget toward communications that encourage kids to be more active – physically and mentally 

we will also work to further enhance the customer experience by refining and executing our restaurant operations improvement process and expanding the use of our new point of sale software pos which was in approximately 8400 restaurants as of yearend 2006 tests indicate this new pos helps improve order accuracy and drivethru service speed in addition we will continue developing a new flexible operating system that takes a modular “plug and play” approach to kitchen configuration and restaurant operations in the future this system will enable greater menu flexibility based on local market needs while making it easier for crew to satisfy customers 

due to our expectations for continued strong results relatively stable capital expenditures over the next few years and the company’s intent on maintaining current debttocapital levels of 35 to 40 we believe that cash available for dividends and share repurchases will continue to grow we expect our share repurchase activity will continue to yield reductions in share count in the years ahead given our reduction in equity compensation and fewer stock options outstanding compared to prior years 

in 2007 we will continue to reduce the percentage of companyoperated restaurants in the uk and canada and we will continue to pursue the developmental license strategy described earlier 

the previously mentioned 2300 restaurants identified for potential conversion to developmental licensees represented nearly 3 billion in sales in 2006 but only generated 30 million in operating income after impairment and other charges to achieve these results we spent about 180 million in selling general  administrative expenses and invested more than 100 million in capital expenditures as appropriate we may license some of these markets as a group to a single developmental licensee these 2300 restaurants are about 75 companyoperated and represent about 3 billion in combined net investment which includes approximately 800 million in accumulated currency translation losses reflected in shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet 

our intent is to complete these transactions by the end of 2008 if we are able to complete these transactions we do not anticipate recovering either the 800 million in historical currency translation losses or most of the remaining 22 billion in net book value in the form of sales proceeds and therefore we expect that the loss in the aggregate would be significant we will continue impairment testing for these assets annually and as otherwise required by applicable accounting standards in particular our annual impairment testing for these assets is based on the assumption that these markets will continue to be operated under the existing ownership structure until it becomes probable that a transaction will occur within 12 months and we can reasonably estimate our sales proceeds the timing and amount of any loss for a particular transaction will depend on individual circumstances in 2006 we completed the transfer of 121 restaurants in four markets to developmental licensees and recorded pretax losses totaling 36 million related to this strategy

net income and diluted net income per common share 

in 2006 net income and diluted net income per common share were 35 billion and 283 during 2006 the company disposed of its entire investment in chipotle via public stock offerings and a taxfree exchange for mcdonald’s common stock and as a result has reflected chipotle’s results of operations and transaction gains as discontinued operations the 2006 results included 671 million of income or 053 per share related to discontinued operations income from continuing operations was 29 billion or 230 per share which included impairment and other charges of 134 million 98 million after tax or 007 per share as well as net incremental tax expense of 001 per share primarily related to a onetime impact from a tax law change in canada 

in 2005 net income and diluted net income per common share were 26 billion and 204 income from discontinued operations was 16 million or 001 per share while income from continuing operations was 26 billion or 203 per share the 2005 results from continuing operations included a net tax benefit of 73 million or 005 per share comprised of 179 million or 014 per share tax benefit due to a favorable audit settlement of the company’s 20002002 us tax returns and 106 million or 009 per share of incremental tax expense resulting from the decision to repatriate certain foreign earnings under the homeland investment act hia in addition 2005 included impairment and other charges credits net of 28 million pretax income 12 million after tax or 001 per share 

in 2004 net income and diluted net income per common share were 23 billion and 179 and income from continuing operations was also 23 billion or 179 per share the 2004 income from continuing operations included pretax operating charges of 151 million 99 million after tax or 008 per share related to a lease accounting correction and 130 million 116 million after tax or 009 per share related to impairment charges results also included pretax nonoperating income of 49 million 49 million after tax or 004 per share relating to the sale of the company’s interest in a us real estate partnership that resulted in the utilization of certain previously unrealized capital loss carryforwards 

refer to the impairment and other charges credits net and discontinued operations sections for further discussion 

in 2006 diluted weightedaverage shares outstanding decreased primarily due to treasury stock acquisitions exceeding stock option exercises in 2005 and 2006 the company acquired 984 million shares or 37 billion through both shares repurchased and shares accepted in connection with the chipotle exchange driving a reduction of about 5 of total shares outstanding compared with year–end 2005 

for 2005 diluted weightedaverage shares outstanding were relatively flat compared to 2004 shares outstanding at the beginning of 2005 were higher than the prior year due to stock options exercised exceeding treasury stock purchased during 2004 treasury stock purchased in 2005 offset this higher balance and the impact of options exercised during the year 

impact of foreign currency translation on reported results 

while changing foreign currencies affect reported results mcdonald’s mitigates exposures where practical by financing in local currencies hedging certain foreigndenominated cash flows and purchasing goods and services in local currencies 

in 2006 foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated revenues operating income and net income primarily due to the stronger euro canadian dollar and british pound consolidated revenues were positively impacted by the stronger brazilian real in 2005 revenues were positively impacted by the brazilian real and the canadian dollar but operating income and net income were minimally impacted by foreign currency translation in 2004 foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated revenues operating income and net income due to the strengthening of several major currencies primarily the euro 

 

  

   

revenues 

in both 2006 and 2005 consolidated revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales as well as stronger foreign currencies 

 

  

 in the us the increase in revenues in 2006 was primarily driven by our popular breakfast menu featuring premium roast coffee new products like our asian salad and snack wrap and a wide variety of premium chicken options as well as continued focus on everyday value and convenience in 2005 the increase in revenues was driven by multiple initiatives that delivered variety like the introduction of premium chicken sandwiches convenience such as cashless payment options and extended hours as well as our focus on value 

europe’s constant currency increase in revenues in 2006 was primarily due to strong comparable sales in france germany and russia which is entirely companyoperated in addition revenues in 2006 benefited from positive comparable sales in the uk which were offset by the impact of the market’s companyoperated restaurant closings and sales to franchisees and affiliates throughout the year in 2005 the increase in revenues was due to strong comparable sales in russia and positive comparable sales in france and germany partly offset by negative comparable sales in the uk 

in apmea the constant currency increase in revenues in 2006 was primarily driven by the consolidation of malaysia for financial reporting purposes due to an increase in the company’s ownership during the first quarter 2006 expansion and positive comparable sales in china as well as positive comparable sales in most markets the increase was partly offset by the 2005 conversion of the philippines and turkey about 325 restaurants to developmental licensee structures in 2005 revenues benefited from strong comparable sales in australia and taiwan and were negatively impacted by the philippines and turkey as mentioned above in addition revenues in 2005 benefited from expansion in china partly offset by that market’s negative comparable sales 

  

the following tables present systemwide sales growth rates and the increase in comparable sales for mcdonald’s restaurants 

 

  

 operating margins 

operating margin information and discussions relate to mcdonald’s restaurants only and exclude nonmcdonald’s brands 

 

 franchised margin dollars represent revenues from franchised and affiliated restaurants less the company’s occupancy costs rent and depreciation associated with those sites franchised margin dollars represented about 65 of the combined operating margins in 2006 2005 and 2004 franchised margin dollars increased 357 million or 9 8 in constant currencies in 2006 and 246 million or 6 as reported and in constant currencies in 2005 the us and europe segments accounted for more than 85 of the franchised margin dollars in all three years 

 

 the consolidated franchised margin percent increased in 2006 and 2005 due to strong comparable sales partly offset by higher rent expense in several markets 

 

 companyoperated margin dollars represent sales by companyoperated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants companyoperated margin dollars increased 398 million or 19 17 in constant currencies in 2006 and increased 96 million or 5 4 in constant currencies in 2005 the us and europe segments accounted for more than 70 of the companyoperated margin dollars in all three years 

 

 in the us the companyoperated margin percent increased in 2006 due to positive comparable sales partly offset by higher labor costs primarily due to a higher average hourly rate higher commodity costs including paper and higher utilities in 2005 the companyoperated margin percent benefited from positive comparable sales more than offset by higher commodity labor and occupancy costs 

europe’s companyoperated margin percent increased in 2006 primarily due to strong comparable sales partly offset by higher labor costs throughout the segment in addition initiatives in the uk such as the closing of certain underperforming restaurants in the first quarter and the sales of companyoperated restaurants to franchisees and affiliates throughout the year contributed to the increase in 2005 the companyoperated margin percent decreased due to higher labor costs and negative comparable sales in the uk partly offset by strong performance in russia in addition higher beef costs in 2005 had a negative impact across the segment 

in apmea the companyoperated margin percent in 2006 reflected improving results in china and many other markets in 2005 the companyoperated margin percent was negatively impacted by weak results in south korea partly offset by improvements in hong kong 

 

 we continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance profits and returns in most cases franchising is the best way to achieve these goals although direct 

  

restaurant operation is significantly more capitalintensive relative to franchising and results in lower operating margins as a percent of revenues companyoperated restaurants are important to our success in both mature and developing markets in our companyoperated restaurants we develop and refine operating standards marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies so that we introduce systemwide only those that we believe are most beneficial in addition we firmly believe that operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor 

we report results for companyoperated restaurants based on their sales less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs we report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues less associated occupancy costs for this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure we do not specifically allocate selling general  administrative expenses and other operating income expenses to companyoperated or franchised restaurants other operating items that relate to the companyoperated restaurants generally include gains on sales of restaurant businesses and writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements 

we believe the following information about companyoperated restaurants in our most significant markets will provide an additional perspective on this business management responsible for our companyoperated restaurants in these markets analyzes the companyoperated business on this basis to assess its performance management of the company also considers this information when evaluating our restaurant ownership mix subject to other relevant considerations 

the tables below seek to illustrate the two components of our companyoperated margins the first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations which we refer to below as “restaurant margin” the second relates to the value of our brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and service fees we refer to this component as “brandreal estate margin” both companyoperated and franchised restaurants are charged rent and service fees although rent and service fees for companyoperated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation rent and service fees for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales and the actual percentage attributable to rent varies depending on the level of mcdonald’s investment in the restaurant service fees may also vary by market 

as shown below in disaggregating the components of our companyoperated margins certain costs with respect to companyoperated restaurants would be reflected in brandreal estate margin those costs consist of rent payable by mcdonald’s to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of occupancy  other operating expenses recorded in the consolidated statement of income restaurant margin would reflect rent and service fees paid and those fees would be accounted for as income in calculating brandreal estate margin 

while we believe that the following information provides a perspective in evaluating our companyoperated business it is not intended as a measure of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating income or operating margins as reported by the company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us in particular as noted above we do not allocate selling general  administrative expenses to our companyoperated business an estimate of costs to support this business was made by the us canada and our three major markets in europe we believe on average that a range of 40000 to 50000 per restaurant is typical but the actual costs will vary by restaurant depending on local circumstances and the organizational structure of the market these costs reflect the indirect services we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant

consolidated selling general  administrative expenses increased 8 in 2006 and 12 in 2005 7 and 11 in constant currencies in 2006 the increase was due to higher employeerelated costs including performancebased compensation expense sharebased compensation expense due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 123r sharebased payment sfas no 123r accounted for a majority of the constant currency increase in 2005 

 

  

  

 selling general  administrative expenses as a percent of revenues were 108 in 2006 compared with 109 in 2005 and 104 in 2004 and selling general  administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales were 41 in 2006 compared with 40 in 2005 and 38 in 2004 on a pro forma basis sharebased compensation expense would increase these ratios 13 and 05 percentage points respectively for 2004 management believes that analyzing selling general  administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales as well as revenues is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support systemwide restaurants 

impairment and other charges credits net 

on a pretax basis the company recorded impairment and other charges credits net of 134 million in 2006 28 million in 2005 and 281 million in 2004 associated with impairment as well as certain strategic actions in 2006 and a lease accounting correction in 2004 mcdonald’s management does not include these items when reviewing business performance trends because we do not believe these items are indicative of expected ongoing results 

 

  

   

in 2006 the company recorded 134 million of pretax impairment charges primarily related to the following items losses incurred on the transfers of the company’s ownership interest in certain markets to developmental licensees 36 million the closing of certain restaurants in the uk in conjunction with an overall restaurant portfolio review 35 million costs to buy out certain litigating franchisees in brazil 29 million asset writeoffs and other charges in apmea 18 million and a loss related to the decision to dispose of supply chain operations in russia 13 million 

in 2005 the company recorded 23 million of pretax impairment charges primarily in south korea in addition the company recorded 51 million of pretax income primarily due to the transfer of the company’s ownership interest in turkey to a developmental licensee and a favorable adjustment to certain liabilities established in prior years due to lower than originally anticipated employeerelated and lease termination costs 

in 2004 the company recorded 130 million of pretax impairment charges primarily in south korea in addition like other companies in the restaurant and retail industries the company reviewed its accounting practices and policies with respect to leasing transactions following this review and in consultation with its external auditors the company corrected an error in the amount of 151 million pretax in its prior practices to conform the lease term used in calculating straightline rent expense with the term used to amortize improvements on leased property the result of the correction primarily accelerated the recognition of rent expense under certain leases that include fixedrent escalations by revising the computation of straightline rent expense to include these escalations for certain option periods as the correction related solely to accounting treatment it did not affect mcdonald’s historical or future cash flows or the timing of payments under the related leases its effect on the company’s net income per share cash provided by operations and shareholders’ equity was immaterial these adjustments primarily impacted the us china and boston market other markets were less significantly impacted as many of the leases outside of the us do not contain fixedrent escalations 

other operating expense net

 nm not meaningful 

 

 when comparing 2005 to 2004 the following discussion of operating income relates to the pro forma increasedecrease excluding currency translation in the table above 

in 2006 and 2005 us operating income included higher combined operating margin dollars compared to 2005 and 2004 respectively in 2004 operating income included charges related to the lease accounting correction of 70 million impairment charges of 10 million and higher asset dispositions compared to 2005 

in europe results for 2006 reflected strong performance in france and a gain on the sale of an office building in russia partly offset by impairment and other charges in addition 2006 operating results in the uk and germany contributed to the increase in operating income in 2005 results reflected strong performance in france and russia improved performance in germany and weak results in the uk in addition results in 2005 included a supply chain charge of 24 million 

in apmea results for 2006 were driven by strong performance in australia as well as improved results in china and japan partly offset by impairment and other charges results for 2005 were positively impacted by strong performance in australia partly offset by weak results in japan china and south korea in addition lower impairment and other charges in 2005 compared to 2004 benefited the growth rate 

in latin america results for 2006 and 2005 reflected continued strong sales performance across most markets in addition 2006 results included 31 million of impairment and other charges primarily due to the buy out of certain litigating franchisees in brazil in 2005 results reflected lower asset dispositions and other expense compared to 2004

interest expense 

interest expense for 2006 increased primarily due to higher average debt levels as a result of activity related to hia funded by local borrowings in late 2005 and higher average interest rates in late fourth quarter 2005 the company repatriated approximately 3 billion of certain foreign historical earnings under hia which had a minimal impact on the average debt levels for 2005 interest expense for 2005 reflected higher average interest rates and lower average debt levels compared with 2004 

nonoperating income expense net 

 

   

interest income consists primarily of interest earned on shortterm cash investments translation losses primarily relate to the net gains or losses on certain hedges that reduce the exposure to variability on certain intercompany foreign cash flow streams other expense primarily consists of gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt amortization of deferred debt issuance costs and minority interest 

interest income increases for 2006 and 2005 were primarily due to higher cash levels 

provision for income taxes 

in 2006 2005 and 2004 the reported effective income tax rates were 310 296 and 288 respectively the 2006 effective tax rate was negatively impacted by a tax law change in canada in 2005 the effective tax rate included a benefit of 179 million due to a favorable audit settlement of the company’s 20002002 us tax returns partly offset by approximately 106 million of expense related to the company’s decision to take advantage of the onetime opportunity provided under hia the effective income tax rate for 2004 benefited from an international transaction and the utilization of certain previously unrealized capital loss carryforwards

cash flows 

the company generates significant cash provided by operations and has substantial credit capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures dividends share repurchases and debt repayments 

cash provided by operations totaled 43 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by 26 billion in 2006 while cash provided by operations totaled 43 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by 27 billion in 2005 in 2006 cash provided by operations was flat compared to 2005 due to increased operating results offset by changes in working capital primarily due to higher 2006 income tax payments in 2005 cash provided by operations increased 433 million compared to 2004 due to strong operating results primarily in the us and changes in working capital the changes in working capital in 2005 benefited from lower income tax payments compared with the prior year 

cash used for investing activities totaled 13 billion in 2006 a decrease of 544 million compared to 2005 the increase in capital expenditures was more than offset by the proceeds from the disposition of chipotle as well as the sales of shortterm investments cash used for investing activities totaled 18 billion in 2005 an increase of 435 million compared with 2004 primarily due to higher capital expenditures and increased purchases of restaurant businesses 

cash used for financing activities totaled 52 billion in 2006 compared to cash provided by financing activities of 362 million in 2005 the 2006 activity was due to higher shares repurchased higher net debt repayments and an increase in the common stock dividend in 2005 cash provided by financing activities increased 20 billion primarily due to 29 billion of local borrowings related to hia and higher proceeds from employee stock option exercises the increase was partly offset by higher shares repurchased higher debt repayments and an increase in the common stock dividend compared to 2004 

as a result of the above activity the company’s cash and equivalents balance decreased 21 billion in 2006 to 21 billion compared to an increase of 29 billion in 2005

approximately 60 of companyoperated restaurants and about 85 of franchised and affiliated restaurants were located in the major markets at the end of 2006 franchisees and affiliates operated about 75 of mcdonald’s restaurants at yearend 2006 boston market restaurants are companyoperated 

capital expenditures increased 135 million or 8 in 2006 and 188 million or 13 in 2005 the increase in capital expenditures in both years was primarily due to increased investment in existing restaurants primarily in the us capital expenditures in both years reflects the company’s focus on growing sales at existing restaurants including reinvestment initiatives such as reimaging in several markets around the world capital expenditures related to discontinued operations were 63 million 84 million and 98 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively and primarily related to new chipotle restaurants 

capital expenditures invested in major markets excluding japan represented about 70 of the total in 2006 2005 and 2004 japan is accounted for under the equity method and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts 

 

  

 new restaurant investments in both 2006 and 2005 were concentrated in markets with acceptable returns andor opportunities for longterm growth average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market these costs which include land buildings and equipment are managed through the use of optimally sized restaurants construction and design efficiencies and leveraging best practices in addition foreign currency fluctuations affect average development costs although the company is not responsible for all costs on every restaurant opened in 2006 total development costs consisting of land buildings and equipment for new traditional mcdonald’s restaurants averaged approximately 22 million in the us and approximately 

  

19 million in the nine markets where development was concentrated outside the us for 2007 the us china and eight other consolidated markets are expected to open more than 500 restaurants

financial position and capital resources 

total assets and returns 

total assets decreased by 10 billion or 3 in 2006 changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased total assets by approximately 13 billion in 2006 which was more than offset by a decrease in cash and the disposition of chipotle more than 65 of total assets were located in the consolidated major markets at yearend 2006 net property and equipment increased 13 billion in 2006 and represented about 70 of total assets at year end total assets at december 31 2005 included 29 billion of cash borrowed under hia due to the repatriation of certain foreign earnings 

operating income which excludes interest income is used to compute return on average assets while income from continuing operations is used to calculate return on average common equity monthend balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity assets of discontinued operations are excluded from the average assets since operating income excludes results from discontinued operations 

 

  

 impairment and other charges credits net reducedincreased return on average assets by 04 percentage points 02 percentage points and 09 percentage points in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively in addition these items along with the 2005 net tax benefit due to a favorable audit settlement and incremental tax expense in connection with hia and the 2004 nonoperating gain on the sale of a us real estate partnership reducedincreased return on average common equity by 06 percentage points 06 percentage points and 13 percentage points in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

in 2006 and 2005 return on average assets and return on average common equity both benefited from strong operating results in the us in addition returns in 2006 benefited from improved results in europe during 2007 the company will continue to concentrate mcdonald’s restaurant openings and new capital invested in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for longterm growth 

financing and market risk 

the company generally borrows on a longterm basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations debt obligations at december 31 2006 totaled 84 billion compared with 101 billion at december 31 2005 the net decrease in 2006 was primarily due to net repayments 23 billion and statement of financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 133 noncash fair value adjustments 82 million partly offset by the impact of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt 605 million 

 

  

  

  

   

  

 moody’s standard  poor’s and fitch currently rate the company’s commercial paper p1 a1 and f1 respectively and its longterm debt a2 a and a respectively historically the company has not experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt the company’s key metrics for monitoring its credit structure are shown in the preceding table while the company targets these metrics for ease of focus it also looks at similar credit ratios that incorporate capitalized operating leases to estimate total adjusted debt total adjusted debt is a term that is commonly used by the rating agencies referred to above which includes debt outstanding on the company’s balance sheet plus an adjustment to capitalize operating leases based on their most recent calculations these agencies add between 7 billion and 11 billion of debt for lease capitalization purposes the company believes the rating agency methodology for capitalizing leases requires certain adjustments these adjustments include excluding percent rents in excess of minimum rents excluding certain companyoperated restaurant lease agreements outside the us that are cancelable with minimal penalties representing approximately 25 of companyoperated restaurant minimum rents outside the us based on the company’s estimate capitalizing nonrestaurant leases using a multiple of three times rent expense and reducing total rent expense by a percentage of the annual minimum rent payments due to the company from franchisees operating on leased sites based on this calculation for credit analysis purposes approximately 4 billion to 5 billion of future operating lease payments would be capitalized 

certain of the company’s debt obligations contain crossacceleration provisions and restrictions on company and subsidiary mortgages and the longterm debt of certain subsidiaries there are no provisions in the company’s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the company’s business the company has 13 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement see debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements as well as a us shelf registration of debt securities and a euro mediumterm notes program that each have approximately 29 billion of company authority remaining for future debt issuances 

the company uses major capital markets bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense the company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring redeeming and repurchasing debt terminating exchange agreements and using derivatives the company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes all exchange agreements are overthecounter instruments 

in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations the company uses interest rate exchange agreements and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated all derivatives were recorded at fair value in the company’s consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2006 and 2005 primarily in miscellaneous other assets 41 million and 83 million respectively and other longterm liabilities 166 million and 103 million respectively see summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments for additional information regarding their use and the impact of sfas no 133 regarding derivatives 

the company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties intercompany financings and longterm investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates in 2006 and 2005 the company used foreign currency debt to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated cash and equivalents related to hia this reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders’ equity total foreign currencydenominated debt including the effects of foreign currency exchange agreements was 68 billion and 81 billion for the years ended 2006 and 2005 respectively in addition where practical the company’s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges 

the company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below or aggregate exposures exceed certain contractual limits at december 31 2006 and 2005 the company was required to post collateral of 49 million and 24 million respectively 

the company’s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies the company’s largest net asset exposures defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities at year end were as follows 

 

 the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the company’s results of operations cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments the interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10 in the same direction relative to the us dollar on all financial instruments however the analysis did not include the potential impact on sales levels local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the us based on the results of these analyses of the company’s financial instruments neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2006 levels nor a 10 adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2006 levels would materially affect the company’s results of operations cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments

in addition to longterm obligations the company had guaranteed certain affiliate and other loans totaling 12 million at december 31 2006 

other matters 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions 

the company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

 

 property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straightline basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets taking into account anticipated technological or other changes the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors economic factors and industry trends if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense or writeoffs in future periods 

 

 the company has sharebased compensation plans which authorize the granting of various equitybased incentives including stock options and rsus to employees and non employee directors the expense for these equitybased incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and amortized over their vesting period 

the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closedform pricing model the pricing model requires assumptions such as the expected life of the stock option and expected volatility of the company’s stock over the expected life which significantly impact the assumed fair value the company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants sharebased compensation expense will fluctuate in future years the fair value of each rsu granted is equal to the market price of the company’s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period 

 

 longlived assets including goodwill are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in assessing the recoverability of the company’s longlived assets the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the company’s experience and knowledge of its operations these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions operating costs inflation competition and consumer and demographic trends the biggest assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales if the company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future the company may be required to record impairment charges 

  

 from time to time the company is subject to proceedings lawsuits and other claims related to competitors customers employees franchisees government agencies intellectual property shareholders and suppliers the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses a determination of the amount of accrual required if any for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters the company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 

 

 the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if these estimates and assumptions change in the future the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance this could result in a charge to or an increase in income in the period such determination is made 

in addition the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter during 2005 the company recorded a 179 million benefit due to favorable audit settlement of the company’s 2000–2002 us tax returns the company’s 20032004 us tax returns are under audit and are expected to be settled in 2007 

deferred us income taxes have not been recorded for basis differences totaling 5 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures the basis differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the us if management’s intentions change in the future deferred taxes may need to be provided 

effects of changing prices  inflation 

the company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively this is because of rapid inventory turnover the ability to adjust menu prices cost controls and substantial property holdings many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation 

reconciliation of returns on incremental invested capital 

return on incremental invested capital roiic is a measure reviewed by management over oneyear and threeyear time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital this measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation the numerator is the company’s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period the denominator is the weightedaverage adjusted cash used for investing activities during the applicable one or threeyear period 

adjusted cash used for investing activities is defined as cash used for investing activities adjusted for cash generated from used for investing activities related to chipotle the weightedaverage adjusted cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis these weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter’s investing activities to incremental operating income for example fourth quarter 2006 cash used for investing activities is weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income 125 of fourth quarter 2006 cash used for investing activities is included in the oneyear and threeyear calculations in contrast fourth quarter 2005 cash used for investing activities is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago and therefore have a full year impact on 2006 operating income with little or no impact to the base period 875 and 1000 of fourth quarter 2005 cash used for investing activities is included in the oneyear and threeyear calculations respectively management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

this report includes forwardlooking statements about our plans and future performance including those under outlook for 2006 in management’s discussion and analysis these statements use such words as “may” “will” “expect” “believe” and “plan” they reflect our expectations about the future and speak only as of the date of this report we do not undertake to update or revise them our expectations or the underlying assumptions may change or not be realized and you should not place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements 

  

our business and execution of our strategic plan the plan to win are subject to risks by far the most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our customers and a brand they trust meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our operating environment the informal eating out segment of the restaurant industry although largely mature in our major markets is also highly fragmented and competitive we have the added challenge of the cultural economic and regulatory differences that exist among the more than 100 countries where we operate we also face risk in adapting our business model in particular markets the decision to own restaurants or to operate under conventional franchise license or joint venture agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex and changing our plan as described below to reduce our ownership of restaurants may be difficult to achieve for many reasons and the change in ownership mix may not affect our results as we now expect regulatory and similar initiatives around the world have also become more wideranging and prescriptive and affect how we operate as well as our results in particular the increasing focus on nutrition presents challenges for our menu development and marketing plans and may adversely affect our sales and costs of doing business 

  

these risks can have an impact both in the near and longterm and are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe are most likely to affect our performance 

  

our ability to remain a relevant and trusted brand and to increase sales depends largely on how well we have designed and execute against the plan to win 

  

we developed the plan to win to address the key drivers of our business and results—people products place price and promotion the quality of our execution depends mainly on the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

    

   

   

   

our results and financial condition are affected by our ownership mix and whether we can achieve a mix that optimizes margins and returns while meeting our business needs and customer expectations 

  

our plans call for a reduction in companyoperated restaurants in the uk by refranchising them to third parties as well as the pursuit of a developmental license model in between 15 to 20 additional markets and organizational changes to improve the performance of companyoperated restaurants in other markets notably canada whether and when we can achieve these plans as well as their success is uncertain and depends mainly on the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions which can adversely affect our sales margins and net income 

  

our results of operations are substantially affected not only by global economic conditions but also by local operating and economic conditions which can vary substantially by market unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market and may prompt promotional or other actions that adversely affect our margins constrain our operating flexibility or result in charges restaurant closings or sales of companyoperated restaurants whether we can manage this risk effectively depends mainly on the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

increasing regulatory complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways 

  

our legal and regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance litigation and similar risks that affect our operations and results in material ways in many of our markets including the united states and europe we are subject to increasing regulation which has significantly increased our cost of doing business in developing markets we face the risks associated with new and untested laws and judicial systems among the more important regulatory and litigation risks we face are the following 

  

   

    

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our results can be adversely affected by market disruptions or events such as the impact of weather conditions and natural disasters 

  

market disruptions due to severe weather conditions terrorist activities health epidemics or pandemics or the prospect of these events such as recent reports about the potential spread of avian flu can affect consumer spending and confidence levels and adversely affect our results or prospects in affected markets our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain for these purposes may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully

overview 

  

description of the business 

  

the company primarily franchises and operates mcdonald’s restaurants in addition the company operates certain nonmcdonald’s brands that are not material to the company’s overall results of the more than 30000 mcdonald’s restaurants in over 100 countries over 8000 are operated by the company more than 18000 are operated by franchiseeslicensees and over 4000 are operated by affiliates under our conventional franchise arrangement franchisees provide a portion of the required capital by initially investing in the equipment signs seating and décor of their restaurant businesses and by reinvesting in the business over time the company owns the land and building or secures longterm leases for both companyoperated and franchised restaurant sites this ensures longterm occupancy rights helps control related costs and improves alignment with franchisees under our developmental license arrangement licensees provide capital for 100 of the business including the real estate interest while the company generally has no capital invested 

  

while we view ourselves primarily as a franchisor we continually review our restaurant ownership mix that is our mix between companyoperated conventional franchise joint venture or developmental license to deliver a great customer experience and drive profitability with a focus on underperforming markets and markets where direct restaurant operation by us is unattractive due to market size business conditions or legal considerations although direct restaurant operation is more capitalintensive relative to franchising and results in lower operating margins as a percent of revenues companyoperated restaurants are important to our success in both mature and developing markets in our companyoperated restaurants along with our franchisees we can develop and refine operating standards marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies so that we introduce systemwide only those that we believe are most beneficial in addition we firmly believe that owning restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor our companyoperated business also helps to facilitate changes in restaurant ownership as warranted by strategic considerations the financial health of franchisees or other factors 

  

revenues consist of sales by companyoperated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates these fees primarily include rent service fees andor royalties that are based on a percent of sales with specified minimum rent payments fees vary by type of site amount of company investment and local business conditions these fees along with occupancy and operating rights are stipulated in franchiselicense agreements that generally have 20year terms 

  

the business is managed as distinct geographic segments united states europe asiapacific middle east and africa apmea latin america and canada in addition throughout this report we present a segment entitled “other” that includes nonmcdonald’s brands eg boston market and chipotle mexican grill chipotle the us and europe segments each account for approximately 35 of total revenues france germany and the united kingdom collectively account for over 60 of europe’s revenues australia china and japan a 50owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method collectively account for nearly 50 of apmea’s revenues and brazil accounts for over 40 of latin america’s revenues these seven markets along with the us and canada are referred to as “major markets” throughout this report and comprise approximately 70 of total revenues 

  

in analyzing business trends management considers a variety of performance and financial measures including comparable sales growth systemwide sales growth operating margins and returns 

  

   

   

   

    

   

strategic direction and financial performance 

  

the company’s 50 years of success has been driven by the strength of mcdonald’s global brand and our unique business relationship among franchisees suppliers and the company collectively referred to as the system this business model is key to our success fostering our ability to be locally relevant a competitor in the marketplace and a contributor to our communities this strategic alignment enables the system to pursue innovative ideas that satisfy our customers and profitably grow our business 

  

in 2003 the company initiated a comprehensive revitalization plan focused on maximizing customer satisfaction and strengthening our financial position we redefined our strategy to emphasize growth through adding more customers to existing restaurants and aligned the system around our customerfocused plan to win a combination of customercentric initiatives designed to deliver operational excellence and leadership marketing were implemented around five drivers of exceptional customer experiences—people products place price and promotion 

  

in 2004 we substantially achieved our nearterm goals by executing our strategy we improved the taste of many of our core menu offerings and introduced a variety of menu choices that were well received by customers such as new salad lines breakfast and chicken offerings we offered a variety of price points to appeal to a broad spectrum of customers we streamlined processes such as new product development and restaurant operations improved our training programs and implemented performance measures including a restaurant review and measurement process to enable and motivate franchisees and restaurant employees to serve customers better we also launched the “i’m lovin’ it” marketing theme which achieved high levels of customer awareness worldwide 

  

throughout 2005 we remained aligned and focused on executing the plan to win using our customercentric philosophy as our guide our 2005 performance reflected our continuously evolving customer relevance and powerful brand strength that culminated with december 2005 marking our 32nd consecutive month of positive global comparable sales in the us our strong sales momentum continued as increased customer demand for our core and premium products breakfast menu and more convenient hours fueled growth on top of strong prior year comparisons in europe we focused on gaining traction and building momentum across the entire segment we had success in france and russia and we gained traction in germany where customers responded favorably to our ein mal eins “one by one” value platform and premium products like salads plus the uk remained a challenging marketplace and our efforts to gain traction in this market will take time we are encouraged by our progress in europe and confident that our focus on enhancing customers’ experience through menu marketing and value initiatives will generate improvements over time 

  

over the past three years in line with our commitment to revitalize the brand we have exercised greater financial discipline we delivered against the targets laid out in our revitalization plan and achieved many significant milestones today our resulting financial strength and substantial cash generating ability is a testament to system alignment and focus on growing our existing restaurant business our progress has created the opportunity to return even greater amounts of cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases after funding investments in our business that offer solid returns in 2005 we increased the dividend to 67 per share a 185 increase from the 2002 dividend and we repurchased over 22 billion of common stock since the beginning of 2003 to enhance shareholder value 

  

highlights from the year included 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

 on january 1 2005 the company early adopted the statement of financial accounting standards no123r sharebased payment sfas no123r this new accounting standard requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values the company adopted this accounting treatment prospectively in connection with the adoption the company adjusted the mix of employee longterm incentivebased compensation by reducing stock options awarded and increasing certain cashbased compensation primarily annual incentivebased compensation and other equitybased awards sharebased compensation was included as a pro forma disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for years prior to the adoption in 2005 sharebased and related compensation expense was 010 per share the pro forma sharebased compensation for 2004 and 2003 was 011 per share and 017 per share respectively 

  

during 2005 the company repatriated approximately 3 billion of foreign historical earnings under the homeland investment act hia a majority of the repatriation was funded through local borrowings in certain markets which totaled 29 billion this resulted in an increase in cash and debt on our consolidated balance sheet at year end which is expected to be temporary and does not signal any change in our financial and capital discipline the repatriated cash will primarily be used to fund capital expenditures under our remodeling initiative new restaurant openings and salaries in the us apart from hiarelated activity the company paid down over 12 billion of debt during 2005 

  

outlook for 2006 

  

the company’s longterm goal is to create a differentiated customer experience—one that builds brand loyalty and delivers long term profitable growth for all shareholders and the system our long term goals remain unchanged average annual systemwide sales and revenue growth of 3 to 5 average annual operating income growth of 6 to 7 and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens these goals exclude the impact of foreign currency translation 

  

our guiding customercentric framework the plan to win remains solidly in place we plan to create more relevant and deeper connections with our customers by capturing significant opportunities within the five fundamental drivers of our plan—people products place price and promotion the initiatives around each “p” continuously evolve to maximize customer relevance and system profitability we are confident that our plan supported by our unique system of franchisees and suppliers and our collective alignment will continue to drive long term profitable growth and enhance shareholder value 

  

in 2006 we remain committed to offering quality products that satisfy our customers’ demands for choice and variety promoting the importance of physical activity and providing nutritional information on our food packaging we will continue to introduce locally relevant new products that complement our core menu and provide customers with more reasons to visit more often in the us we will extend the variety of our salad and chicken lines with the introduction of an asian chicken salad and we expect to strengthen our share of the growing chicken sandwich market with our premium spicy chicken sandwich in europe we are continuing our focus on our everyday value menus such as ein mal eins and pound saver along with premium offerings including salads and sandwiches such as the big tasty in asia where rice is a daily staple we successfully introduced an innovative rice burger in 2005 in taiwan—kalubi beef or spicy chicken served on a lightly toasted rice patty—and have plans to extend this concept to other asian markets in 2006 

  

delivering value through a variety of menu price points that appeal to our broad range of customers has long been part of our history a strong balance of core menu favorites premium products and everyday value ensures that we can appeal to most people in europe and elsewhere we continue to combine everyday value with a strong tradeup strategy to remain relevant to today’s customer and drive profitability 

  

we also plan to capitalize on opportunities to improve the customer experience in our restaurants through improved service and ambiance we continue to implement people training programs to enhance the overall service experience and we will extend our restaurant operation improvement process roip measurement of restaurant execution to even more markets this year our remodeling efforts will continue around the globe in 2006 2500 restaurants worldwide are expected to be remodeled utilizing innovative modern designs we will continue to enhance customer convenience by extending operating hours accepting debit credit and gift cards enabling wireless internet access and adding double drive thru lanes in select restaurants 

  

we believe providing information on nutrition and promoting physical activity support our customers’ needs to make the best choices for their lifestyles starting in 2006 we will provide nutrition information on the majority of our food packaging using an easy to understand icon and bar chart format we plan to implement the new packaging in more than 20000 restaurants by the end of the year we are the first quickservice restaurant to do this guided by customer input and independent experts from around the world 

  

in connection with executing the plan to win to improve local relevance profitability and returns we continually evaluate ownership structures in our markets to identify potential operational and growth opportunities the ownership mix in a given market depends on our plans for the market local operating conditions restaurantlevel results in the market and legal and regulatory constraints in the united states france germany and australia for example we believe that our current ownership mix is appropriate in light of current operating results by contrast we plan to refranchise at least 50 companyoperated restaurants in the uk in 2006 and 

  

 we expect that the percentage of companyoperated restaurants in that market will continue to decline from its current 63 in canada we plan to review our companyoperated restaurants and determine the most appropriate ownership mix and organize personnel around a revised structure for the business in countries where franchising is not yet a well established business model such as china or russia we will continue to own and operate our restaurants 

  

we have also recently identified between 15 and 20 markets where we will pursue converting our existing ownership to a developmental licensee structure over the next three years under this structure which the company successfully employs in 32 countries outside the us approximately 800 restaurants the licensees own the business including the real estate interest and use their local knowledge and their capital to build the brand and optimize sales and profitability over the longterm included in these 32 countries were two additional markets 325 restaurants that became developmental licensees in 2005 and work on this change of ownership began a couple of years ago while the company generally has no capital invested in this type of market it does receive a royalty based on a percent of sales the royalty rate varies by market and is based on growth and profitability opportunity within the market 

  

our plans to change our ownership mix through conventional refranchising and increased use of developmental licenses will affect our results the results of companyoperated restaurants are recorded in our consolidated financial statements and we are responsible for their ongoing capital investments whereas restaurants operated under franchise or license agreements generate revenue streams without a comparable level of capital investment by us we do not expect that the financial impact of our plans to adjust our ownership mix will be material in 2006 given the time required to execute these plans 

  

our plans to convert markets to a developmental license structure depend on our ability to identify prospective licensees with the experience and financial resources to be effective operators of mcdonald’s restaurants we are in the process of identifying potential licensees in some of these markets but we cannot predict how quickly we will complete transactions the markets that we have targeted as candidates for developmental licenses had in the aggregate about 1500 restaurants predominately companyoperated and in 2005 had 15 billion in sales 50 million in capital expenditures 100 million in selling general  administrative expenses and generated a modest operating loss 

  

at december 31 2005 the company’s net investment in these markets was about 16 billion as a result of our annual testing we recorded impairment charges for some of these markets in the last three years for others current cash flows or undiscounted projected cash flows are such that no impairment charges were required in each case our impairment testing was based on the assumption that these markets will continue to be operated under the existing ownership structure we will continue our annual impairment testing for these assets based on this assumption until it becomes probable that a transaction will occur within 12 months and we can reasonably estimate our sales proceeds we may not recover our entire net investment in each of these markets and may therefore record losses in future periods as we adjust our ownership mix the timing and amount of any losses will depend on the circumstances of each transaction currently we do not believe that any significant transactions are likely to be completed within 12 months 

  

while the company does not provide specific guidance on earnings per share the following information is provided to assist in analyzing the company’s results 

  

   

   

   

   

   

    

   

   

   

   

consolidated operating results 

  

operating results 

  

   

   

   

 net income and diluted net income per common share 

  

in 2005 net income and diluted net income per common share were 2602 million and 204 respectively as a result of the adoption of sfas no123r and the related compensation remix 2005 net income included 130 million or 010 per share of sharebased and related compensation expense the 2005 results also included a net tax benefit of 73 million or 005 per share comprised of 179 million or 014 per share tax benefit due to a favorable audit settlement of the company’s 20002002 us tax returns and 106 million or 009 per share of incremental tax expense resulting from the decision to repatriate foreign earnings under hia in addition 2005 included impairment and other charges and credits that netted to 28 million of pretax income 12 million income after tax or 001 of income per share 

  

in 2004 net income and diluted net income per common share were 2279 million and 179 respectively or 168 per share including pro forma sharebased compensation expense of 011 per share the 2004 results included pretax operating charges of 160 million 105 million after tax or 008 per share related to a lease accounting correction and 130 million 116 million after tax or 009 per share related to asset and goodwill impairment charges primarily in south korea in 2004 results also included pretax nonoperating income of 49 million 49 million after tax or 004 per share relating to the sale of the company’s interest in a us real estate partnership that resulted in the utilization of certain previously unrealized capital loss carryforwards 

  

in 2003 net income and diluted net income per common share after cumulative effect of accounting change were 1471 million and 115 respectively or 098 per share including pro forma sharebased compensation expense of 017 per share the 2003 results included net pretax charges of 408 million 323 million after tax or 025 per share primarily related to the disposition of certain nonmcdonald’s brands and asset and goodwill impairment primarily in latin america 

  

refer to the impairment and other charges credits net section as well as the summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

for 2005 diluted weighted average shares outstanding were relatively flat compared to 2004 shares outstanding at the beginning of 2005 were higher than the prior year due to stock options exercised exceeding treasury stock purchased during 2004 treasury stock purchased in 2005 offset this higher balance as well as the impact of options exercised during the year 

  

in 2004 diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased compared to 2003 shares outstanding at the beginning of the year were lower than the prior year due to treasury stock purchased exceeding stock options exercised in 2003 partly offset by a higher dilutive effect of stock options outstanding 

  

impact of foreign currencies on reported results 

  

while changing foreign currencies affect reported results mcdonald’s mitigates exposures where practical by financing in local currencies hedging certain foreigndenominated cash flows and purchasing goods and services in local currencies 

  

in 2005 revenues were positively impacted by the brazilian real and the canadian dollar but operating income and net income were minimally impacted by foreign currency translation the euro had a minimal impact on reported results in 2004 and 2003 foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated revenues operating income and net income due to the strengthening of several major currencies primarily the euro 

  

impact of foreign currency translation on reported results 

  

   

   

 revenues 

  

in both 2005 and 2004 consolidated revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales as well as stronger foreign currencies 

  

revenues 

  

   

   

in the us the increase in revenues in 2005 was driven by multiple initiatives that are delivering variety like our new premium chicken sandwiches convenience such as cashless payment options and extended hours as well as our continued focus on value in 2004 the increase in revenues was due to the combined strength of the strategic menu marketing and service initiatives franchised and affiliated revenues increased at a higher rate than companyoperated sales in 2004 due to a higher percentage of franchised restaurants throughout the year compared with 2003 

  

europe’s increase in revenues for 2005 was due to strong comparable sales in russia which is entirely companyoperated and positive comparable sales in france and germany partly offset by negative comparable sales in the uk in 2004 the increase in europe’s revenues was due to strong comparable sales in russia and positive comparable sales in france the uk and many other markets partly offset by poor performance in germany 

  

in apmea revenues for 2005 benefited from strong comparable sales in australia and taiwan and were negatively impacted by the conversion of two markets about 325 restaurants to developmental licensee structures during 2005 in addition revenues benefited from expansion in china partly offset by that market’s negative comparable sales in 2004 the increase in apmea’s revenues was due primarily to strong performance in china and australia as well as positive comparable sales in many other markets partly offset by poor performance in south korea 

  

in latin america revenues in 2005 and 2004 increased in constant currencies primarily due to positive comparable sales in many markets and a higher percentage of companyoperated restaurants compared with prior years 

  

 the following tables present systemwide sales growth rates and the increase or decrease in comparable sales 

  

systemwide sales 

  

   

comparable sales–mcdonald’s restaurants 

  

   

operating margins 

  

operating margin information and discussions relate to mcdonald’s restaurants only and exclude nonmcdonald’s brands 

  

   

franchised margin dollars represent revenues from franchised and affiliated restaurants less the company’s occupancy costs rent and depreciation associated with those sites franchised margin dollars represented more than 65 of the combined operating margins in 2005 2004 and 2003 franchised margin dollars increased 246 million or 6 6 in constant currencies in 2005 and 427 million or 13 8 in constant currencies in 2004 the us and europe segments accounted for more than 85 of the franchised margin dollars in all three years 

  

franchised margins–mcdonald’s restaurants 

  

   

the consolidated franchised margin percent increased in 2005 and 2004 both periods benefited from strong comparable sales but reflected higher occupancy costs 

  

   

companyoperated margin dollars represent sales by companyoperated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants companyoperated margin dollars increased 96 million or 5 4 in constant currencies in 2005 and increased 308 million or 18 13 in constant currencies in 2004 the us and europe segments accounted for more than 75 of the companyoperated margin dollars in both periods 

  

companyoperated margins–mcdonald’s restaurants 

  

   

in the us the companyoperated margin percent in 2005 benefited from positive comparable sales more than offset by higher commodity labor and occupancy costs in 2004 the companyoperated margin percent increased primarily due to positive comparable sales partly offset by higher commodity costs and higher staffing levels commodity cost pressures are expected to ease in 2006 

  

in europe the companyoperated margin percent in 2005 decreased due to the uk primarily as a result of higher labor costs and negative comparable sales partly offset by strong performance in russia in addition higher beef costs had a negative impact across the segment for the year in 2004 russia’s strong performance also benefited the companyoperated margin percent but was more than offset by weak performance in germany and the uk as well as higher commodity costs across the segment commodities are expected to have a slightly negative impact in the first quarter of 2006 and remain relatively flat for the year 

  

in apmea the companyoperated margin percent in both 2005 and 2004 was negatively impacted by weak results in south korea partly offset by improvements in hong kong in addition 2004 benefited from improved performance in australia and china 

  

in latin america the companyoperated margin percent in both years reflected improved performance driven by strong comparable sales in brazil argentina and venezuela 

  

    

as noted earlier we continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance profits and returns although direct restaurant operation is more capitalintensive relative to franchising and results in lower operating margins as a percent of revenues companyoperated restaurants are important to our success in both mature and developing markets in our companyoperated restaurants we can develop and refine operating standards marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies so that we introduce systemwide only those that we believe are most beneficial in addition we firmly believe that owning restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor 

  

like other restaurant companies we report results for companyoperated restaurants based on their sales less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs and we report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues less associated occupancy costs for this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure we do not specifically allocate selling general  administrative expenses and other operating income expenses to companyoperated or franchised restaurants other operating items that relate to the companyoperated restaurants generally include gains on sales of restaurant businesses and to a lesser extent writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements 

  

we believe that the following supplemental information regarding our companyoperated restaurants in our most mature and significant markets will assist investors in understanding the performance of this business as if it were operated as franchised restaurants while this analysis would shift certain revenues and costs between companyoperated and franchised margins consolidated operating margins would not change in our companyoperated margins our occupancy expense outside rent expense and depreciation for buildings  leasehold improvements would be replaced by rents and service fees comparable to those paid by franchisees 

  

since selling general  administrative expenses are not specifically allocated to the companyoperated restaurant business an estimate of costs to support this business was made by the us canada and our three major markets in europe we believe on average a range of 40000 to 50000 per restaurant is typical but will vary depending on local circumstances and the structure of the market these costs reflect the support services we believe are necessary to provide the best customer experience other selling general  administrative costs to support the brand would be covered by a service fee charged to this business 

  

   

   

   

 selling general  administrative expenses 

  

consolidated selling general  administrative expenses increased 12 in 2005 and 8 in 2004 11 and 5 in constant currencies the sharebased and related incremental compensation expense due to the adoption of sfas no123r accounted for a majority of the constant currency increase in 2005 the constant currency increase in 2004 reflected higher performancebased incentive compensation 

  

selling general  administrative expenses as a percent of revenues were 109 in 2005 compared with 104 in 2004 and 107 in 2003 and selling general  administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales were 41 in 2005 compared with 39 in 2004 and 40 in 2003 the sharebased and related incremental compensation expense increased these ratios 09 percentage points and 03 percentage points respectively in 2005 management believes that analyzing selling general  administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales as well as revenues is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support systemwide restaurants

the table below details the pro forma sharebased expense for 2004 and 2003 for comparability purposes 

  

   

   

   

 impairment and other charges credits net 

  

on a pretax basis the company recorded impairment and other charges credits net of 28 million in 2005 290 million in 2004 and 408 million in 2003 associated with goodwill and asset impairment as well as a lease accounting correction in 2004 and certain strategic actions in 2003 mcdonald’s management does not include these items when reviewing business performance trends because we do not believe these items are indicative of expected ongoing results 

  

impairment and other charges credits net 

  

   

   

   

   

in 2005 and 2004 the company recorded 23 million and 130 million of pretax charges for impairment respectively primarily due to south korea and its continued poor results 

  

in 2003 the company recorded 136 million of net pretax charges consisting of 148 million primarily related to impairment in latin america 30 million for about 50 restaurant closings associated with strategic actions in latin america and a 42 million favorable adjustment to the 2002 charge for restaurant closings primarily due to about 85 fewer closings than originally anticipated 

  

   

in 2005 the company recorded 51 million of pretax income primarily due to favorable adjustments related to the conversion of a market to a developmental licensee in apmea and certain liabilities established in 2001 and 2002 due to lower than originally anticipated employeerelated and lease termination costs 

  

in 2003 the company recorded 272 million of pretax charges consisting of 237 million related to the loss on the sale of donatos pizzeria the closing of all donatos and boston market restaurants outside the us and the exit of a domestic joint venture with fazoli’s and 35 million related to revitalization plan actions of mcdonald’s japan 

  

   

during 2004 like other companies in the restaurant and retail industries the company reviewed its accounting practices and policies with respect to leasing transactions following this review and in consultation with its external auditors the company corrected an error in its prior practices to conform the lease term used in calculating straightline rent expense with the term used to amortize improvements on leased property the result of the correction primarily accelerated the recognition of rent expense under certain leases that include fixedrent escalations by revising the computation of straightline rent expense to include these escalations for certain option periods as the correction related solely to accounting treatment it did not affect mcdonald’s historical or future cash flows or the timing of payments under the related leases its effect on the company’s earning per share cash from operations and shareholders’ equity was immaterial these adjustments primarily impacted the us china boston market and chipotle other markets were less significantly impacted as many of the leases outside of the us do not contain fixedrent escalations

gains on sales of restaurant businesses include gains from sales of companyoperated restaurants as well as gains from exercises of purchase options by franchisees with business facilities lease arrangements arrangements where the company leases the businesses including equipment to franchisees who have options to purchase the businesses the company’s purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees and affiliates are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because the transactions are a recurring part of our business 

  

   

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates—businesses in which the company actively participates but does not control—is reported after interest expense and income taxes except for us restaurant partnerships which are reported before income taxes results in 2005 decreased primarily due to results at our japanese affiliate which included a onetime adjustment for restaurant employees’ back pay the increase in 2004 was primarily due to stronger performance in the us and improved results from our japanese affiliate 

  

   

asset dispositions and other expense consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions provisions for contingencies and uncollectible receivables and other miscellaneous expenses asset dispositions and other expense for 2005 reflected lower losses on asset dispositions and lower costs to acquire restaurants owned by litigating franchisees in brazil asset dispositions and other expense in 2004 reflected higher losses on asset dispositions compared with 2003 certain costs incurred to acquire restaurants operated by litigating franchisees in brazil and provisions for certain contingencies 

  

operating income 

  

consolidated operating income in 2005 and 2004 included higher combined operating margin dollars partly offset by higher selling general  administrative expenses when compared with the prior year

 the table below details the pro forma sharebased expense for 2004 and 2003 for comparability purposes 

  

   

   

   

the following discussion on operating income relates to pro forma increasedecrease excluding currency translation in the table above 

  

in 2005 and 2004 us operating income included higher combined operating margin dollars compared to 2004 and 2003 respectively selling general  administrative expense in 2005 was higher partly due to certain information technology expenses previously recorded in the corporate segment other operating expense decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 and increased in 2004 compared to 2003 due to higher asset dispositions in 2004 in 2004 operating income included charges related to the lease accounting correction of 70 million as well as impairment charges of 10 million 

  

in europe results for 2005 reflected strong performance in france and russia improved performance in germany and weak results in the uk in addition results included a supply chain charge of 24 million which negatively impacted the operating income growth rate by approximately 2 percentage points in 2004 results benefited from strong performances in france and russia as well as improved performance in italy offset by weak results in the uk and germany in addition 2004 results included impairment charges of 25 million 

  

in apmea results for 2005 were positively impacted by strong performance in australia partly offset by weak results in japan china and south korea in 2004 operating income also benefited from australia’s performance as well as improved performance in hong kong and china partly offset by poor results in south korea results for 2004 also included charges related to the lease accounting correction of 46 million as well as impairment charges of 93 million 

  

in latin america results for 2005 improved due to continued strong sales performance in most markets as well as lower costs to acquire restaurants owned by litigating franchisees in brazil when compared to 2004 in 2004 latin america’s operating loss decreased as compared with 2003 due to impairment charges in 2003 as well as significantly lower provisions for uncollectible receivables and improved performance in venezuela and argentina in addition operating income in 2004 included certain costs incurred to acquire restaurants owned by litigating franchisees in brazil

cash used for investing activities totaled 18 billion in 2005 an increase of 435 million primarily due to higher capital expenditures and increased purchases of restaurant businesses cash used for investing activities totaled 14 billion in 2004 flat compared with 2003 due to higher capital expenditures and lower sales of property offset by lower purchases of restaurant businesses 

  

cash from financing activities totaled 362 million in 2005 an increase of 20 billion primarily due to 29 billion of local borrowings related to hia and higher proceeds from employee stock option exercises the increase was partly offset by higher share repurchases higher debt repayments and an increase in the common stock dividend in 2004 cash used for financing activities totaled 16 billion a decrease of 103 million primarily due to higher proceeds from employee stock option exercises and lower debt repayments partly offset by higher share repurchases and an increase in the common stock dividend

moody’s standard  poor’s and fitch currently rate the company’s commercial paper p1 a1 and f1 respectively and its longterm debt a2 a and a respectively historically the company has not experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt the company’s key metrics for monitoring its credit structure are shown in the preceding table while the company targets these metrics for ease of focus it also looks at similar credit ratios that incorporate capitalized operating leases to estimate total adjusted debt total adjusted debt is a term that is commonly used by the rating agencies referred to above which includes debt outstanding on the company’s balance sheet plus an adjustment to capitalize operating leases based on their most recent calculations these agencies add between 7 billion and 10 billion of debt for lease capitalization purposes the company believes the rating agency methodology for capitalizing leases requires certain adjustments these adjustments include excluding percent rents in excess of minimum rents excluding certain companyoperated restaurant lease agreements outside the us that are cancelable with minimal penalties representing approximately 25 of companyoperated restaurant leases outside the us based on the company’s estimate capitalizing nonrestaurant leases using a multiple of three times rent expense and reducing total rent expense by a percentage of the annual minimum rent payments due to the company from franchisees operating 

  

 on leased sites based on this calculation for credit analysis purposes approximately 4 billion to 5 billion of future operating lease payments would be capitalized 

  

certain of the company’s debt obligations contain crossacceleration provisions and restrictions on company and subsidiary mortgages and the longterm debt of certain subsidiaries there are no provisions in the company’s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the company’s business the company has 13 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement see debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements as well as approximately 14 billion under a us shelf registration and 416 million under a euro mediumterm notes program for future debt issuance 

  

the company uses major capital markets bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense the company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring redeeming and repurchasing debt terminating exchange agreements and using derivatives the company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes all exchange agreements are overthecounter instruments 

  

in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations the company uses interest rate exchange agreements and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated all derivatives were recorded at fair value in the company’s consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2005 and 2004 primarily in miscellaneous other assets 83 million and 102 million respectively and other longterm liabilities 103 million and 218 million respectively see summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments for additional information regarding their use and the impact of sfas no133 regarding derivatives 

  

the company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties intercompany financings and longterm investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates in 2005 the company used foreign currency debt to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated cash and equivalents related to hia this reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders’ equity total foreign currencydenominated debt including the effects of foreign currency exchange agreements was 81 billion and 66 billion for the years ended 2005 and 2004 respectively in addition where practical the company’s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges 

  

the company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below or aggregate exposures exceed certain contractual limits at december 31 2005 and 2004 the company was required to post collateral of 24 million and 46 million respectively 

  

the company’s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies the company’s largest net asset exposures defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities at year end were as follows 

  

foreign currency net asset exposures 

  

   

the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the company’s results of operations cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments the interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10 in the same direction relative to the us dollar on all financial instruments however the analysis did not include the potential impact on sales levels local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the us based on the results of these analyses of the company’s financial instruments neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2005 levels nor a 10 adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2005 levels would materially affect the company’s results of operations cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments 

  

contractual obligations and commitments 

  

the company has longterm contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations related to both companyoperated and franchised restaurants and debt obligations in addition the company has longterm revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements cash provided by operations including cash provided by these franchise arrangements along with the company’s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations the following table summarizes the company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the company under existing franchise arrangements as of december 31 2005 see discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details

in addition to longterm obligations the company had guaranteed certain affiliate and other loans totaling 46 million at december 31 2005 

  

other matters 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates and judgements based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions 

  

the company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgement andor complexity 

  

   

property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straightline basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets taking into account anticipated technological or other changes the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors economic factors and industry trends if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense or writeoffs in future periods 

  

   

the company has sharebased compensation plans which authorize the granting of various equitybased incentives including stock options restricted stock and rsus to employees and nonemployee directors the expense for these equitybased incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and amortized over their vesting period 

  

the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closedform pricing model the pricing model requires assumptions such as the expected life of the stock option and expected volatility of the company’s stock over the expected life which significantly impact the assumed fair value the company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants sharebased compensation expense will fluctuate in future years the fair value of each rsu granted is equal to the market price of the company’s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period 

  

   

longlived assets including goodwill are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in assessing the recoverability of the company’s longlived assets the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors the biggest assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgements based on the company’s experience and knowledge of its operations these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions operating costs inflation competition and consumer and demographic trends if the company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future the company may be required to record impairment charges 

  

 losses on assets held for sale are recognized when management has approved and committed to a plan to sell the assets the assets are available for sale and probable of occurring within 12 months and the net sales proceeds from the assets are expected to be less than its net book value 

  

   

from time to time the company is subject to proceedings lawsuits and other claims related to competitors customers employees franchisees government agencies intellectual property shareholders and suppliers the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgements or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses a determination of the amount of accrual required if any for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters the company does not believe that any such matter will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 

  

   

the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if these estimates and assumptions change in the future the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance this could result in a charge to or an increase in income in the period such determination is made 

  

in addition the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter during 2005 the company recorded a 179 million benefit due to favorable audit settlement of the company’s 2000–2002 us tax returns during 2003 the company recorded a 102 million benefit due to favorable audit settlement of the company’s 19971999 tax returns the company’s 20032004 us tax returns are under audit the audit is expected to be completed in late 2006 or early 2007 and no estimate can be made of the benefit or charge if any resulting from the completion of the audit 

  

deferred us income taxes have not been recorded for basis differences totaling 39 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures the basis differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in the businesses if management’s intentions change in the future deferred taxes may need to be provided 

  

effects of changing prices–inflation 

  

the company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively this is because of rapid inventory turnover the ability to adjust menu prices cost controls and substantial property holdings many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation 

  

reconciliation of returns on incremental invested capital 

  

return on incremental invested capital roiic is a measure reviewed by management to determine the effectiveness of capital deployed roiic is calculated as a percentage and is calculated on a oneyear basis and a threeyear basis the numerator is the company’s constant foreign exchange rate excludes the impact of foreign currency translation incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization based on a comparison of the current and base periods the denominator is the constant foreign exchange rate weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities during the applicable one or threeyear period adjusted cash used for investing activities is defined as cash used for investing activities less net cash collections and issuances of notes receivable which do not generate operating income constant foreign exchange rate weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis detailed in the tables below these weightings reflect the relative contribution of each quarter’s investing activities to constant foreign exchange rate incremental operating income once the weightings are applied to the adjusted cash used for investing activities in each quarter the results are aggregated to arrive at the weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average 

  

 the reconciliations to the most comparable measurements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us for the numerator and denominator of the oneyear and threeyear roiic are as follows

the surviving counts in the amended complaint allege that mcdonald’s violated section 349 of the new york consumer protection act through the following conduct 1 the combined effect of mcdonald’s various promotional representations during the class period was to create the false impression that its food products were nutritionally beneficial and part of a healthy lifestyle if consumed daily 2 mcdonald’s failed adequately to disclose that its use of certain additives and the manner of its food processing rendered certain of its foods substantially less healthy than represented and 3 mcdonald’s deceptively represented that it would provide nutritional information to its new york customers when in reality such information was not readily available at a significant number of mcdonald’s outlets in new york visited by the plaintiffs and others

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

overview 

  

description of the business 

  

the company primarily operates and franchises mcdonald’s restaurants in addition the company operates certain nonmcdonald’s brands that are not material to the company’s overall results of the more than 30000 mcdonald’s restaurants in over 100 countries more than 8000 are operated by the company approximately 18000 are operated by franchiseeslicensees and about 4000 are operated by affiliates in general the company owns the land and building or secures longterm leases for restaurant sites regardless of who operates the restaurant this ensures longterm occupancy rights and helps control related costs 

  

revenues consist of sales by companyoperated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates these fees primarily include rent service fees andor royalties that are based on a percent of sales with specified minimum rent payments fees vary by type of site amount of company investment and local business conditions these fees along with occupancy and operating rights are stipulated in franchiselicense agreements that generally have 20year terms 

  

the business is managed as distinct geographic segments united states europe asiapacific middle east and africa apmea latin america and canada in addition throughout this report we present a segment entitled “other” that includes nonmcdonald’s brands eg boston market and chipotle mexican grill the us and europe segments each accounts for approximately 35 of total revenues france germany and the united kingdom account for about 65 of europe’s revenues australia china and japan a 50owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method account for over 45 of apmea’s revenues and brazil accounts for about 40 of latin america’s revenues these seven markets along with the us and canada are referred to as “major markets” throughout this report and comprise approximately 70 of total revenues 

  

in analyzing business trends management considers a variety of performance and financial measures including systemwide sales growth comparable sales growth operating margins and returns 

  

   

   

   

   

strategic direction and financial performance 

  

in 2002 the company’s results reflected a focus on growth through adding new restaurants with associated high levels of capital expenditures and debt financing this strategy combined with challenging economic conditions and increased competition in certain key markets adversely affected results and returns on investment 

  

in 2003 the company introduced a comprehensive revitalization plan to increase mcdonald’s relevance to today’s consumers as well as improve our financial discipline we redefined our strategy to emphasize growth through adding more customers to existing restaurants and aligned the system around our customerfocused plan to win designed to deliver operational excellence and leadership marketing this plan focuses on the five drivers of exceptional customer experiences—people products place price and promotion 

  

10 mcdonald’s corporation 

the nearterm goal of our revitalization plan was to fortify the foundation of our business by yearend 2004 we substantially achieved this goal 

  

we improved the taste of many of our core menu offerings and introduced products that have been well received by consumers such as new salad lines breakfast and chicken offerings we offered a variety of price options that appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers we streamlined processes such as new product development and restaurant operations improved our training programs and implemented performance measures including a restaurant review and measurement process to enable and motivate restaurant employees to serve customers better we have begun to remodel many of our restaurants to create more contemporary welcoming environments we also launched the “i’m lovin’ it” marketing theme which achieved high levels of consumer awareness worldwide and gained mcdonald’s recognition as 2004 marketer of the year by advertising age magazine 

  

over the past two years we have also exercised increased financial discipline we paid down debt reduced capital expenditures and reduced selling general  administrative expenses as a percent of revenues in addition we returned a significant amount of excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases 

  

for each quarter of 2004 mcdonald’s increased customer visits improved margins and delivered doubledigit growth in operating income and earnings per share in addition comparable sales were positive across all geographic segments during each and every quarter 

  

our 2004 performance reflected the underlying strength of our us business which generated impressive sales and margin improvements for the second consecutive year in europe our 2004 comparable sales for the year were 24 this indicates that we are making progress toward revitalizing this important business segment despite challenges in certain markets 

  

highlights from the year included 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

outlook for 2005 

  

the longterm goal of our revitalization plan was to create a differentiated customer experience—one that builds brand loyalty and delivers sustainable profitable growth for shareholders looking forward consistent with that goal we are targeting average annual systemwide sales and revenue growth of 3 to 5 average annual operating income growth of 6 to 7 and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens these targets exclude the impact of foreign currency translation 

  

as we move into 2005 we continue to execute our restaurant review and measurement process through a combination of graded restaurant visits anonymous mystery shops and customer surveys and we are rewarding high service levels with special incentives 

  

we also continue to evolve our menu to remain relevant in the us fruit n’ walnut salads as well as new premium chicken sandwiches will be added to the menu along with a new coffee blend in europe we will introduce a range of new products in canada toasted deli sandwiches were introduced during the fourth quarter of 2004 and a similar product line is being launched in australia in 2005 new products and branded everyday value remain a focus as we continue to refresh our offerings and feature our eurosaver menu in several european markets the amazing value menu in asia and the dollar menu in the us 

  

we continue our remodeling and rebuilding efforts and are enhancing our convenience with initiatives such as extended hours 

  

another priority in 2005 is our continued focus on the wellbeing of our customers we plan to build on the progress made last year through menu choice providing education and information about our food and encouraging physical activity through various programs and partnerships this year we will leverage our size reach and resources to positively impact millions of families worldwide 

  

we are confident in our plans for 2005 at the same time we recognize the challenges we face for example we must continue to deliver solid results in the us a very competitive marketplace despite difficult sales comparisons we believe that the combination of initiatives that benefited our us business in 2004 along with new products will continue to create positive momentum in 2005 

  

mcdonald’s corporation 11 

outside the us we must build on successes in some markets and overcome challenges in others notably some key markets must increase consumer relevance while others must build the business despite economic challenges we believe that we are in a better position to overcome these issues today than we have been for some time for example in 2005 we sent 20 million households in the uk a brand book that combines value offers with important information designed to educate our customers about our product quality balanced choices and social responsibility efforts additionally we introduced a value menu in germany an economically challenged market with heavy advertising support our plan is to leverage successes in markets such as the us australia and france to improve results in other countries 

  

in light of chipotle mexican grill’s strong performance and growing popularity we are exploring strategic alternatives to fuel growth of this emerging fastcasual brand which currently operates more than 400 restaurants we believe chipotle’s value and potential might be maximized through alternative strategies that could include raising additional equity capital in public or private markets this would have an additional benefit of enabling us to allocate more resources to growing sales and profits at existing mcdonald’s restaurants 

  

while the company does not provide specific guidance on earnings per share the following information is provided to assist in analyzing the company’s results 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

a number of factors can affect our business including the effectiveness of operating initiatives and changes in global and local business and economic conditions these and other risks are noted under forwardlooking statements at the end of management’s discussion and analysis

impairment and other charges net 

  

the company recorded charges associated with certain strategic actions as well as from annual goodwill and asset impairment testing in 2004 2003 and 2002 these charges generally represent actions or transactions related to the implementation of strategic initiatives of the company items that are unusual or infrequent in nature such as the dispositions of certain nonmcdonald’s brands in 2003 charges resulting from impairment testing and a lease accounting correction in 2004 mcdonald’s management does not include these items when reviewing business performance trends because we do not believe these items are indicative of expected ongoing results 

  

on a pretax basis the company recorded 241 million of impairment and other charges net in 2004 408 million of impairment and other charges in 2003 and 853 million of impairment and other charges in 2002 all items were recorded in other operating expense with the exception of the gain related to the sale of the company’s interest in a us real estate partnership during 2004 which was recorded in nonoperating income 

  

impairment and other charges–incomeexpense 

  

      

   

in 2004 the company recorded 130 million of pretax charges for asset and goodwill impairment primarily in south korea driven by its significant decline in performance over the past few years 

  

in 2003 the company recorded 136 million of net pretax charges consisting of 148 million primarily related to assetgoodwill impairment in latin america 30 million for about 50 restaurant closings associated with strategic actions in latin america and a 42 million favorable adjustment to the 2002 charge for restaurant closings primarily due to about 85 fewer closings than originally anticipated 

  

in 2002 the company recorded 402 million of pretax charges consisting of 302 million related to management’s decision to close about 750 underperforming restaurants primarily in the us and japan and 100 million primarily related to the impairment of assets for certain existing restaurants in europe and latin america most of the restaurants identified for closing had negative cash flows andor very low annual sales volumes also in many cases they would have required significant capital investment to remain financially viable 

  

   

in 2003 the company recorded 272 million of pretax charges consisting of 237 million related to the loss on the sale of donatos pizzeria the closing of all donatos and boston market restaurants outside the us and the exit of a domestic joint venture with fazoli’s and 35 million related to revitalization plan actions of mcdonald’s japan including headcount reductions the closing of pret a manger stores in japan and the early termination of a longterm management services agreement these actions were consistent with management’s strategy of concentrating the company’s capital and resources on the best nearterm opportunities and avoiding those that distract from restaurantlevel execution 

  

in 2002 the company initiated actions designed to optimize restaurant operations and improve the business and recorded 267 million of net pretax charges consisting of 201 million related to the anticipated transfer of ownership in five countries in the middle east and latin america to developmental licensees and ceasing operations in two countries in latin america 81 million primarily related to eliminating approximately 600 positions about half of which were in the us and half of which were in international markets reallocating resources and consolidating certain home office facilities to control costs and a 15 million favorable adjustment to the 2001 restructuring charge due to lower employeerelated costs than originally anticipated under the developmental license business structure which the company successfully employs in about 30 markets outside the us approximately 400 restaurants the licensee owns the business including the real estate interest while the company generally does not have any capital invested in these markets it receives a royalty based on a percent of sales 

  

14 mcdonald’s corporation 

   

like other companies in the restaurant and retail industries mcdonald’s recently reviewed its accounting practices and policies with respect to leasing transactions following this review and in consultation with its external auditors mcdonald’s has corrected an error in its prior practices to conform the lease term used in calculating straightline rent expense with the term used to amortize improvements on leased property the result of the correction is primarily to accelerate the recognition of rent expense under certain leases that include fixedrent escalations by revising the computation of straightline rent expense to include these escalations for certain option periods as the correction relates solely to accounting treatment it does not affect mcdonald’s historical or future cash flows or the timing of payments under the related leases and its effect on the company’s current or prior years’ earnings per share cash from operations and shareholders’ equity is immaterial these adjustments primarily impact the us china boston market and chipotle other markets were less significantly impacted as many of the leases outside of the us do not contain fixedrent escalations in 2005 we expect the rent expense related to this computation to be about 25 million of which about 40 relates to nonmcdonald’s brands 

  

   

in 2004 the company recorded a nonoperating gain of 49 million related to the sale of the company’s interest in a us real estate partnership as a result of this transaction the company was able to reverse a valuation allowance related to certain capital loss carryforwards see provision for income taxes in management’s discussion and analysis 

  

in 2002 the company recorded 184 million of pretax charges consisting of 170 million primarily related to the writeoff of software development costs as a result of management’s decision to terminate a longterm technology project and 14 million primarily related to the writeoff of receivables and inventory in venezuela as a result of the temporary closure of all mcdonald’s restaurants due to a national strike although the terminated technology project was expected to deliver longterm benefits it was no longer viewed as the best use of capital as the anticipated systemwide cost over several years was expected to be more than 1 billion 

  

impact of foreign currencies on reported results 

  

while changing foreign currencies affect reported results mcdonald’s lessens exposures where practical by financing in local currencies hedging certain foreigndenominated cash flows and purchasing goods and services in local currencies 

  

in 2004 and 2003 foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated revenues operating income and earnings per share due to the strengthening of several major currencies primarily the euro and british pound in 2002 foreign currency translation had a minimal impact on revenues as the stronger euro and british pound were offset by weaker latin american currencies primarily the argentine peso brazilian real and venezuelan bolivar however operating income in 2002 was positively impacted by foreign currency translation primarily due to the stronger euro and british pound

revenues 

  

in 2004 consolidated revenue growth was driven by positive performance in all segments as well as stronger foreign currencies consolidated revenue growth in 2003 was driven by stronger foreign currencies and strong performance in the us 

  

revenues 

  

   

in the us the increases in revenues in 2004 and 2003 were due to the combined strength of the strategic menu marketing and service initiatives also franchised and affiliated revenues increased at a higher rate than companyoperated sales due to a higher percentage of franchised restaurants throughout 2004 compared with 2003 while throughout 2003 there was a higher percentage of companyowned restaurants than in 2002 

  

in 2004 the increase in europe’s revenues was due to strong comparable sales in russia which is entirely companyoperated and positive comparable sales in france the uk and many other markets partly offset by germany’s poor performance in 2003 europe’s revenues reflected strong performance in russia driven by expansion and positive comparable sales along with expansion in france partly offset by weak results in the uk and germany 

  

in 2004 the increase in apmea’s revenues was due primarily to strong performance in china and australia as well as positive comparable sales in many other markets partly offset by poor performance in south korea in 2003 apmea’s revenues benefited from positive comparable sales in australia and expansion in china but were negatively affected by weak results in hong kong south korea and taiwan compounded by consumer concerns about severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in several markets in the first half of the year 

  

in latin america revenues in 2004 and 2003 increased in constant currencies primarily due to a higher percentage of companyoperated restaurants and positive comparable sales especially in 2004

operating margins 

  

operating margin information and discussions relate to mcdonald’s restaurants only and exclude nonmcdonald’s brands 

  

   

companyoperated margin dollars represent sales by companyoperated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants companyoperated margin dollars increased 308 million or 18 13 in constant currencies in 2004 and increased 182 million or 12 5 in constant currencies in 2003 the constant currency increase in both periods was primarily due to strong comparable sales 

  

companyoperated margins–mcdonald’s restaurants 

  

   

operating cost trends as a percent of sales were as follows food  paper costs increased in 2004 and decreased in 2003 payroll costs decreased in 2004 and were flat in 2003 and occupancy  other operating decreased in 2004 and increased in 2003 

  

in the us the companyoperated margin percent increased in 2004 primarily due to positive comparable sales partly offset by higher commodity costs and higher staffing levels the us companyoperated margin percent increased in 2003 primarily due to positive comparable sales and lower payroll as a percent of sales due to improved productivity and lower wage inflation partly offset by higher commodity costs 

  

in europe russia’s strong performance benefited the companyoperated margin percent for 2004 but was more than offset by weak performance in germany and the uk as well as higher commodity costs for the segment in 2003 europe’s companyoperated margin percent reflected weak performance in the uk partly offset by improved margin performance in germany and france 

  

in apmea the companyoperated margin percent in 2004 reflected improved performance in hong kong australia and china and poor performance in south korea in 2003 the margin declined significantly due to concerns of sars impacting sales in many markets partly offset by the sarsrelated sales tax relief received from the chinese government 

  

in latin america the companyoperated margin percent for 2004 reflected improved performance primarily in brazil argentina and venezuela in 2003 results reflected difficult economic conditions in these markets 

  

   

franchised margin dollars represent revenues from franchised and affiliated restaurants less the company’s occupancy costs rent and depreciation associated with those sites franchised margin dollars represented more than 65 of the combined operating margins in 2004 2003 and 2002 franchised margin dollars increased 427 million or 13 8 in constant currencies in 2004 and 341 million or 11 5 in constant currencies in 2003 

  

franchised margins–mcdonald’s restaurants 

  

   

  

mcdonald’s corporation 17 

the consolidated franchised margin percent increased for 2004 but slightly declined in 2003 both periods benefited from strong comparable sales but reflected higher occupancy costs due in part to an increased proportion of leased sites 

  

selling general  administrative expenses 

  

consolidated selling general  administrative expenses increased 8 in 2004 and 7 in 2003 5 and 3 in constant currencies the constant currency increases in 2004 and 2003 reflected higher performancebased incentive compensation in addition 2003 included severance and other costs associated with the strategic decision to reduce restaurant openings 

  

selling general  administrative expenses as a percent of revenues declined to 104 in 2004 compared with 107 in 2003 and 111 in 2002 and selling general  administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales declined to 39 in 2004 compared with 40 in 2003 and 41 in 2002 management believes that analyzing selling general  administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales as well as revenues is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support systemwide restaurants

gains on sales of restaurant businesses include gains from sales of companyoperated restaurants as well as gains from exercises of purchase options by franchisees with business facilities lease arrangements arrangements where the company leases the businesses including equipment to franchisees who have options to purchase the businesses the company’s purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees and affiliates are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because the transactions are a recurring part of our business 

  

   

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates–businesses in which the company actively participates but does not control–is reported after interest expense and income taxes except for us restaurant partnerships which are reported before income taxes the increase in 2004 was primarily due to stronger performance in the us and improved results from our japanese affiliate the increase in 2003 was primarily due to strong results in the us

in 2004 and 2003 us operating income included higher combined operating margin dollars partly offset by higher selling general  administrative expenses and higher other operating expenses excluding impairment charges and lease accounting correction compared to 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

europe’s constant currency results in 2004 benefited from strong performances in france and russia as well as improved performance in italy offset by weak results in the uk germany’s performance weakened during the second half of 2004 and we expect the economic challenges there to continue to impact our performance in the nearterm in 2003 europe’s constant currency results also benefited from strong performance in france and russia however difficult economic conditions in germany and weak results in the uk negatively impacted results 

  

in apmea operating income in constant currencies for 2004 benefited from australia’s performance as well as improved performance in hong kong and china partially offset by poor results in south korea apmea’s 2003 operating income reflected strong results in australia however weak results in most other markets compounded by concerns about sars in certain markets negatively impacted the segment 

  

in 2004 latin america’s operating loss decreased as compared with 2003 due to significantly lower provisions for uncollectible receivables and improved performance in venezuela and argentina in addition operating income in 2004 included certain costs incurred to acquire restaurants owned by litigating franchisees in brazil latin america’s operating income significantly declined in 2003 due to the continuing difficult economic conditions experienced by several key markets in the segment and significantly higher provisions for uncollectible receivables 

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense decreased in 2004 due to lower average debt levels and interest rates partly offset by stronger foreign currencies interest expense increased in 2003 due to stronger foreign currencies partly offset by lower average debt levels and interest rates 

  

nonoperating income expense net

nonoperating income expense in 2004 included a gain of 49 million related to the sale of the company’s interest in a us real estate partnership as well as higher interest income nonoperating expense in 2003 reflected an 11 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt as well as higher foreign currency translation losses compared with 2002 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

the following table presents the reported effective income tax rates as well as the effective income tax rates before impairment and other charges 

  

effective income tax rates 

    

the effective income tax rate for the full year 2004 benefited from an international transaction and the utilization of certain previously unrealized capital loss carryforwards both of which impacted 2004 only in 2003 and 2002 the effective income tax rates were negatively impacted by certain asset impairment and other charges that were not tax effected while 2004 has a lesser amount of such items 

  

consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets net of valuation allowance of 1319 million in 2004 and 1032 million in 2003 substantially all of the net tax assets arose in the us and other profitable markets 

  

cumulative effect of accounting changes 

  

effective january 1 2003 the company adopted sfas no143 accounting for asset retirement obligations which requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the obligations are incurred effective january 1 2002 the company adopted sfas no142 goodwill and other intangible assets which eliminates the amortization of goodwill and instead subjects it to annual impairment tests see summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

cash flows 

  

the company generates significant cash from operations and has substantial credit capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures debt repayments dividends and share repurchase 

  

cash from operations totaled 39 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by 25 billion in 2004 while cash from operations totaled 33 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by 20 billion in 2003 cash provided by operations increased 635 million in 2004 due to strong operating results primarily in the us and changes in working capital partly offset by higher income tax payments cash provided by operations increased 379 million in 2003 due to strong operating results primarily in the us partly offset by changes in working capital 

  

cash provided by operations 

  

   

20 mcdonald’s corporation 

cash used for investing activities totaled 14 billion in 2004 due to higher capital expenditures and lower sales of property offset by lower purchases of restaurant business cash used for investing activities also totaled 14 billion in 2003 a decrease of 11 billion compared with 2002 primarily due to lower capital spending as a result of fewer restaurant openings and fewer purchases of restaurant businesses 

  

cash used for financing activities totaled 16 billion in 2004 a decrease of 103 million primarily due to higher proceeds from employee stock option exercises partly offset by higher share repurchases and an increase in the common stock dividend in 2003 cash used for financing activities totaled 17 billion an increase of 12 billion primarily due to net debt repayments 

  

as a result of the above activity the company’s cash balance increased 887 million from december 31 2003 to 14 billion at december 31 2004 compared to an increase of 162 million from december 31 2002 to december 31 2003 

  

in addition to its cash provided by operations the company can meet shortterm funding needs through commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements accordingly the company purposefully maintains a relatively low current ratio which was 81 at yearend 2004 

  

restaurant development and capital expenditures 

  

as a result of the company’s strategically shifting its focus in 2003 from adding new restaurants to building sales at existing restaurants the company again reduced restaurant openings in 2004 the company opened 430 traditional mcdonald’s restaurants and 198 satellite restaurants small limitedmenu restaurants for which the land and building are generally leased and closed 185 traditional restaurants and 134 satellite restaurants about 70 of mcdonald’s restaurant additions occurred in the major markets in 2004 in 2003 the company opened 513 traditional mcdonald’s restaurants and 319 satellite restaurants and closed 486 traditional restaurants and 184 satellite restaurants 

  

systemwide restaurants at year end 1 

  

    

in 2005 the company expects to open about 550 traditional mcdonald’s restaurants and 150 satellite restaurants and close about 225 traditional restaurants and 125 satellite restaurants 

  

approximately 60 of companyoperated restaurants and more than 85 of franchised restaurants were located in the major markets at the end of 2004 franchisees and affiliates operated 73 of mcdonald’s restaurants at yearend 2004 nonmcdonald’s brand restaurants are primarily companyoperated 

  

capital expenditures increased 112 million or 9 in 2004 and decreased 697 million or 35 in 2003 the increase in capital expenditures in 2004 was consistent with the company’s strategy to increase investment in existing restaurants primarily in the us and europe partly offset by lower expenditures on restaurant openings in addition foreign currency translation increased capital expenditures by 48 million the decrease in capital expenditures in 2003 was primarily due to lower restaurant openings consistent with our shift in strategic focus partly offset by stronger foreign currencies foreign currency translation increased capital expenditures by 73 million capital expenditures for mcdonald’s restaurants in 2004 2003 and 2002 reflected the leasing of a higher proportion of new sites 

  

capital expenditures invested in major markets excluding japan represented between 65 and 70 of the total in 2004 2003 and 2002 japan is accounted for under the equity method and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts 

  

capital expenditures 

  

    

capital expenditures for new restaurants decreased 117 million or 19 in 2004 and 544 million or 47 in 2003 because the company opened fewer restaurants in both years concentrating new restaurant investments in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for longterm growth capital expenditures for existing restaurants increased in 2004 due to the company’s focus on growing sales at existing restaurants including reinvestment initiatives such as restaurant reimaging in several markets around the world including the us 

  

average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market these costs which include land buildings and equipment are managed through the use of optimally sized restaurants construction and design efficiencies leveraging best practices and sourcing globally in addition foreign currency fluctuations affect average development costs in 2005 the company is targeting 11 consolidated markets including the us for opening ten or more restaurants although the company is not responsible for all costs on every restaurant opened in 2004 total development costs consisting of land 

  

  

mcdonald’s corporation 21

the company has paid dividends on its common stock for 29 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year in 2004 the company declared a 38 increase in the annual dividend to 055 per share or 695 million reflecting the company’s confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow and positive results from its revitalization efforts as in the past future dividends will be considered after reviewing returns to shareholders profitability expectations and financing needs and will be declared at the discretion of the board of directors cash dividends are declared and paid on an annual basis 

  

financial position and capital resources 

  

total assets and returns 

  

total assets grew by 20 billion or 8 in 2004 and 16 billion or 7 in 2003 changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased total assets by approximately 10 billion in 2004 and 19 billion in 2003 at yearend 2004 and 2003 nearly 70 of consolidated assets were located in the major markets net property and equipment rose 7784 million in 2004 and represented 74 of total assets at year end 

  

operating income is used to compute return on average assets while income before the cumulative effect of accounting changes is used to calculate return on average common equity monthend balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity 

  

returns on assets and equity 

  

   

impairment and other charges reduced return on average assets by 09 percentage points in 2004 14 percentage points in 2003 and 36 percentage points in 2002 in addition these charges reduced return on average common equity by 13 percentage points in 2004 28 percentage points in 2003 and 70 percentage points in 2002 in 2004 return on average assets and return on average common equity both increased due to strong operating results in the us and improved results in europe in 2003 return on average assets and return on average common equity both began to stabilize due to strong operating results in the us partly offset by weak operating results in most markets in apmea and latin america during 2005 the company will continue to concentrate mcdonald’s restaurant openings and new capital invested in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for longterm growth such as china 

  

financing and market risk 

  

the company generally borrows on a longterm basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations debt obligations at december 31 2004 totaled 92 billion compared with 97 billion at december 31 2003 the net decrease in 2004 was due to net payments 815 million and sfas no133 noncash fair value adjustments 19 million partly offset by the impact of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt 323 million 

  

debt highlights 1 

  

      

moody’s standard  poor’s and fitch currently rate the company’s commercial paper p1 a1 and f1 respectively and its longterm debt a2 a and a respectively historically the company has not experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt the company’s key metrics for monitoring its credit structure are shown in the preceding table while the company targets these metrics for ease of focus it also looks at similar credit ratios that incorporate capitalized operating leases to estimate total adjusted debt total adjusted debt is a term that is commonly used by the rating agencies referred to above which includes debt outstanding on the company’s balance sheet plus an adjustment to capitalize operating leases two of the three agencies use a multiple of eight times rent expense the company also uses this methodology in combination with certain other adjustments to more accurately reflect its total net lease commitments these adjustments include excluding percent rents in excess of minimum rents excluding certain companyoperated 

  

22 mcdonald’s corporation 

restaurant lease agreements outside the us that are cancelable with minimal penalties representing approximately 20 of companyoperated restaurant leases outside the us based on the company’s estimate capitalizing nonrestaurant leases using a multiple of three times rent expense and reducing total rent expense by approximately half of the annual minimum rent payments due to the company from franchisees operating on leased sites based on this calculation for credit analysis purposes approximately 4 billion of future operating lease payments would be capitalized 

  

certain of the company’s debt obligations contain crossacceleration provisions and restrictions on company and subsidiary mortgages and the longterm debt of certain subsidiaries there are no provisions in the company’s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the company’s business the company has 13 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement see debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements as well as approximately 14 billion under a us shelf registration and 607 million under a euro mediumterm notes program for future debt issuance 

  

the company uses major capital markets bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense the company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring redeeming and repurchasing debt terminating exchange agreements and using derivatives the company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes all exchange agreements are overthecounter instruments 

  

in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations the company uses interest rate exchange agreements and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated all derivatives were recorded at fair value in the company’s consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2004 and 2003 as follows miscellaneous other assets–102 million and 102 million other longterm liabilities excluding accrued interest–218 million and 136 million and accrued payroll and other liabilities 17 million and 29 million see summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments for additional information regarding their use and the impact of sfas no133 regarding derivatives 

  

the company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties intercompany financings and longterm investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates this reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders’ equity total foreign currency denominated debt including the effects of foreign currency exchange agreements was 66 billion and 68 billion for the years ended 2004 and 2003 respectively in addition where practical the company’s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges 

  

the company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below or aggregate exposures exceed certain contractual limits at december 31 2004 and 2003 the company was required to post collateral of 46 million and 12 million respectively 

  

the company’s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies the company’s largest net asset exposures defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities at year end were as follows 

  

foreign currency net asset exposures 

  

   

the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the company’s results of operations cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments the interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10 in the same direction relative to the us dollar on all financial instruments however the analysis did not include the potential impact on sales levels local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the us based on the results of these analyses of the company’s financial instruments neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2004 levels nor a 10 adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2004 levels would materially affect the company’s results of operations cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments 

  

contractual obligations and commitments 

  

the company has longterm contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations related to both companyoperated and franchised restaurants and debt obligations in addition the company has longterm revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements cash provided by operations including cash provided by these franchise arrangements along with the company’s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations the following table summarizes the company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the company under existing franchise arrangements as of december 31 2004 see discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources

as well as the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

  

    

the company maintains a nonqualified unfunded supplemental plan that allows participants to i make taxdeferred contributions and ii receive companyprovided allocations that cannot be made under the profit sharing and savings plan because of internal revenue service limitations the investment alternatives and returns in the supplemental plan are based on certain marketrate investment alternatives under the profit sharing and savings plan total liabilities under the supplemental plan were 350 million at december 31 2004 and 329 million at december 31 2003 and were included in other longterm liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 

  

in addition to longterm obligations the company had guaranteed certain affiliate and other loans totaling 70 million at december 31 2004 

  

other matters 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates and judgements based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions 

  

the company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgement andor complexity 

  

   

property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straightline basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets taking into account anticipated technological or other changes the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors economic factors and industry trends if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense in future periods 

  

   

longlived assets including goodwill are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in assessing the recoverability of the company’s longlived assets the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors the biggest assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgements based on the company’s experience and knowledge of its operations these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions operating costs inflation competition and consumer and demographic trends if the company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future the company may be required to record impairment charges 

  

   

the company has recorded charges related to restructuring markets closing restaurants eliminating positions and other strategic changes the accruals recorded included estimates pertaining to employee termination costs number of restaurants to be closed and remaining lease obligations for closed facilities although the company does not anticipate significant changes the actual costs may differ from these estimates 

  

from time to time the company is subject to proceedings lawsuits and other claims related to competitors customers employees franchisees intellectual property shareholders and suppliers the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgements or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses a determination of the amount of accrual required if any for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters the company does not believe that any such matter will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 

  

24 mcdonald’s corporation 

   

the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if these estimates and assumptions change in the future the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance this could result in a charge to or an increase in income in the period such determination is made 

  

in addition the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter the company expects to settle the audits of its 2000 through 2002 us tax returns in the first half of 2005 

  

deferred us income taxes have not been recorded for basis differences totaling 55 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures the basis differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings and other than the potential repatriation of earnings under the new tax law as described below these earnings are considered permanently invested in the businesses if management’s intentions change in the future deferred taxes may need to be provided 

  

on october 22 2004 the president signed the american jobs creation act of 2004 the “act” the act creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and as of today uncertainty remains as to how to interpret numerous provisions in the act as such we have not yet decided on whether and to what extent we might repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the us based on our analysis to date however it is reasonably possible that we may repatriate between 0 and 32 billion with the respective tax liability ranging from 0 to 100 million we expect to finalize our assessment once clarifying guidance is issued 

  

new accounting standards 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued statement no123r sharebased payment effective third quarter 2005 for the company which is a revision of fasb statement no123 accounting for stockbased compensation statement 123r supersedes apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees and amends fasb statement no 95 statement of cash flows generally the approach in statement 123r is similar to the approach described in statement 123 however statement 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 

  

as permitted by statement 123 the company currently accounts for sharebased payments to employees using the intrinsic value method and as such generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options accordingly the adoption of statement 123r’s fair value method will have an impact on our results of operations 

  

the company expects to adopt statement 123r during the first quarter 2005 using the modifiedretrospective method restating prior periods had we adopted statement 123r in prior periods the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement 123 as described in the pro forma disclosures in the summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements 

  

partly in anticipation of these new accounting rules the company modified its compensation plans to limit eligibility to receive sharebased compensation and shifted a portion of sharebased compensation primarily to cashbased incentive compensation we expect the 2005 impact of the adoption of statement 123r combined with the modifications to the company’s compensation plans to be about 010 per share of expense 

  

statement 123r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as required under the current rules this requirement will reduce net operating cash flow and increase net financing cash flow 

  

effects of changing–inflation

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

overview 

  

description of the business 

  

the company primarily operates and franchises mcdonald’s restaurants in addition the company operates certain nonmcdonald’s brands that are not material to the company’s overall results of the more than 30000 mcdonald’s restaurants in over 100 countries more than 8000 are operated by the company approximately 18000 are operated by franchisees and about 4000 are operated by affiliates under license agreements regardless of who operates the restaurant the company generally owns the land and building or secures longterm leases for restaurant sites this ensures longterm occupancy rights and helps control related costs 

  

revenues consist of sales by companyoperated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates these fees primarily include rent service fees andor royalties that are based on a percent of sales with specified minimum rent payments fees vary by type of site investment by the company and local business conditions these fees along with occupancy and operating rights are stipulated in franchise agreements that generally have 20year terms 

  

we manage the business based on geographic segments united states europe asiapacific the middle east and africa apmea latin america and canada in addition throughout this report we present a segment entitled “other” that includes nonmcdonald’s brands the us and europe segments account for approximately 70 of total revenues france germany and the united kingdom account for about 65 of europe’s revenues australia china and japan a 50owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method account for about 45 of apmea’s revenues and brazil accounts for about 40 of latin america’s revenues these seven markets along with the us and canada are referred to as “major markets” throughout this report and comprise approximately 70 of total revenues 

  

in analyzing business trends management considers a variety of performance and financial measures including systemwide sales growth comparable sales growth and companyoperated margins systemwide sales include sales by all restaurants whether operated by the company by franchisees or by affiliates while sales by franchisees and affiliates are not recorded as revenues by the company management believes the information is important in understanding the company’s financial performance because they are the basis on which the company calculates and records franchised and affiliated revenues and are indicative of the financial health of our franchisee base comparable sales are a key performance indicator used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the company’s initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends increases or decreases in comparable sales represent the percent change in constant currency sales from the same period in the prior year for all systemwide restaurants in operation at least thirteen months constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain compensation plans on these results because the company believes they better represent the underlying business trends 

  

strategic direction and 2003 financial performance 

  

in 2001 and 2002 the company’s results reflected a focus on growth through adding new restaurants with associated high levels of capital expenditures and increasing levels of debt financing this strategy combined with challenging economic conditions and increased competition in certain key markets adversely affected results and returns on investment 

  

in 2003 the company introduced a comprehensive revitalization plan to increase mcdonald’s relevance to today’s consumers as well as improve our financial discipline we redefined our strategy to emphasize growth through adding more customers to existing restaurants in line with this we took a more disciplined approach to capital allocation and put a greater emphasis on controlling expenses we aligned the system around our customerfocused plan to win designed to deliver operational excellence and leadership marketing this plan contains aggressive goals and measures for success based on the five drivers of exceptional customer experiences—people products place price and promotion 

  

our nearterm goal was to fortify the foundation of our business our longterm goal is to create a differentiated customer experience—one that builds brand loyalty—and enables us to deliver attractive top and bottomline growth and returns on a sustained basis for 2005 and beyond mcdonald’s is targeting annual systemwide sales and revenue growth of 3 percent to 5 percent annual operating income growth of 6 percent to 7 percent and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens return on incremental invested capital is the change in operating income plus depreciation divided by the change in gross assets these targets exclude the impact of foreign currency translation 

  

we made significant progress in 2003 in operational excellence and leadership marketing we improved our core menu and added several successful new products we used more consistent rigorous measurements such as evaluations by company personnel independent mystery shoppers and customer research to evaluate restaurant performance using this information along with enhanced training and other processes we have strengthened our operations we have expanded our everyday value offerings attracting more customer visits we began to create more relevant 

  

mcdonald’s corporation 9 

restaurant environments by updating rebuilding and relocating some of our restaurants we also introduced our first global marketing strategy embodied by the “i’m lovin’ it” theme which emphasizes more contemporary music and images and is connecting with both our customers and our employees 

  

from a financial perspective our results also improved in 2003 in concert with the company’s strategic shift to emphasize growth from existing restaurants management is focusing in particular on comparable sales and companyoperated margin trends both of which gained momentum during the year performance in the us was impressive with robust annual comparable sales and margin increases in europe while comparable sales were slightly negative for the year they improved sequentially each quarter as did companyoperated margins compared with the prior year apmea’s comparable sales and companyoperated margins declined for the year but both showed significant improvement in the second half 

  

as part of the company’s revitalization plan we eliminated projects not directly affecting our customers’ experience and narrowed nonmcdonald’s brand activities these actions along with the write down of a portion of our goodwill and restaurant assets resulted in the company recording 408 million of pretax charges primarily noncash in 2003

outlook for 2004 

  

we expect 2004 to be a year of ongoing progress in operational excellence leadership marketing and key financial metrics we will continue to focus our revitalization efforts on improving our customers’ experiences by providing better service enhancing food taste menu variety and value offerings and creating more relevant marketing while we are confident in our plans for 2004 we also are conscious of the challenges we face for example we must continue to deliver solid results in the us a very competitive marketplace despite sequentially more difficult sales comparisons we believe that the combination of initiatives that benefited our us business in 2003 will continue to create positive momentum in 2004 

  

outside the us some key markets must increase customer relevance while others have economic challenges we believe that we are in a better position to overcome these issues today than we have been for some time our plan is to leverage successes in the us and other markets like australia—such as more relevant menus strong value platforms creative marketing and better restaurantlevel execution—to improve results in additional markets around the world 

  

while the company does not provide specific guidance on earnings per share the following information is provided to assist in analyzing the company’s results

strategic actions 

  

in 2003 the company eliminated projects not directly impacting its customers’ experience narrowed its nonmcdonald’s brand activities aligned its system around a single action plan plan to win and reestablished mcdonald’s marketing leadership through the introduction of its first ever global brand strategy embodied by the “i’m lovin’ it” theme these actions were consistent with management’s strategy of concentrating the company’s capital and resources on the best nearterm opportunities and avoiding those that distract from restaurantlevel execution 

  

in 2002 the company initiated actions designed to optimize restaurant operations and improve the business they included the restructuring of certain international markets the closing of a significant number of underperforming restaurants the decision to terminate a longterm technology project and the consolidation of certain home office facilities and elimination of positions to control costs streamline operations and reallocate resources 

  

mcdonald’s corporation 11 

in 2001 the company also implemented structural changes and restaurant initiatives primarily in the us the changes included streamlining operations by reducing the number of us regions and divisions enabling the company to combine staff functions and improve efficiency 

  

the company recorded charges associated with certain of the above actions as “special items” special items generally represent actions or transactions related to the implementation of strategic initiatives of the company items that are unusual or infrequent in nature such as the dispositions of certain nonmcdonald’s brands in 2003 and the japan ipo gain in 2001 and charges resulting from annual goodwill and asset impairment testing mcdonald’s management does not include these items when reviewing business performance trends because they do not believe these items are indicative of expected ongoing results 

  

on a pretax basis the company recorded 408 million of special charges in 2003 853 million of special charges in 2002 and 253 million of special items in 2001 all special items were recorded in other operating expense except as noted in the discussion that follows

in 2002 the company recorded 267 million of net pretax charges consisting of 201 million related to the anticipated transfer of ownership in five countries in the middle east and latin america to developmental licensees and ceasing operations in two countries in latin america 81 million primarily related to eliminating approximately 600 positions about half of which were in the us and half of which were in international markets reallocating resources and consolidating certain home office facilities to control costs and a 15 million favorable adjustment to the 2001 restructuring charge due to lower employeerelated costs than originally anticipated under the developmental license business structure which the company successfully employs in about 30 markets outside the us approximately 400 restaurants the licensee owns the business including the real estate interest while the company generally does not have any capital invested in these markets it receives a royalty based on a percent of sales

revenues 

  

consolidated revenue growth in 2003 was driven by stronger foreign currencies and a strong performance in the us in 2002 consolidated revenue growth was driven by expansion and a higher percentage of companyoperated restaurants compared with 2001 

  

revenues 

  

   

in the us ongoing menu service and value initiatives drove the increase in revenues in 2003 as the us achieved its highest annual comparable sales increase since 1987 these initiatives included the introduction of premium salads and mcgriddles breakfast sandwiches the dollar menu extended hours a heightened focus on operations more disciplined measurements and a new marketing direction results also reflected improvement in the us economy in 2003 in 2002 revenues increased slightly due to restaurant expansion results in 2002 in part reflected the overall slowdown in the restaurant industry and increased competition 

  

in 2003 and 2002 europe’s revenues reflected strong performance in russia driven by expansion and positive comparable sales along with expansion in france these results were partly offset by weak results in the uk and germany although germany’s performance improved in the second half of 2003 

  

in 2003 and 2002 apmea’s revenues benefited from positive comparable sales in australia and expansion in china revenues were negatively affected in 2003 by weak results in hong kong south korea and taiwan compounded by consumer concerns about severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in several markets in the first half of the year in addition japan had negative comparable sales for 2003 and 2002 although the market’s performance improved in the fourth quarter of 2003 in 2002 revenues reflected a benefit from the restructuring of our ownership in the philippines effective july 2001 that resulted in the reclassification of franchised restaurants to companyoperated 

  

in latin america revenues in 2003 increased in constant currencies primarily due to a higher percentage of companyoperated restaurants the increase in revenues in 2002 was primarily due to positive comparable sales in brazil and expansion in mexico

in 2003 us operating income included higher combined operating margin dollars higher selling general  administrative expenses and higher other operating expenses excluding special charges us operating income in 2002 included lower combined operating margin dollars lower selling general  administrative expenses and lower other operating income excluding special charges 

  

europe’s constant currency results in 2003 and 2002 benefited from strong performances in france and russia however difficult economic conditions in germany and weak results in the uk negatively impacted results in both years despite the difficult economic conditions germany’s performance improved in the second half of 2003 

  

apmea’s constant currency results in 2003 reflected strong results in australia however weak results in most other markets compounded by concerns about sars in certain markets negatively impacted the segment in 2002 strong results in australia were more than offset by weak results in japan and hong kong 

  

latin america’s operating income in constant currencies significantly declined in both 2003 and 2002 due to the continuing difficult economic conditions experienced by several key markets in the segment in addition latin america’s results for both years were negatively impacted by higher provisions for uncollectible receivables the company is currently in litigation with about onethird of the franchisees in brazil which is negatively impacting the company’s results in latin america we expect this to continue in the near term

companyoperated margins–mcdonald’s restaurants 

  

   

operating cost trends as a percent of sales were as follows food  paper costs decreased in 2003 and 2002 payroll costs were flat in 2003 and increased in 2002 and occupancy  other operating expenses increased in both years 

  

the us companyoperated margin percent increased in 2003 primarily due to positive comparable sales and lower payroll as a percent of sales due to improved productivity and lower wage inflation higher commodity costs partly offset these trends in 2002 the us companyoperated margin percent benefited from the elimination of goodwill amortization and a lower advertising contribution rate while weak comparable sales and higher labor costs negatively impacted the margin 

  

in 2003 europe’s companyoperated margin percent reflected weak performance in the uk which has the largest number of companyoperated restaurants in europe partly offset by improved margin performance in germany and france in 2002 europe’s companyoperated margin percent reflected higher labor costs and an increase in occupancy  other operating expenses

franchised margins–mcdonald’s restaurants 

  

   

the consolidated franchised margin percent declined slightly in 2003 as positive comparable sales were offset by higher occupancy costs due in part to an increased proportion of leased sites the decline in the consolidated franchised margin percent in 2002 reflected negative comparable sales higher rent assistance to franchisees primarily in the us and europe and higher occupancy costs due in part to an increased proportion of leased sites 

  

selling general  administrative expenses 

  

consolidated selling general  administrative expenses increased 7 in 2003 and 3 in 2002 3 and 4 in constant currencies the constant currency increase in 2003 was primarily due to higher performancebased incentive compensation as well as severance and other costs associated with the strategic decision to reduce restaurant openings the constant currency increase in 2002 was primarily due to higher spending on technology in the corporate segment higher advertising expenses in the us primarily related to the introduction of the dollar menu and higher expenses for nonmcdonald’s brands 

  

mcdonald’s corporation 17 

selling general  administrative expenses as a percent of revenues declined to 107 in 2003 compared with 111 in 2002 and 112 in 2001 and selling general  administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales declined to 40 in 2003 compared with 41 in 2002 and 2001 management believes that analyzing selling general  administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales as well as revenues is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support systemwide restaurants

cash provided by operations 

  

   

in addition to its cash provided by operations the company can meet shortterm funding needs through commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements accordingly the company purposefully maintains a relatively low current ratio which was 76 at yearend 2003 

  

restaurant development and capital expenditures

capital expenditures decreased 697 million or 35 in 2003 and increased 98 million or 5 in 2002 the decrease in capital expenditures in 2003 was primarily due to lower restaurant openings consistent with our shift in strategic focus partly offset by stronger foreign currencies foreign currency translation increased capital expenditures by 73 million the increase in 2002 was primarily due to higher spending in the us and canada partly offset by lower capital expenditures for new restaurants in latin america capital expenditures for mcdonald’s restaurants 

  

mcdonald’s corporation 19 

in 2003 2002 and 2001 reflected the leasing of a higher proportion of new sites and a program that gave us franchisees the option to purchase new restaurant buildings 

  

during 2003 the company began to phase out the option for us franchisees to purchase new restaurant buildings consequently the company is currently purchasing most buildings and as a result collects additional rent from the franchisees 

  

capital expenditures invested in major markets excluding japan represented approximately 70 of the total in 2003 and 2002 and 60 in 2001 japan is accounted for under the equity method and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts 

  

capital expenditures 

  

     

capital expenditures for new restaurants decreased 544 million or 47 in 2003 because the company opened fewer restaurants and concentrated new restaurant investments in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for longterm growth while capital expenditures for existing restaurants decreased in 2003 they increased as a percentage of total capital spending this is due to the company’s focus on growing sales at existing restaurants including reinvestment initiatives such as restaurant reimaging in several markets around the world including the us 

  

average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market these costs which include land buildings and equipment owned by the company are managed through the use of optimally sized restaurants construction and design efficiencies standardization and global sourcing in addition foreign currency fluctuations affect average development costs in 2004 the company is targeting eleven consolidated markets including the us for opening ten or more restaurants although the company is not responsible for all costs on every restaurant opened in 2003 total development costs consisting of land buildings and equipment for new traditional mcdonald’s restaurants averaged approximately 18 million in the us and approximately 17 million in the ten markets outside the us

returns on assets and equity 

  

   

special charges reduced return on average assets by 14 points in 2003 36 points in 2002 and 18 points in 2001 in addition these charges reduced return on average common equity by 28 points in 2003 70 points in 2002 and 16 points in 2001 in 2003 return on average assets and return on average common equity both began to stabilize due to strong operating results in the us partly offset by continued weak operating results in most markets in apmea and latin america in 2002 return on average assets and return on average common equity both declined primarily due to weak operating results in apmea and latin america during 2004 the company will continue to concentrate mcdonald’s restaurant openings and new capital invested in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for longterm growth

mcdonald’s corporation 21 

the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the company’s results of operations cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments the interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10 in the same direction relative to the us dollar on all financial instruments however the analysis did not include the potential impact on sales levels or local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the us based on the results of these analyses of the company’s financial instruments neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2003 levels nor a 10 adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2003 levels would materially affect the company’s results of operations cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments 

  

contractual obligations and commitments

other matters 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

the company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

  

property and equipment 

  

property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straightline basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets taking into account anticipated technological or other changes the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors economic factors and industry trends if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense in future periods 

  

22 mcdonald’s corporation 

longlived assets 

  

longlived assets including goodwill are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in assessing the recoverability of the company’s longlived assets the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors the biggest assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the company’s experience and knowledge of operations these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions operating costs inflation competition and consumer and demographic trends if the company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future the company may be required to record impairment charges 

  

restructuring and litigation accruals 

  

the company has recorded charges related to restructuring markets closing restaurants eliminating positions and other strategic changes the accruals recorded included estimates pertaining to employee termination costs number of restaurants to be closed and remaining lease obligations for closed facilities although the company does not anticipate significant changes the actual costs may differ from these estimates 

  

from time to time the company is subject to proceedings lawsuits and other claims related to franchisees suppliers employees customers competitors and intellectual property the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses a determination of the amount of accrual required if any for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters the company does not believe that any such matter will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 

  

income taxes 

  

the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if these estimates and assumptions change in the future the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance this could result in a charge to or an increase in income in the period such determination is made 

  

deferred us income taxes have not been recorded for basis differences totaling 42 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries or affiliates the basis differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings considered permanently invested in the businesses if management’s intentions change in the future deferred taxes may need to be provided 

  

in addition the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 

  

effects of changing prices – inflation
