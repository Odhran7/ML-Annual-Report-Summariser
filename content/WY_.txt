effect of market conditions

the health of the us housing market strongly affects the performance of all our business segments our wood products segment primarily sells into the new residential building and repair and remodel markets demand for sawlogs within our timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of woodbased building products as well as export markets seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the us generally characterized by a reduction in activity during the winter months which in turn affects the demand for our logs and wood products real estate is affected by the health of the us economy and local real estate market conditions such as the level of supply or demand for properties sharing the same or similar characteristics as our timberlands energy and natural resources is affected by underlying demand for commodities including natural gas and minerals

competition in our markets

we operate in highly competitive domestic and foreign markets with numerous companies selling similar products many of our products also face competition from substitutes for wood products we compete in our markets primarily through product quality service levels and price we are relentlessly focused on operational excellence producing quality products customers want and are willing to pay for at the lowest possible cost

our business segments’ competitive strategies are as follows

 



 

 

environmental social and governance esg practices

 

sustainability is one of the core values of our company and we have spent decades building a solid foundation characterized by excellence in environmental stewardship social responsibility and corporate governance maintaining a strong esg foundation is a key component of our ability to drive longterm shareholder value and these principles guide us in how we conduct our business every day 

environmental stewardship

as a pioneer in sustainable forestry we have environmental stewardship deeply rooted in our business and very much at the core of our company to operate successfully we need our forests to provide a sustainable supply of wood fiber now and long into the future to ensure our forests remain healthy and valuable for decades to come we protect and enhance the many additional benefits they provide such as clean water clean air and critical areas for biodiversity we also minimize our environmental footprint in our wood products manufacturing business including reducing air emissions minimizing waste and maximizing wood recovery these actions are smart for our business good for the environment and essential to how we run our operations sustainably 

practicing sustainable forestry

as one of the world’s oldest and largest private timberland owners we’ve been growing harvesting and regrowing forests for more than a century our goal is to ensure a sustainable supply of wood for our customers while protecting the other important benefits forests provide we know forests can be managed on a sustainable basis indefinitely and we have been proving it is possible for a very long time we advocated for legislation in 1925 to encourage reforestation after harvest which was an uncommon practice at the time in 1937 we began research into sustainable yield forestry which ensures harvesting does not diminish the forest’s ability to provide the same volume in the future in 1938 we were one of the first companies to plant tree seedlings and in 1941 we established the first certified tree farm in the us we harvest on average only two percent of our forests each year and 100 percent of our timberlands are reforested after harvesting on average we plant 130 to 150 million tree seedlings per year 

storing carbon

our sustainably managed forests play a critical role in helping to mitigate climate change as our millions of acres of forests grow they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in their trunks limbs and roots as well as in the soil in 2020 our forests contained between 23 

weyerhaeuser company  2021 annual report and form 10k 2 

 

billion and 36 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent mtco 2 e approximately 10 billion mtco 2 e wa s stored in our trees and roots and an additional 13 billion to 26 billion mtco 2 e wa s stored in soil and other biomass after our trees are harvested much of their carbon remains stored in the longlived wood products made from them for the life of those products after harvest we plant millions more trees which immediately begin absorbing more co 2 from the atmosphere and the next round of wood products store more carbon yet again our managed forests also provide other climate benefits  they mature more quickly and are able to bank more carbon through faster continuous rotations all while maintaining the vast pool of carbon in the forest soil and using wood for construction requires less energy and results in fewer greenhouse gas emissions compared with other building materials such as steel and concrete 

our carbon record

we are dedicated to maintaining a leadership position within our sector in the area of climaterelated disclosures in 2021 we reached a significant milestone in publishing our inaugural carbon record our carbon record shows that our net impact is significantly carbon negative meaning we remove substantially more carbon from the atmosphere than we emit each year in 2020 our carbon removals totaled approximately 32 million mtco 2 e this was comprised of 10 million mtco 2 e of direct carbon removals from our us timberlands the increase in aboveground carbon attributable to forest growth and management practices after we account for harvest and mortality and an additional 22 million mtco 2 e of scope 3 removals across our value chain primarily carbon stored in our own longlived wood products and products that our customers make from our logs our carbon emissions totaled 7 million mtco 2 e in 2020 with just 1 million of that total being our direct and indirect emissions these direct and indirect emissions are primarily attributable to electricity and fuel usage within our wood products mills which speaks to the low carbon intensity of wood products manufacturing the remaining 6 million mtco 2 e are scope 3 emissions primarily generated by customers who purchase our wood fiber and emissions associated with the products and services we buy as companies across our value chain work to reduce their emissions which many of them are already doing or have committed to do we expect our scope 3 emissions to decrease over time additionally in 2021 we set a sciencebased greenhouse gas reduction target that was approved by the science based targets initiative at the most ambitious level in alignment with the paris agreement goal of limiting global warming to 15 degree celsius see further discussion in the “improving air quality” section below 

protecting biodiversity

the forests we manage host hundreds of native vertebrate species including large mammals such as deer elk cougar black bear and bobcat as well as a tremendous diversity of birds reptiles amphibians insects native fish and other aquatic species many of these species prefer different forest age classes and forest structures or other habitat features on the landscape such as riparian areas since our timberlands contain a matrix of forest stand ages along with other special areas we protect around streams and wetlands these forests support a high level of native biodiversity to preserve and protect this balance we regularly conduct biodiversity assessments across our forests as part of our ongoing stewardship and forest management operations these assessments include analyzing species occurrence data and assessing the presence of threatened endangered critically imperiled imperiled and other regionally significant species conducting biodiversity assessments across our land base gives us necessary insights to help design and implement best practices for habitat conservation and species protection throughout the course of our forest management activities these practices include leaving buffers along riparian areas surveying sites for species occurrences prior to harvesting and thinning activities managing for specific habitat using prescribed burns or thinning harvests or refraining from harvesting during certain sensitive times

improving conservation outcomes

ensuring our forests provide habitat features that support atrisk sensitive or threatened and endangered species is a core component of our environmental stewardship we pursue a number of programs to create and preserve critical habitat including partnering on conservation easements and agreements formal habitat conservation plans hcps with the us federal government and mitigation banking conservation easements and other local agreements can assure sustainable forest practices and the longterm stewardship and protection of wildlife habitat biodiversity and recreational access these partnerships can be made with a variety of groups and organizations and they allow natural resource management to continue which helps protect the economic benefits of a working forest hcps are administered under the federal endangered species act and help provide more specific guidance on the protection and enhancement of habitats for threatened and endangered species we currently participate in hcps and other conservation agreements in alabama arkansas florida georgia louisiana maine mississippi new hampshire north carolina oklahoma oregon south carolina vermont and washington authorized through the us clean water act mitigation banking allows us to set aside certain areas of our timberlands to preserve enhance or restore a wetland stream or habitat area to make up for development by another entity in a similar nearby ecosystem mitigation banks are regulated and approved by the us army corps of engineers and a consortium of federal state and local agencies we currently operate 16 mitigation banks and projects primarily in the us south several other projects are in various stages of evaluation and development overall we currently have more than 36 million acres invested in these various conservation programs in our northern southern and western timberlands and we are always looking for new opportunities and partnerships to expand our impact

contributing to clean water

our forests are critical for providing clean water to communities in our watersheds the trees plants and soil absorb rain and snowmelt allowing our forests to capture and slowly release clean water into the many streams rivers and groundwater systems on our lands our sustainable forestry practices help us maintain our forests ability to capture and filter water ensuring our harvesting methods safeguard water quality for people fish and countless other organisms because our forests rely on rainwater to grow our company’s measurable impact on water use is 

weyerhaeuser company  2021 annual report and form 10k 3 

 

limited to our w ood pr oducts manufacturing sites and offices where water is either recycled or treated onsite evaporated while products are drying or delivered to a local publicly  owned treatment facility 

making better energy choices

on average we meet more than 70 percent of our energy needs in our manufacturing facilities from renewable biomass by using what would otherwise be wood waste from mill residuals to create our own energy this approach allows us to reduce our reliance on nonrenewable fossil fuels and purchased electricity we also reduce energy use in our manufacturing facilities by evaluating and implementing efficiency gains such as utilizing more efficient manufacturing equipment and processes between 2016 and 2020 we improved our overall energy efficiency by 3 percent in the first half of 2021 we launched an energy strategy team to focus on increasing energy efficiency at our manufacturing facilities the team is benchmarking energy efficiency across all manufacturing facilities to identify opportunities for improvement and will implement best practices to further our progress beyond reducing our own energy consumption we also offer other energy solutions our timberlands provide an important land base for renewable energy production such as wind and solar power we also supply other mills companies and utilities with woody biomass to be used to produce renewable carbonneutral energy

improving air quality   

between 2000 and 2020 we reduced our total greenhouse gas emissions by 57 percent we achieved these reductions primarily by consolidating operations to higherefficiency mills replacing fossil fuels with carbonneutral biomass fuels and reducing fertilizer use in our timberlands we expect to maintain these gains and further decrease our emissions with the continued installation of new more efficient equipment and by investing in capital projects that decrease our need for fossil fuels and other greenhouse gasemitting sources in 2021 we set and submitted a sciencebased greenhouse gas reduction target to the science based targets initiative at the most ambitious level in alignment with the paris agreement goal of limiting global warming to 15 degree celsius with this very important milestone we’re excited to join a select group of climate leaders who are on a path to net zero emissions our approved target includes a commitment to reduce our scope 1 and 2 emissions by 42 percent overall and our scope 3 emissions by 25 percent per ton of production both by 2030 we expect to achieve these targets primarily through energy efficiency projects increased renewable energy usage and supplier engagement 

minimizing waste   

on average 95 percent of each log that enters our mills is turned into a useful product the primary products we produce are solid lumber wood panels and engineered wood products wood shavings sawdust chips and bark are sold or delivered to downstream customers who make other useful and essential products for society toilet paper diapers paper cartons boxes bags landscaping mulch and wood pellets are just a few of the countless products made from our wood fiber and forest and mill byproducts we are always looking for ways to reduce the amount of waste we generate including finding responsible methods for reuse and recycling on average we reuse recycle or repurpose 99 percent of potential waste in our operations that is equal to approximately 12 billion pounds of material each year that otherwise would have found its way to a landfill

verifying with certification   

to prove our forest management and wood fiber procurement practices are sustainable we participate in independent certification programs for forest management fiber sourcing and chain of custody our entire timberland portfolio is certified to the sustainable forestry initiative® sfi ® forest management standard that compares with only 11 percent of the worlds forests that are certified today the vast majority of these certified forests are in the northern hemisphere internationally recognized forest certification standards such as sfi programme for the endorsement of forest certification pefc tm  the american tree farm system ® atfs and the forest stewardship council ®  provide customers and stakeholders with an objective thirdparty determination of whether companies are implementing sustainable forestry practices and making products that come from legal and wellmanaged sources we are vocal supporters of the importance of these standards and the use of independent thirdparty audits to verify compliance and promote sustainable forestry around the world at weyerhaeuser we choose to certify our timberlands and operations to sfi’s standards because they are strong sciencebased standards that have effectively pushed forestry in a more sustainable direction these standards are designed specifically for operations in north america and we value sfi’s collaborative approach especially around logger training and the requirement to invest in and apply research back into our operations in addition to our forests we certify all of our manufacturing facilities to the sfi fiber sourcing standard and select sites are certified to the sfi and pefc chain of custody standards 

social responsibility

throughout our long history social responsibility has been an integral part of how we do business our company needs diverse talented workers to grow innovate and thrive with us for decades to come because we depend so much on our people we have a responsibility to do everything we can to create a safe inclusive work environment where employees are proud to spend their entire careers we also need strong communities around us filled with people who trust and support our work

what we do

 

this section provides information about how we

 



 

for each of our business segments we provide details about what we do where we do it how much we sell and where we are headed

timberlands

our timberlands segment manages 106 million acres of private commercial timberlands in the us we own 98 million of those acres and control the remaining acres through longterm contracts in addition we have renewable longterm licenses on 141 million acres of canadian timberlands

what we do

forestry management

our timberlands segment

 



weyerhaeuser company  2021 annual report and form 10k 8 

 

 

we seek to maximize the returns from our timberlands by selling delivered logs and through stumpage sales to both internal and external customers we leverage our expertise in forestry using research and planning systems to optimize log production and innovative planting and harvesting techniques across varying terrain we use intensive customized silviculture to increase forest productivity and returns while managing our forests on a sustainable basis we use our scale infrastructure and supply chain expertise to deliver reliable and consistent supply to our customers

competitive factors within each of our market areas generally include price species grade quality proximity to woodconsuming facilities and the ability to consistently meet customer requirements we compete in the marketplace through our ability to provide customers with a consistent and reliable supply of highquality logs at scale volumes and competitive prices our customers also value our status as a sfi certified supplier

sustainable forestry practices

we manage our forests intensively to maximize the value of every acre and produce a sustainable supply of wood fiber for our customers at the same time we are careful to protect biological diversity water quality and other ecosystem values our working forests also provide unique environmental cultural historical and recreational value we work hard to protect these and other qualities while still managing our forests to produce financially mature timber we follow regulatory requirements voluntary standards and certify 100 percent of our north american timberlands under the sfi forest management standard

canadian forestry operations

in canada we manage timberlands under longterm licenses that serve as the primary source of raw material for our manufacturing facilities in various provinces when we harvest trees we pay the provinces at stumpage rates set by the government we transfer logs to our manufacturing facilities at cost and do not generate any significant profit from the harvest of timber from our licensed acres in canada

timberlands products

 



 

how we measure our products

we use multiple units of measure when transacting business including

 



 

we report timberlands volumes in ton equivalents

where we do it

as of december 31 2021 we sustainably managed timberlands in 17 states this included owned or contracted acres in the following locations

 



 

in canada we manage timberlands under longterm licenses that provide raw material for our manufacturing facilities these licenses are in alberta british columbia ontario and saskatchewan

our total timber inventory — including timber on owned and contracted land — is approximately 593 million tons this timber inventory does not translate into a specific amount of lumber or panel products because the quantity of end products varies according to the age species size and quality of the timber and will change over time as these variables adjust

we maintain our timber inventory in an integrated resource inventory system and geographic information system gis the resource inventory component of the system is proprietary and is largely based on internally developed methods including growth and yield models developed by our research and development organization the gis component is based on gis software that is viewed as the standard in our industry

timber inventory data collection and verification techniques include the use of industry standard field sampling procedures as well as proprietary remote sensing technologies in some geographies the data is collected and maintained at the timber stand level

canada — licensed forestlands 

we manage forestlands in canada under longterm licenses from the provincial governments to secure volume for our manufacturing facilities in various provinces the provincial governments regulate the volume of timber that may be harvested each year through annual allowable cuts aac which are updated every 10 years as of december 31 2021 our aac by province was

 



 

when the volume is harvested we pay the province for that volume at stumpage rates set by the government the harvested logs are transferred to our manufacturing facilities at cost stumpage plus harvest haul and overhead costs less any margin on selling logs to third parties any profit from harvesting the log through converting to finished products is recognized at the respective mill in our wood products segment

summary of license arrangements

 



 



how much we harvest

our fee harvest volumes are managed sustainably across all regions to ensure the preservation of longterm economic value of the timber and to capture maximum value from the markets this is accomplished by ensuring annual harvest schedules target financially mature timber and reforestation activities align with the growing of timber through its life cycle to financial maturity

real estate energy and natural resources

our real estate  enr segment maximizes the value of our timberland ownership through application of our asset value optimization avo process and captures the full value of surface and subsurface assets in 2021 we announced the launch of our new natural climate solutions business through which we intend to leverage our resources and expertise to help others meet their goals for reduced carbon emissions this will involve an expansion of our current business activities in the areas of conservation and mitigation banking and leasing land for renewable energy projects in addition we are strategically positioned to participate in two emerging markets focused on the mitigation of carbon emissions the forest carbon offset markets where carbon credits are created through incremental carbon sequestration over a baseline and sold to buyers in need of offset credits and carbon capture and storage which involves leasing of surface and subsurface ownership to safely and permanently store transported carbon emissions from their source as the largest private owner of timberlands in north america the scale and geographic diversity of our assets create a unique opportunity for participation in each of these activities all of which offer natural solutions for reducing carbon emissions and support climate change mitigation efforts

what we do

real estate

properties that exhibit higher use value than commercial timberlands are monetized by our real estate business over time we analyze our existing us timberland holdings using a process we call avo we start with understanding the value of a parcel operating as commercial timberlands and then assess the specific real estate attributes of the parcel and its corresponding market the assessment includes demographics infrastructure and proximity to amenities and recreation to determine the potential to realize a premium value to commercial timberland attributes can evolve over time and accordingly the assignment of value and opportunity can change we continually revisit our avo assessment for all our timberland acres recently we have been focused on developing a nextgeneration process that enhances our ability to identify and capture value from various timber and nontimber attributes including carbon renewable energy and other natural climate solutions opportunities this sophisticated technologyenabled approach referred to as “avo 20” leverages remote sensing satellite imagery machine learning and other advanced data analytics and has generated significant improvements in our ability to identify strategic growth opportunities and manage every acre in our portfolio to maximize value across the full suite of attributes and opportunities

we expect to sell certain properties for recreational conservation commercial or residential purposes over time we will also entitle a small amount of acres to support development development outside of entitlement activities is typically performed by third parties mitigation banking 

weyerhaeuser company  2021 annual report and form 10k 18 

 

allows us to set aside certain areas of our timberlands to preserve enhance or restore a wetland stream or habitat area to make up for development by another entity in a similar nearby ecosystem  activities within this business that contribute to natural climate solutions include land sales to conservation or solar buyers and mitigation banking  some of our real estate activities are conducted through our trss 

occasionally we sell a small amount of timberland acreage in areas where we choose to reduce our market presence and capture a price that exceeds the value derivable from holding and operating as commercial timberlands these transactions will vary based on factors including the location and physical characteristics of the timberlands

the volume of real estate sales is a function of many factors including the general state of the economy demand in local real estate markets the ability of buyers to obtain financing the number of competing properties listed for sale the seasonal nature of sales particularly in the northern states the plans of adjacent landowners our expectation of future price appreciation the timing of harvesting activities and the availability of government and notforprofit funding in any period the average sales price per acre will vary based on the location and physical characteristics of parcels sold

energy and natural resources

we focus on maximizing potential opportunities for construction materials industrial minerals renewable energy including wind and solar energy natural gas rights of way easements on our timberland portfolio and retained mineral interests activities within this business that contribute to natural climate solutions include leasing land for the production of renewable energy like wind and solar as well as forest carbon and carbon capture and storage

as the owner of mineral rights and interests we typically do not invest in development or operations but instead enter into contracts with operators granting them the rights to explore and sell energy and natural resources produced from our property in exchange for rents and royalties 

we generally reserve mineral rights when selling timberlands acreage some energy and natural resources activities are conducted through our trss

natural resource and environmental matters

 

we are subject to a multitude of laws and regulations in the operation of our businesses we also participate in voluntary certification of our timberlands to ensure that we sustain their overall quality including the protection of wildlife and water quality changes in law and regulation or certification standards can significantly affect our business

regulations affecting forestry practices

in the united states regulations established by federal state and local government agencies to protect water quality wetlands and other wildlife habitat could affect future harvests and forest management practices on our timberlands forest practice laws and regulations that affect present or future harvest and forest management activities in certain states include

 



 

each state in which we own timberlands has developed best management practices to reduce the effects of forest practices on water quality and aquatic habitats additional and more stringent regulations may be adopted by various state and local governments to achieve waterquality standards under the federal clean water act protect fish and wildlife habitats human health or achieve other public policy objectives

in canada our forest operations are carried out on public timberlands under forest licenses with the provinces all forest operations in canada are subject to

 



in canada 21 member companies of the forest products association of canada fpac including weyerhaeuser ’ s canadian subsidiary announced in may 2010 the signing of a canadian boreal forest agreement cbfa with nine environmental organizations the cbfa applies to approximately 72 million hectares of public forests licensed to fpac members and when fully implemented was expected to lead to the conservation of significant areas of canada ’ s boreal forest and protection of boreal species at risk in particular woodland caribou while the cbfa mandate came to an end in 2017 cbfa signatories continue to work on management plans with provincial governments and seek the participation of aboriginal and local communities in advancing the goals of the cbfa

endangered species protections

in the united states a number of fish and wildlife species that inhabit geographic areas near or within our timberlands have been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal endangered species act esa or similar state laws including but not limited to

 



additional species or populations may be listed as threatened or endangered as a result of pending or future citizen petitions or petitions initiated by federal or state agencies in addition significant citizen litigation seeks to compel the federal agencies to designate critical habitat for esalisted species and many cases have resulted in settlements under which designations will be implemented over time such designations may adversely affect some management activities and options restrictions on timber harvests can result from

 



such actions could increase our operating costs and affect timber supply and prices in general to date we do not believe that these measures have had and we do not believe that in 2022 they will have a significant effect on our harvesting operations we anticipate that likely future actions will not disproportionately affect weyerhaeuser as compared with comparable operations of us competitors

weyerhaeuser company  2021 annual report and form 10k 25 

 

in canada 

 



the identification and protection of habitat and the implementation of range plans and land use action plans may over time result in additional restrictions on timber harvests and other forest management practices that could increase operating costs for operators of timberlands in canada to date we do not believe that these canadian measures have had and we do not believe that in 2022 they will have a significant effect on our harvesting operations we anticipate that likely future measures will not disproportionately affect weyerhaeuser as compared with similar operations of canadian competitors

forest certification standards

we operate in north america under the sustainable forestry initiative ® sfi this is a certification standard designed to supplement government regulatory programs with voluntary landowner initiatives to further protect certain public resources and values sfi is an independent standard overseen by a governing board consisting of

 



ongoing compliance with sfi may result in some increases in our operating costs and reduction of our timber harvests in some areas there is also competition from other private certification systems primarily the forest stewardship council fsc coupled with efforts by supporters to further those systems by persuading customers of forest products to require products certified to their preferred system certain features of the fsc system could impose additional operating costs on timberland management because of the considerable variation in fsc standards and variability in how those standards are interpreted and applied if sufficient marketplace demand develops for products made from raw materials sourced from other than sficertified forests we could incur substantial additional costs for operations and be required to reduce harvest levels

what these regulations and certification programs mean to us

the regulatory and nonregulatory forest management programs described above have

 



we believe that these regulations and programs have not had and in 2022 will not have a significant effect on our total harvest of timber in the united states or canada however these kinds of programs may have such an effect in the future we expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these programs as compared with typical owners of comparable timberlands we also expect that these programs will not significantly disrupt our planned operations over large areas or for extended periods

canadian aboriginal rights

many of the canadian timberlands are subject to the constitutionally protected treaty or commonlaw rights of aboriginal peoples of canada most of british columbia bc is not covered by treaties and as a result the claims of bc’s aboriginal peoples relating to forest resources have been largely unresolved nonetheless the supreme court of canada ruled that the tsilhqot’in nation holds aboriginal title to approximately 1900 square kilometers in bc the first time the court has declared title to exist based on historical occupation by aboriginal peoples many aboriginal groups continue to be engaged in treaty discussions with the governments of bc other provinces and canada

final or interim resolution of claims brought by aboriginal groups can be expected to result in

 



weyerhaeuser company  2021 annual report and form 10k 26 

 

we believe that such claims will not have a significant effect on our total harvest of timber or production of forest products in 2022  although they may have such an effect in the future 

pollution control regulations

our operations are subject to various federal state provincial and local pollution control laws and regulations

these laws and regulations as well as market demands impose controls with regard to

 



compliance with these laws regulations and demands usually involves capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs we cannot easily quantify the future amounts of capital expenditures we might have to make to comply with these laws regulations and demands or the effects on our operating costs because in some instances compliance standards have not been developed or have not become final or definitive in addition it is difficult to isolate the environmental component of most manufacturing capital projects

our capital projects typically are designed to

 



 

environmental cleanup

we are involved in the environmental investigation or remediation of numerous sites of these sites

 



our liability with respect to these various sites ranges from insignificant to substantial the amount of liability depends on the

 



we spent approximately 8 million in 2021 and expect to spend approximately 4 million in 2022 on environmental remediation of these sites

it is our policy to accrue for environmental remediation costs when we

 



based on currently available information and analysis we believe it is reasonably possible that our costs to remediate all the identified sites may exceed our current accruals of 63 million by up to 126 million this estimate of the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs is much less certain than the estimates we currently are using to determine how much to accrue the estimate of the upper range also relies on assumptions less favorable to us among the range of reasonably possible outcomes

regulation of air emissions in the us

the united states environmental protection agency epa has promulgated regulations for air emissions from

 



these regulations cover

 



weyerhaeuser company  2021 annual report and form 10k 27 

 

the epa has issued several rules relating to mact standards and the emission of greenhouse gases from various energyproducing sources several court decisions have made the extent of applicability of these rules uncertain depending on the final outcomes of these decisions these regulatory programs could affect our operations by increasing the cost of purchasing electricity or from mandated energy demand reductions that could apply to our mills and other facilities that we operate the epa is also expected to issue rules relating to biomass emissions which is a significant source of energy at our mills the effect of these existing and future emissions regulations as well as related court decisions on our operations remains uncertain we continue to track and evaluate the litigation and regulatory developments but are not able to predict whether the regulations when complete and implemented will have a material effect on our operations 

to address concerns about greenhouse gases as a pollutant we

 



additional factors that could affect regulation of greenhouse gas emissions in the future include

 



 

we believe these developments have not had and in 2022 will not have a significant effect on our operations although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations we maintain an active forestry research program to track and understand any potential effect from actual climate change related parameters that could affect the forests we own and manage and do not anticipate any disruptions to our planned operations

regulation of air emissions in canada

our wood products facilities are regulated in canada under provincial air quality rules the canadian federal government has also proposed an air quality management system aqms as a comprehensive national approach for improving air quality in canada to go along with existing provincial air quality regulations the aqms includes

 



 

in addition to these existing and proposed regulations environment and climate change canada a canadian federal agency released the pancanadian framework on clean growth and climate change a greenhouse gas emission framework the framework put in place a national sectorbased greenhouse gas reduction program applicable to a number of industries including ours

all canadian provincial governments

 



along with clean air regulations british columbia a province in which we operate has adopted a carbon tax and alberta where we also have operations has a mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction regulation

although these and related regulations and measures have not had and we do not expect in 2022 that they will have a material effect on our operations they could in the future

regulation of water in the us

our operations are regulated under the clean water act which regulates the discharge of pollutants into the waters of the us this generally means obtaining permits for certain of our silviculture activities and abiding by applicable restrictions federal agency rulemaking and related litigation under the act affects the definition of waterways subject to the act’s regulation this in turn has increased the number of required federal and state permits in some areas of our operations as it relates to the application of pesticides and herbicides on timberlands which has increased operating costs pending and future federal and state rulemaking and judicial challenges thereto could make application of the clean water act as well as comparable state laws more or less costly to weyerhaeuser and we are not able to predict the final resolution of these matters although this and related regulations have not had and we do not expect in 2022 that they will have a material effect on our operations they could in the future

weyerhaeuser company  2021 annual report and form 10k 28 

 

regulation of water in canada 

changes to the canadian federal fisheries act have moved the focus of that legislation from habitat protection to fisheries protection and increased penalties we expect further changes to these regulations but we cannot predict the scope or potential effect if any on our operations although this and related canadian regulations have not had and we do not expect in 2022 that they will have a material effect on our operations they could in the future

potential changes in pollution regulation

state governments in the us continue to promulgate total maximum daily load tmdl requirements for pollutants in water bodies that do not meet state or epa water quality standards state tmdl requirements may set

 



 

moreover some states including at least two in which we operate have adopted or have introduced legislation to adopt humanhealthbased water quality standards these requirements may alter or introduce restrictions on some of our silviculture activities notably the application of pesticides and herbicides to our timberlands in some areas in canada various levels of government have been working to address water issues including use quality and management recent areas of focus include water allocation regional watershed protection protection of drinking water water pricing and a national water quality index

although these developments have not had and we do not expect in 2022 that they will have a material effect on our operations they could in the future

you should consider the following risk factors in addition to the information presented elsewhere in this report particularly in our business  forwardlooking statements and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda  as well as those set forth from time to time in our other public statements reports registration statements prospectuses information statements and other filings we make from time to time with the sec in evaluating us our business and an investment in our securities 

the risks discussed below are not the only risks we face and our descriptions of such risks here and elsewhere should not be considered exhaustive additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely affect our business our financial condition our results of operations our cash flows and the price of our common stock

 

 

risks related to our business and industry

 

 

market and other external risks

the industries in which we operate are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions and consequently are highly cyclical

the overall levels of demand for the products we manufacture and distribute reflect fluctuations in levels of enduser demand which consequently affect our sales and profitability enduser demand depends in large part on general macroeconomic conditions both in the us and globally as well as on local economic conditions the length and magnitude of industry cycles vary over time both by market and by product but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions and levels of industry capacity any decline or stagnation in macroeconomic conditions could cause us to experience lower sales volume and reduced margins for our products

low demand for new homes and home repair and remodeling can adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows

our business is particularly dependent upon the health of the us housing market and specifically on demand for new homes and home repair and remodeling demand in these markets is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as the level of employment consumer confidence consumer income the availability of financing and interest rate levels other factors that could limit or adversely affect demand for new homes and home repair and remodeling and hence demand for our products include factors such as changes in consumer preferences limited wage growth increases in nonmortgage consumer debt any weakening in consumer confidence as well as any increase in foreclosure rates and distress sales of houses

catastrophic events may adversely affect the markets for our products and our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

we are subject to the risk of various catastrophic events including but not limited to the occurrence of significant fires or widespread insect or pest infestations on one or more of our properties severe regional or local weather events or trends flooding major earthquakes volcanic eruptions significant geopolitical conditions or developments such as significant international trade disputes terrorist attacks armed conflict domestic political unrest and regional health epidemics or global health pandemics any one or more of these events or conditions or other catastrophic events or developments could significantly affect our ability to operate our businesses and adversely affect domestic and global general economic conditions and thus market demand for our products 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus “covid19” a global pandemic in response federal state and local governments in the united states as well as governments throughout the world declared states of emergency and ordered preventative measures to contain and mitigate the spread of the virus these measures which have included stay home and similar mandates for individuals and closure or significant curtailment of many businesses have caused significant economic disruption and uncertainty as well as disruption and volatility in global capital markets as a result there have been periodic adverse effects on our and our contractors’ ability to operate the demand for our timber and wood products and disruptions to our supply chain and the manufacturing distribution and export of our timber and wood products all of which could worsen in the future any one or more of these consequences of covid19 as well as other unpredictable events could materially adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition the covid19 outbreak continues to rapidly evolve with periods of improvement followed by periods of higher infection rates along with the development of new disease variants such as the delta and omicron variants in various geographical areas throughout the world the extent to which covid19 may further affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition as well as our plans and decisions relating to various capital expenditures other discretionary items and capital allocation priorities including the timing and amount of our dividends to shareholders are therefore highly uncertain and will depend on future developments which cannot be predicted with confidence such developments include but are not limited to the future rate of occurrence or further mutation of covid19 or the outbreak of another virulent disease continuation of or changes in governmental responses to disease outbreak including without limitation the impact of any future vaccine mandates and testing requirements and employee and company contractor responses to such mandates and requirements the duration of disease outbreak and 

weyerhaeuser company  2021 annual report and form 10k 31 

 

consequential restrictions and business disruptions the effectiveness of responsive government actions to contain and manage the disease and the timing and effectiveness of treatment and testing options including the ongoing efficacy and availability of vaccines  

the impacts of the covid19 outbreak and related restrictions have led to significant periodic increases in national unemployment since the outset of the pandemic an extended continuation or worsening of domestic unemployment may adversely affect demand for our products and thus negatively impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition the us has experienced elevated inflation in recent months at least in part driven by the impacts of the pandemic if inflation continues or worsens it could negatively impact demand for our products or it could increase our costs and we may not be able to fully pass the increased costs to customers the impact of covid19 or other virulent disease may also trigger the occurrence or exacerbate other risks discussed herein any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for more discussion on the current effects of covid19 on our business and operations see our discussion under management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda – economic and market conditions affecting our operations  

homebuyers’ ability to qualify for and obtain affordable mortgages could be affected by changes in interest rates changes in home loan underwriting standards and government sponsored entities and private mortgage insurance companies supporting the mortgage market

access to affordable mortgage financing is critical to the health of the us housing market generally increases in interest rates make it more difficult for home buyers to obtain mortgage financing which could negatively affect demand for housing and in turn negatively affect demand for our wood products interest rates have remained at historically low levels for an extended period of time although the us federal reserve has made both upward and downward adjustments in recent years we cannot predict the timing number extent or direction of future rate adjustments

along with prevailing interest rates other significant factors affecting the demand for new homes relate to the ability of home buyers to obtain mortgage financing during the last us recession credit requirements for home lending were severely tightened and the number of mortgage loans available for financing home purchases were thereby severely reduced although the availability of credit has improved since that time the housing market could be limited or adversely affected if credit requirements were to again tighten or become more restrictive for any reason

additionally the liquidity provided to the mortgage industry by fannie mae and freddie mac both of which purchase home mortgages and mortgagebacked securities originated by mortgage lenders has been critical to the home lending market any political or other developments that would have the effect of limiting or restricting the availability of financing by these government sponsored entities could also adversely affect interest rates and the availability of mortgage financing whether resulting from direct increases in borrowing rates tightened underwriting standards on mortgage loans or reduced federal support of the mortgage lending industry a challenging mortgage financing environment could reduce demand for housing and therefore adversely affect demand for our products

changes in regulations relating to tax deductions for mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes could harm our future sales and earnings

significant costs of homeownership include mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes both of which are generally deductible for an individual’s federal and in some cases state income taxes recent federal legislation reduced the amount of mortgage interest and real estate taxes that certain taxpayers may deduct these and any similar changes to income tax laws by the federal government or by a state government to eliminate or substantially reduce these income tax deductions or any significant increase in real property taxes by local governments may increase the cost of homeownership and thus could adversely affect the demand for our products

product pricing and profitability

our profitability is affected by market dynamics outside of our control

because commodity products have few distinguishing properties from producer to producer competition for these products is based primarily on price which is determined by supply relative to demand and competition from substitute products prices for our products are also affected by many other factors outside of our control as a result we have little influence or control over the timing and extent of price changes which often are volatile in our industry moreover our profit margins with respect to these products depend in part on managing our costs particularly raw material labor including contract labor and energy costs which represent significant cost components that also fluctuate based upon market and other factors beyond our control 

excess supply of logs and wood products may adversely affect prices and margins

producers in our industry have in the past put downward pressure on product pricing by selling excess supply into the market our industry may increase harvest levels which could lead to an oversupply of logs wood products producers may likewise expand manufacturing capacity which could lead to an oversupply of manufactured wood products any such increases of industry supply to our markets could adversely affect our prices and margins

thirdparty service providers

we depend heavily on third parties for logging and transportation services and any increase in the cost or any disruption in the availability of these services could materially adversely affect our business and operations and our financial results

our businesses depend heavily on the availability of thirdparty service providers for the harvest of our timber and the transportation of our wood products and wood fiber we are therefore considerably affected by the availability and cost of these services any significant increase in the operating costs to our service providers including without limitation an increase in the cost of fuel or labor could have a material negative effect 

weyerhaeuser company  2021 annual report and form 10k 32 

 

on our financial results by increasing the cost of these services to us as well as result in an overall reduction in the availability of these services altogether 

our thirdparty transportation providers are also subject to several events outside of their control such as disruption of transportation infrastructure labor issues including shortages of commercial truck drivers and natural disasters any failure of a thirdparty transportation provider to timely deliver our products including delivery of our wood products and wood fiber to our customers and delivery of wood fiber to our mills could harm our supply chain negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and our reputation

as a result of weak business conditions in the timber industry that persisted for several years there are fewer thirdparty service providers in certain markets to harvest and deliver our logs this shortage has resulted in an overall increase in logging and hauling costs and in some cases compromised the general availability of these contractors any increase in harvest levels due to positive changes in macroeconomic conditions driving demand for logs could further strain the existing supply of thirdparty logging and hauling service providers this in turn could increase the cost of log supply and delivery or prevent us from fully capitalizing on favorable market conditions by limiting our ability to access and deliver our logs to market

managing commercial timberlands risks

our ability to harvest and deliver timber may be subject to limitations which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows

our primary assets are our timberlands weather conditions timber growth cycles access limitations and availability of contract loggers and haulers may adversely affect our ability to harvest our timberlands other factors that may adversely affect our timber harvest include damage to our standing timber by fire or by insect or pest infestation disease prolonged drought flooding severe weather and other natural disasters as discussed in more detail in the following risk factors changes in global climate conditions could intensify the severity and rate of occurrence of any one or more of these risks that we currently face or introduce other risks that we currently cannot predict although damage from such causes usually is localized and affects only a limited percentage of standing timber there can be no assurance that any damage affecting our timberlands will in fact be limited as is common in the forest products industry we do not maintain insurance coverage for damage to our timberlands our revenues net income and cash flow from operations are dependent to a significant extent on the pricing of our products and our continued ability to harvest timber at adequate levels therefore if we were to be restricted from harvesting on a significant portion of our timberlands for a prolonged period of time or if material damage to a significant portion of our standing timber were to occur we could suffer materially adverse effects to our results of operations and cash flows

future timber harvest levels may also be affected by our ability to timely and effectively replant harvested areas which depends on several factors including changes in estimates of longterm sustainable yield because of silvicultural advances natural disasters fires pests insects and other hazards regulatory constraints availability of contractors us immigration policies and other factors beyond our control

timber harvest activities are also subject to a number of federal state and local regulations pertaining to the protection of fish wildlife water and other resources regulations government agency policy and guidelines and litigation can restrict timber harvest activities and increase costs examples include federal and state laws protecting threatened endangered and “atrisk” species harvesting and forestry road building activities that may be restricted under the us federal clean water act state forestry practices laws laws protecting aboriginal rights and other similar regulations

our estimates of timber inventories and growth rates may be inaccurate and include risks inherent in calculating such estimates which may impair our ability to realize expected revenues

whether in connection with managing our existing timberland portfolio or assessing potential timberland acquisitions we make and rely on important estimates of merchantable timber inventories these include estimates of timber inventories that may be lawfully and economically harvested timber growth rates and endproduct yields timber growth rates and yield estimates are developed by forest biometricians and other experts using statistical measurements of tree samples on given property these estimates are central to forecasting our anticipated timber harvests revenues and expected cash flows while the company has confidence in its timber inventory processes and the professionals in the field who administer it future growth and yield estimates are inherently inexact and uncertain and subject to many external variables that could further affect their accuracy these external variables include among other things disease insect or pest infestation natural disasters and changes in weather patterns if these estimates are inaccurate our ability to manage our timberlands in a sustainable or profitable manner may be compromised which may cause our results of operations cash flows and our stock price to be adversely affected

our operating results and cash flows will be materially affected by supply and demand for timber

a variety of factors affect prices for timber including available supply changes in economic conditions that affect demand the level of domestic new construction and remodeling activity interest rates credit availability population growth weather conditions and insect or pest infestation and other factors these factors vary by region by timber type ie sawlogs or pulpwood logs and by species

timber prices are affected by changes in demand on a local national and international level the closure of a mill in a region where we own timber could have a material adverse effect on demand in that region and therefore pricing for example as the demand for paper continues to decline closures of pulp mills in some of our operating regions have adversely affected the regional demand for pulpwood and wood chips additionally some of our asian log export markets particularly china have a history of significant volatility lower demand for our export logs could have a negative effect on timber prices particularly in the western region

timber prices are also affected by changes in timber supply and availability at the local national and international level our timberland ownership is concentrated in alabama arkansas louisiana mississippi north carolina oklahoma oregon and washington in some of these 

weyerhaeuser company  2021 annual report and form 10k 33 

 

states much of the timberland is privately owned increases in timber prices often result in substantial increases in harvesting on private timberlands including lands owned by others and not previously made available for commercial timber operations causing a shortterm increase in supply that moderates such price increases in western states such as oregon and washington where a greater proportion of timberland is governmentowned any substantial increase in timber harvesting from governmentowned land could significantly reduce timber prices on a local level timber supplies can fluctuate depending on factors such as changes in weather conditions and harvest strategies of local timberland owners as well as occasionally high timber salvage efforts due to events such as insect or pest infestations fires or other natural disasters demand for timber in foreign markets can fluctuate due to a variety of factors as well including but not limited to changes in the fundamental economic conditions that affect demand for logs in a given export market country or region any substantial increase in supply of logs from local or regional sources including such sources that periodically supply large amounts of salvage timber as a result of disease or infestation and other factors 

timberlands make up a significant portion of our business portfolio and we are therefore subject to real estate investment risks

our real property holdings are primarily timberlands and we may make additional timberlands acquisitions in the future as the owner and manager of approximately 11 million acres of timberlands we are subject to the risks that are inherent in concentrated real estate investments a downturn in the real estate industry generally or the timber or forest products industries specifically could reduce the value of our properties and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows such a downturn could also adversely affect our customers and reduce the demand for our products as well as our ability to execute upon our strategy of selling nonstrategic timberlands and timberland properties that have higher and better uses at attractive prices these risks may be more pronounced than if we diversified our investments outside of real property holdings 

manufacturing and selling wood products risks

a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales and negatively affect our results of operation and financial condition

any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including  

 



 

we cannot predict the duration of any such downtime or extent of facility damage if one of our facilities or machines were to incur significant downtime our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer demand could be impaired resulting in lower sales and income additionally we may be required to make significant unplanned capital expenditures although some risks are not insurable and some coverage is limited we purchase insurance on our manufacturing facilities for damage from fires floods windstorms earthquakes other severe weather conditions equipment failures and boiler explosions such insurance may not be sufficient to recover all of our damages

some of our wood products are vulnerable to declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials

our products compete with nonfiber based alternatives or with alternative products in certain market segments for example plastic woodplastic or composite materials may be used by builders as alternatives to our wood products such as lumber veneer plywood and oriented strand board changes in prices for oil chemicals and woodbased fiber can change the competitive position of our products relative to available alternatives and could increase substitution of those products for our products if use of these or other alternative products grows demand for and pricing of our products could be adversely affected  

our results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by changes in product mix or pricing

our results may be materially adversely affected by a change in our product mix or pricing some of our wood products such as lumber veneer plywood and oriented strand board are commodities and are subject to fluctuations in market pricing if pricing on our commodity products decreases and if we are not successful in increasing sales of higherpriced highervalue products or if we are not successful in implementing price increases or there are delays in acceptance of price increases or higherpriced products our results of operations cash flows and financial 

weyerhaeuser company  2021 annual report and form 10k 34 

 

condition could be materially and adversely affected price discounting if required to maintain our competitive position in one or more markets could result in lower than anticipated price realizations and margins 

we face intense competition in our markets any failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

we compete with north american producers and for some of our product lines global producers some of which may have greater financial resources and lower production costs than we do the principal basis for competition for many of our products is selling price our industries also are particularly sensitive to other factors including innovation design quality and service with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line to the extent that any of our competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor our ability to attract and retain customers and maintain and increase sales could be materially adversely affected any failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

competition from lumber imports could vary significantly and have a material effect on us lumber and timber prices

the future amount and pricing of lumber imports entering us markets remain uncertain historically canada has been the most significant source of lumber for the us market particularly in the new home construction market we produce lumber in our canadian mills but the bulk of our lumber production is in the us there have been many disputes and subsequent trade agreements regarding sales of softwood lumber between canada and the us the last agreement which required canadian softwood lumber facilities including our mills to pay an export tax when the price of lumber is at or below a threshold price expired in october 2015 since that time the us department of commerce has issued countervailing and antidumping duties on softwood lumber imports from canada based on findings of injury to us lumber producers

we are not able to predict when or if a new softwood lumber agreement will be reached or if reached what the terms of the agreement would be similarly we are not able to predict if the current us policy of imposing import duties on canadian softwood lumber will continue we could therefore experience significant downward pressure on timber and lumber prices caused by canadian lumber imports

customer demand for certain brands of sustainablyproduced products could reduce competition among buyers for our products or cause other adverse effects

we have adopted the sustainable forestry initiative® sfi ® standard for wood fiber supplied to our manufacturing facilities both from our timberlands and from thirdparty suppliers if customer preference for a sustainability standard other than sfi   increases or if the sfi   standard falls into disfavor  there may be reduced demand and lower prices for our products relative to competitors who can supply products sourced from forests certified to competing certification standards if we seek to comply with such other standards we could incur materially increased costs for our operations or be required to modify our operations such as reducing harvest levels fsc in particular employs standards that are geographically variable and could cause a material reduction in the harvest levels of some of our timberlands most notably in the pacific northwest

our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials and energy

we rely heavily on certain raw materials principally wood fiber and chemicals and energy sources principally natural gas electricity and fuel oil in our manufacturing processes our ability to increase earnings has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials and energy sources we may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material or energy costs through price increases productivity improvements costreduction programs or hedging arrangements in addition the us has experienced elevated inflation in recent months at least in part driven by impacts of the pandemic if inflation continues or worsens it could negatively impact the cost or availability of raw materials and energy and we may not be able to fully pass the increased costs to customers

physical risks related to climate change

changes in global or regional climate conditions could significantly harm our timberland assets and have a negative impact on our results of operations cash flow and profitability of our operations

climate change has the potential to cause significant disruptions to our business and results of operations cash flow and profitability there is increasing concern that increases in global average temperatures caused by increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could cause significant changes in weather patterns including changes to precipitation patterns and growing seasons these changes could in the long term and in some locations lead to slower growth of our trees and potentially changes to the species mix that we manage in our timber assets an increase in global temperature could also lead to an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and other natural disasters thus damage or access to our timberland assets by existing causes such as fire insect or pest infestation disease prolonged drought flooding windstorms and other natural disasters could be significantly worsened by climate change any one or more of these negative effects on commercial timberland operations from climate change both our own and that of other commercial timberland operators could also have a material adverse impact on our wood products business by significantly affecting the availability cost and quality of the wood fiber used in our mill operations

workforce risk

our business is dependent upon attracting retaining and developing key personnel

our   success depends to a significant extent upon our ability to attract retain and develop senior management operations management and other key personnel our financial condition or results of operations could be significantly adversely affected if we were to fail to recruit retain and develop such personnel or if there were to occur any significant decrease in the availability of such personnel or any significant increase in the cost of providing such personnel with competitive total compensation and benefits in addition in recent months we have observed an overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market a sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base whether 

weyerhaeuser company  2021 annual report and form 10k 35 

 

caused by covid19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors could lead to increased costs such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees further if we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a high level our operations could be disrupted  

a strike or other work stoppage or our inability to renew collective bargaining agreements on favorable terms could adversely affect our financial results

as of december 31 2021 a significant number of employees in our western timberlands and wood products businesses were covered by collective bargaining agreements if these workers were to engage in a protracted strike or other work stoppage or if our nonunionized operations were to become unionized we could experience a significant disruption of operations at our facilities or higher ongoing labor costs a significant customer or supplier strike or other work stoppage could also have similar effects on us

pension plan liability risk

investment returns on our pension assets may be lower than expected or interest rates may decline requiring us to make significant additional cash contributions to our benefit plans

a portion of our current and former employees have accrued benefits under our defined benefit pension plans although the plans are not open to employees hired on or after january 1 2014 current employees hired before that time continue to accrue benefits requirements for funding our pension plan liabilities are based on a number of actuarial assumptions including the expected rate of return on our plan assets and the discount rate applied to our pension plan obligations fluctuations in equity market returns and changes in longterm interest rates could increase our costs under our defined benefit pension plans and may significantly affect future contribution requirements it is unknown what the actual investment return on our pension assets will be in future years and what interest rates may be at any given point in time we cannot therefore provide any assurance of what our actual pension plan costs will be in the future or whether we will be required under applicable law to make future material plan contributions see note 9 pension and other postemployment benefit plans for additional information about these plans including funding status 

strategic initiatives and execution risk

our business and financial results may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully execute on important strategic initiatives

our strategic initiatives are designed to improve our results of operations and drive longterm shareholder value these initiatives include among others optimizing cash flow through operational excellence reducing costs to achieve industryleading cost structure innovating in highermargin products and pursuing opportunities in emerging markets such as our recently announced initiative to participate in markets for carbon offsets and carbon storage there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement any one or more of our important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations which could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial results

we may be unsuccessful in carrying out our acquisition strategy

we intend to strategically pursue acquisitions and strategic divestitures when market conditions warrant as with any investment our acquisitions may not perform in accordance with our expectations in addition we anticipate financing such acquisitions through cash from operations borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities proceeds from equity or debt offerings or proceeds from strategic asset dispositions or any combination thereof our inability to finance future acquisitions on favorable terms or at all could adversely affect our ability to successfully execute strategic acquisitions and thereby adversely affect our results of operations 

foreign currency risk

we will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates

we have manufacturing operations in canada we are also an exporter and compete with global producers of products very similar to ours therefore we are affected by changes in the strength of the us dollar particularly relative to the canadian dollar euro yuan and yen and the strength of the euro relative to the yen changes in exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our sales volume margins and results of operations

 

 

legal regulatory and tax risks

 

environmental laws and regulations

we could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with violations of or liabilities under applicable environmental laws and other laws and regulations

we are subject to a wide range of general and industryspecific laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing  

 



weyerhaeuser company  2021 annual report and form 10k 36 

 



 

we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations and as a result of remedial obligations   and there can be no assurances that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future costs we also could incur substantial costs such as civil or criminal fines sanctions and enforcement actions including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions cleanup and closure costs and thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations

as the owner and operator of real estate we may be liable under environmental laws for cleanup closure and other damages resulting from the presence and release of hazardous substances on or from our properties or operations in addition surface water management regulations may present liabilities and are subject to change the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict and in some cases our liability may exceed forecasted amounts or the value of the property itself the discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at our sites or thirdparty sites may result in significant additional costs

we also lease some of our properties to thirdparty operators for the purpose of exploring extracting developing and producing oil gas rock and other minerals in exchange for fees and royalty payments these activities are also subject to federal state and local laws and regulations these operations may create risk of environmental liabilities for any unlawful discharge of oil gas or other chemicals into the air soil or water generally these thirdparty operators indemnify us against any such liability and we require that that they maintain liability insurance during the term of our lease with them however if for any reason our thirdparty operators are not able to honor their indemnity obligation or if the required liability insurance were not in effect then it is possible that we could be deemed responsible for costs associated with   environmental liability caused by such thirdparty operators

any material liability we incur as a result of activities conducted on our properties by us or by others with whom we have a business relationship could adversely affect our financial condition

we also anticipate public policy developments at the state federal and international level regarding climate change and energy access security and competitiveness as discussed below we expect these developments to address emission of carbon dioxide renewable energy and fuel standards and the monetization of carbon these developments may also include mandated changes to energy use and building codes which could affect homebuilding practices enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretation of these laws or regulations might require significant expenditures we also anticipate public policy developments at the state federal and international level regarding taxes and a number of other areas that could require significant expenditures

legal and regulatory risks related to climate change

governmental response to climate change at the international federal and state levels may affect our results of operations cash flows and profitability

there continue to be numerous international us federal and statelevel initiatives and proposals to address domestic and global climate issues within the us and canada some of these proposals would regulate and in some canadian provinces do regulate andor tax the production of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to facilitate the reduction of carbon compound emissions into the atmosphere and provide tax and other incentives to produce and use cleaner energy climate change effects if they occur and governmental initiatives laws and regulations to address potential climate concerns could increase our costs and have a longterm adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations future legislation or regulatory activity in this area remains uncertain and its effect on our operations is unclear at this time 

however climate change legislation or related government mandates standards or regulations intended to mitigate or reduce carbon compound greenhouse gas emissions or other climate change effects could have significant adverse effects on our business and operations as well as our ability to achieve our recently announced business goals in emerging carbon offset and carbon storage markets any one or more of such new legal requirements and regulations could for example significantly increase the costs for our mills to comply with stricter air emissions regulations they could also limit harvest levels for commercial timberland operators which could in turn adversely affect our timberland operations as well as potentially lead to significant increases in the cost of energy wood fiber and other raw materials for our wood products businesses any one or more of these developments as well as other unforeseeable governmental responses to climate change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and profitability

legal matters

we are involved in various environmental regulatory product liability and other legal matters disputes and proceedings that if determined or concluded in a manner adverse to our interests could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition

we are from time to time involved in a number of legal matters disputes and proceedings legal matters some of which involve ongoing litigation these include without limitation legal matters involving environmental cleanup and remediation warranty and nonwarranty product 

weyerhaeuser company  2021 annual report and form 10k 37 

 

liability claims regulatory issues contractual and personal injury claims and other legal matters in some cases all or a portion of any loss we experience in connection with any such legal matters will be covered by insurance in other cases any such losses will not be covered 

the outcome costs and other effects of current legal matters in which we are involved and any related insurance recoveries cannot be determined with certainty although the disclosures in note 14 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies and note 20 income taxes contain management ’ s current views of the effect such legal matters could have on our financial results there can be no assurance that the outcome of such legal matters will be as currently expected it is possible that there could be adverse judgments against us in some or all major litigation matters against us and that we could be required to take a charge and make cash payments for all or a portion of any related awards of damages any one or more of such charges or cash payment could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows for the quarter or year in which we record or pay it

reit status and tax implications

if we fail to remain qualified as a reit our taxable income would be subject to tax at corporate rates and we would not be able to deduct dividends to shareholders

in any taxable year in which we fail to qualify as a reit unless we are entitled to relief under the internal revenue code  

 



 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code to our operations and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions we closely monitor our compliance with all of the various requirements for maintaining our reit status for example we regularly test our compliance with the general requirement that at least 75 percent of the market value of our total assets consist of reitqualifying interests in real property such as timberlands and certain other specified qualifying assets and that no more than 25 percent of the market value of our total assets may consist of assets that are not reitqualifying assets although we operate in a manner consistent with these reit qualification rules we cannot provide assurance that we are or will remain qualified

certain of our business activities are subject to corporatelevel income tax and potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax

under the internal revenue code reits generally must engage in the ownership and management of income producing real estate for the company this generally includes owning and managing a timberland portfolio for the production and sale of standing timber certain activities that generate nonqualifying reit income could constitute “prohibited transactions” prohibited transactions are defined by the internal revenue code generally to be sales or other dispositions of property to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business accordingly the harvesting and sale of logs the development or sale of certain timberlands and other real estate and the manufacture and sale of wood products are conducted through one or more of our whollyowned trss the net income of which is subject to corporatelevel tax by conducting our business in this manner we believe that we satisfy the reit requirements of the internal revenue code however if the internal revenue service irs were to successfully assert that these or any of our activities conducted at the reit constituted prohibited transactions we could be subject to the 100 percent tax on the net income from such activities

the extent of our use of our trss may affect our reit qualification and affect the price of our common shares relative to the share price of other reits

we conduct a significant portion of our business activities through one or more trss the use of our trss enables us to engage in nonreit qualifying business activities such as the harvesting and sale of logs manufacture and sale of wood products and the development and sale of certain higher and better use hbu property our trss are subject to corporatelevel income tax under the code no more than 20 percent of the value of the gross assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss this limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our trss’ operations while we intend to monitor the value of our investments in the stock and securities of our trss to ensure compliance with the 20 percent limitation we cannot provide assurance that we will always be able to comply with the limitation so as to maintain reit status if we were to exceed the 20 percent limitation we may be forced to sell or otherwise distribute assets of our trss in order to remain a qualified reit furthermore our use of trss may cause the market to value our common shares differently than the shares of other reits which may not use trss at all or as extensively as we use them

the failure of our subsidiary reit to maintain its separate reit qualification could affect the company’s own reit qualification

a significant amount of our timberlands is held in a subsidiary that we believe qualifies as a reit and we may in the future invest in other timberlands and other real estate through one or more other subsidiary entities that are intended to qualify as reits while our ownership interest in the subsidiary reit is a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the company’s 75 percent asset test described above any failure of the subsidiary reit to maintain its own separate reit status would generally result in the subsidiary being subject to regular us corporate income tax as described above and the company’s ownership interest in the subsidiary no longer qualifying as a real estate asset for purposes of the 75 percent asset test if this were to occur the company’s own reit qualification could be affected

we may be limited in our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our trss

the ability of the company to receive dividends from our trss is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a reit in particular at least 75 percent of gross income for each taxable year as a reit must be derived from real estate sources including sales of our standing timber and other types of qualifying real estate income and no more than 25 percent of our gross income may consist of dividends from our trss and other nonreal estate income this limitation on our ability to receive dividends from our trss may affect our ability 

weyerhaeuser company  2021 annual report and form 10k 38 

 

to fund cash distributions to our shareholders using cash flows from our trss the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed and income of our trss that is not distributed to the company will not be subject to the reit income distribution requirement 

to maintain our qualification as a reit and to avoid an excise tax we are generally required to distribute substantially all of our taxable income to our shareholders

generally reits are required to distribute 90 percent of their ordinary taxable income and to avoid an excise tax 95 percent of their net capital gains income capital gains may be retained by the reit but would be subject to corporate income taxes if capital gains were retained rather than distributed our shareholders would be deemed to have received a taxable distribution about which we would notify them with a credit or refund for any federal income tax paid by the company we believe that we are not required to distribute material amounts of cash since substantially all of our taxable income is treated as capital gains income as previously discussed in these risk factors our board of directors in its sole discretion determines the amount timing and frequency of our dividends to shareholders

changes in tax laws or their interpretation could adversely affect our shareholders and our results of operations

federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process the irs the united states department of the treasury and state taxing authorities changes to tax laws could adversely affect our shareholders or increase our effective tax rates we cannot predict with certainty whether when in what forms or with what effective dates the tax laws applicable to us or our shareholders may be changed

importexport taxes and duties

we may be required to pay significant taxes or tariffs on our exported products or countervailing and antidumping duties or tariffs on our imported products

we export logs and finished wood products to foreign markets and our ability to do so profitably is affected by us and foreign trade policy international trade disputes occur frequently and can be taken to an international trade court for resolution of unfair trade practices between countries

us international trade policy could result in one or more of our foreign export market jurisdictions adopting trade policy making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries we could therefore experience reduced revenues and margins in any of our businesses that is adversely affected by international trade tariffs duties taxes customs or dispute settlement terms to the extent such trade policies increase prices they could also reduce the demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial results and financial condition including facility closures or impairments of assets we cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any settlements of international trade disputes and their effect on our business

economic and market conditions affecting our operations

 

overview

 

in march 2020 covid19 was officially declared a global pandemic by the world health organization and a national emergency was declared by the united states the immediate economic effects of the pandemic were severe as us gross domestic product gdp declined 31 percent in the second quarter of 2020 and the national unemployment rate soared to a recordhigh of nearly 15 percent in april 2020 driven by the restrictions imposed in response to the pandemic since that time the unemployment rate has fallen steadily and us gdp has rebounded significantly as states have continued to reopen their economies and loosen restrictions although market conditions across our businesses deteriorated rapidly in late first quarter and early second quarter 2020 they quickly rebounded as demand for housing and wood products proved resilient growth in repair and remodel demand and new residential construction activity resulted in increased demand for wood products as a result benchmark prices rose to record levels through may 2021 for most lumber products and into early july for oriented strand board osb during the second quarter lumber prices followed by osb began a substantial correction as demand from the repair and remodel segment lessened during the summer months later in the third quarter prices bottomed and began to rebound and increased well above historical norms again by the end of 2021 looking ahead to 2022 our market conditions and the strength of the broader us economy will continue to be influenced by the trajectory of us housing activity repair and remodel activity impacts from covidrelated restrictions inflation trends interest rates and the nature and extent of future government stimulus including the recentlypassed infrastructure investment and jobs act

we have taken proactive steps to safeguard the health of our employees and preserve business continuity from the beginning of the pandemic these actions have included detailed cleaning and disinfecting procedures strict processes around masking social distancing and personal hygiene clear communication with our employees contractors vendors and visitors about our safety protocols comprehensive guidance for response to any covid19 diagnoses or exposures in our operations and a directive that employees work from home if feasible in light of adjustments to federal state and local health and safety restrictions we began a phasedin approach to return some of our employees who have been working from home back to their work locations we remain vigilant about employee safety and will continue to monitor developments including but not limited to the spread of disease variants and their impact on local health systems 

business outlook

 

the demand for sawlogs within our timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of woodbased building products the strength of the us housing market especially new residential construction strongly affects demand in our wood products segment as does repair and remodeling activity seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the us which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products in the fourth quarter of 2021 weather conditions were favorable for harvest operations in the us south our timberlands segment specifically the western region is also affected by export demand and trade policy japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in japan the demand for pulpwood from our timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp paper and osb as well as the demand for biofuels such as pellets made from pulpwood the timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber in general western log markets are highly tensioned while southern log markets have more available supply however additional mill capacity being added in the us south has led to tightening of markets in certain geographies 

on a seasonally adjusted annual basis as reported by the us census bureau housing starts for fourth quarter 2021 averaged 1644 million units a 53 percent increase from third quarter 2021 single family starts averaged 1148 million units and multifamily starts averaged 496 

weyerhaeuser company  2021 annual report and form 10k 43 

 

thousand units in fourth quarter 2021 which represented increases of 47 percent and 65 percent from the third quarter respectively total housing starts of 1595 million in 2021 were up 156 percent from 2020 sales of newly built single family homes averaged a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 728 thousand units for fourth quarter 2021 which is an increase of 42 percent from the third quarter the continued strength of the housing market has been driven by low inventory underlying demographic fundamentals and low mortgage rates builders have struggled to keep pace due to material shortages and other constraints which has contributed to a growing backlog of construction activity 

 

repair and remodeling expenditures increased by 58 percent from third quarter to fourth quarter 2021 and increased by 135 percent for the full year compared to 2020 according to the census bureau advance retail spending report a rebound in doityourself activity and continued strength in projects undertaken by professional contractors contributed to higher sales in the sector 

 

in us wood product markets demand was steady during most of fourth quarter 2021 as dealer inventories remained tight in the second half of the fourth quarter lumber and osb prices rebounded sharply from lows in the third quarter in addition to steady demand floods in british columbia contributed to the increase in prices the random lengths framing lumber composite price averaged 691mbf and the osb composite averaged 624msf in fourth quarter 2021

 

western log markets have shown continued strength in response to the increase in lumber prices and limited log supply douglas fir sawlog prices increased by 4 percent in fourth quarter 2021 compared with third quarter 2021 as reported by risi log lines the strength in western log prices was supported by multiple factors including continued demand in export markets in the south sawlog prices increased by 1 percent from third quarter 2021 and 10 percent from fourth quarter 2020 as reported by timbermartsouth while weather events contributed to some of this increase transportation constraints and additional mill demand also contributed to more tensioned log markets

 

exchange rates available supply from other countries and trade policy affect our export businesses during fourth quarter 2021 continued disruptions in global shipping diversion of european log and lumber supply to other markets and bans on australian log imports to china generally had a positive impact on china’s demand for logs imported from the us in japan total housing starts increased 51 percent year to date through november compared to the same period in 2020 while the key post and beam segment saw an 89 percent increase decreased redwood lumber imports from europe to japan have continued to be favorable to our japanese log export business

 

inflation affects our business especially in increased costs for materials and labor although there are also offsetting impacts including wood product prices and timberland’s effectiveness as an inflation hedge over the last twelve months the consumer price index cpi increased by 70 percent while the producer price index final demand increased by 97 percent 

 

governments and businesses across the globe are taking action on climate change and are making significant commitments towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero achieving these commitments will require governments and companies to take major steps to modify operations invest in lowcarbon activities and purchase offsets to reduce environmental impacts we believe we are uniquely positioned to help entities achieve these commitments through natural climate solutions including forest carbon sequestration and carbon capture and storage activities

see note 14 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies  

 

 

 

accounting matters

 

 

critical accounting policies

in the preparation of our financial statements we follow established accounting policies and make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets liabilities revenues and expenses some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position are considered critical accounting policies

in accounting we base our judgments and estimates on

 



actual results however may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded

our most critical accounting policies relate to our

 



 

details about our other significant accounting policies — what we use and how we estimate — are in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  

weyerhaeuser company  2021 annual report and form 10k 53 

 

discount rates for pension and post employment benefit plans 

discount rates are used to estimate the net present value of our pension and other postemployment plan obligations these rates are determined at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of highquality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits the selection of discount rates requires judgment as well as the involvement of actuarial specialists these specialists assist with selecting yield curves based on published indices for highquality corporate bonds and projecting the timing and amount of cash flows associated with our obligations to ultimately support our determination of an appropriate discount rate for each plan

our discount rates as of december 31 2021 are

 



 

pension expenses for 2022 will be based on the 29 percent and 31 percent assumed discount rates for the us pension plan and the canadian pension plan respectively and the 26 percent and 30 percent assumed discount rates for the us and canadian postemployment benefit plans respectively

our discount rates are important in determining the cost of our plans a 50 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately

 



 

impairment of longlived assets

we review the carrying value of longlived assets whenever an event or a change in circumstance indicates that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable through future operations the carrying value is the original cost less accumulated depreciation and any past impairments recorded refer to note 4 timberland acquisitions and divestitures for information on an impairment recognized in 2019 

if we evaluate recoverability we are required to estimate future cash flows and residual values of the asset or asset group key assumptions used in developing these estimates would include probability of alternative outcomes product pricing raw material cost and product sales

an impairment occurs when the carrying value of a longlived asset is greater than the amount that could be recovered from the estimated future cash flows of the asset and greater than fair market value the amount we could receive if we were to sell the asset  key assumptions used in developing estimates of fair value would include the estimated future cash flows used to assess recoverability discount rates and probability of alternative outcomes

contingent liabilities

we are subject to lawsuits investigations and other claims related to environmental product and other matters and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as the amount or range of potential loss

we record contingent liabilities when

 



 

assessing probability of loss and estimating the amount of loss can require analysis of multiple factors such as

 



 

in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred

recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain if estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we record additional charges these exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flows in any given quarter or year see note 14 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies for more information

performance measures

 

 

we use adjusted ebitda as a key performance measure to evaluate the performance of the consolidated company and our business segments this measure should not be considered in isolation from and is not intended to represent an alternative to our results reported in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap however we believe adjusted ebitda provides meaningful supplemental information for our investors about our operating performance better facilitates period to period comparisons and is widely used by analysts lenders rating agencies and other interested parties our definition of adjusted ebitda may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies adjusted ebitda as we define it is operating income adjusted for depreciation depletion amortization basis of real estate sold and special items 

 

adjusted ebitda by segment

 



 

we reconcile adjusted ebitda to net earnings for the consolidated company and to operating income for the business segments as those are the most directly comparable us gaap measures for each

real estate energy and natural resources

our real estate  enr segment maximizes the value of our timberland ownership through application of our asset value optimization avo process and captures the full value of surface and subsurface assets such as construction materials industrial minerals oil natural gas and wind and solar resources

what we do

real estate

properties that exhibit higher use value than commercial timberlands are monetized by our real estate business over time we analyze our existing us timberland holdings using a process we call avo we start with understanding the value of a parcel operating as commercial timberlands and then assess the specific real estate attributes of the parcel and its corresponding market the assessment includes demographics infrastructure and proximity to amenities and recreation to determine the potential to realize a premium value to commercial timberland attributes can evolve over time and accordingly the assignment of value and opportunity can change we continually revisit our avo assessment for all our timberland acres

we expect to sell these properties for recreational conservation commercial or residential purposes over time we will entitle a small amount of acres to support development development outside of entitlement activities is typically performed by third parties some of our real estate activities are conducted through our trss

occasionally we sell a small amount of timberlands acreage in areas where we choose to reduce our market presence and capture a price that exceeds the value derivable from holding and operating as commercial timberlands these transactions will vary based on factors including the locations and physical characteristics of the timberlands

the volume of real estate sales is a function of many factors including the general state of the economy demand in local real estate markets the ability of buyers to obtain financing the number of competing properties listed for sale the seasonal nature of sales particularly in the northern states the plans of adjacent landowners our expectation of future price appreciation the timing of harvesting activities and the availability of government and notforprofit funding in any period the average sales price per acre will vary based on the location and physical characteristics of parcels sold

energy and natural resources 

we focus on maximizing potential opportunities for construction materials industrial minerals renewable energy including wind and solar energy oil natural gas rights of way easements on our timberlands portfolio and retained mineral interests

as the owner of mineral rights and interests we typically do not invest in development or operations but instead enter into contracts with operators granting them the rights to explore and sell energy and natural resources produced from our property in exchange for rents and royalties 

we generally reserve mineral rights when selling timberlands acreage some energy and natural resources activities are conducted through our trss

natural resource and environmental matters

 

we are subject to a multitude of laws and regulations in the operation of our businesses we also participate in voluntary certification of our timberlands to ensure that we sustain their overall quality including the protection of wildlife and water quality changes in law and regulation or certification standards can significantly affect our business

regulations affecting forestry practices

in the united states regulations established by federal state and local government agencies to protect water quality wetlands and other wildlife habitat could affect future harvests and forest management practices on our timberlands forest practice laws and regulations that affect present or future harvest and forest management activities in certain states include

 



 

each state in which we own timberlands has developed best management practices to reduce the effects of forest practices on water quality and aquatic habitats additional and more stringent regulations may be adopted by various state and local governments to achieve waterquality standards under the federal clean water act protect fish and wildlife habitats human health or achieve other public policy objectives

in canada our forest operations are carried out on public timberlands under forest licenses with the provinces all forest operations in canada are subject to

 



in canada 21 member companies of the forest products association of canada fpac including weyerhaeuser ’ s canadian subsidiary announced in may 2010 the signing of a canadian boreal forest agreement cbfa with nine environmental organizations the cbfa applies to approximately 72 million hectares of public forests licensed to fpac members and when fully implemented was expected to lead to the conservation of significant areas of canada ’ s boreal forest and protection of boreal species at risk in particular woodland caribou while the cbfa mandate came to an end in 2017 cbfa signatories continue to work on management plans with provincial governments and seek the participation of aboriginal and local communities in advancing the goals of the cbfa

endangered species protections

in the united states a number of fish and wildlife species that inhabit geographic areas near or within our timberlands have been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal endangered species act esa or similar state laws including but not limited to

 



additional species or populations may be listed as threatened or endangered as a result of pending or future citizen petitions or petitions initiated by federal or state agencies in addition significant citizen litigation seeks to compel the federal agencies to designate critical habitat for esalisted species and many cases have resulted in settlements under which designations will be implemented over time such designations may adversely affect some management activities and options restrictions on timber harvests can result from

 



such actions could increase our operating costs and affect timber supply and prices in general to date we do not believe that these measures have had and we do not believe that in 2021 they will have a significant effect on our harvesting operations we anticipate that likely future actions will not disproportionately affect weyerhaeuser as compared with comparable operations of us competitors

weyerhaeuser company  2020 annual report and form 10k 21 

 

in canada 

 



the identification and protection of habitat and the implementation of range plans and land use action plans may over time result in additional restrictions on timber harvests and other forest management practices that could increase operating costs for operators of timberlands in canada to date we do not believe that these canadian measures have had and we do not believe that in 2021 they will have a significant effect on our harvesting operations we anticipate that likely future measures will not disproportionately affect weyerhaeuser as compared with similar operations of canadian competitors

forest certification standards

we operate in north america under the sustainable forestry initiative ® sfi this is a certification standard designed to supplement government regulatory programs with voluntary landowner initiatives to further protect certain public resources and values sfi is an independent standard overseen by a governing board consisting of

 



ongoing compliance with sfi may result in some increases in our operating costs and reduction of our timber harvests in some areas there is also competition from other private certification systems primarily the forest stewardship council fsc coupled with efforts by supporters to further those systems by persuading customers of forest products to require products certified to their preferred system certain features of the fsc system could impose additional operating costs on timberland management because of the considerable variation in fsc standards and variability in how those standards are interpreted and applied if sufficient marketplace demand develops for products made from raw materials sourced from other than sficertified forests we could incur substantial additional costs for operations and be required to reduce harvest levels

what these regulations and certification programs mean to us

the regulatory and nonregulatory forest management programs described above have

 



we believe that these regulations and programs have not had and in 2021 will not have a significant effect on our total harvest of timber in the united states or canada however these kinds of programs may have such an effect in the future we expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these programs as compared with typical owners of comparable timberlands we also expect that these programs will not significantly disrupt our planned operations over large areas or for extended periods

canadian aboriginal rights

many of the canadian timberlands are subject to the constitutionally protected treaty or commonlaw rights of aboriginal peoples of canada most of british columbia bc is not covered by treaties and as a result the claims of bc’s aboriginal peoples relating to forest resources have been largely unresolved nonetheless the supreme court of canada ruled that the tsilhqot’in nation holds aboriginal title to approximately 1900 square kilometers in bc the first time the court has declared title to exist based on historical occupation by aboriginal peoples many aboriginal groups continue to be engaged in treaty discussions with the governments of bc other provinces and canada

final or interim resolution of claims brought by aboriginal groups can be expected to result in

 



weyerhaeuser company  2020 annual report and form 10k 22 

 

 

we believe that such claims will not have a significant effect on our total harvest of timber or production of forest products in 2021  although they may have such an effect in the future 

pollutioncontrol regulations

our operations are subject to various federal state provincial and local pollution control laws and regulations

these laws and regulations as well as market demands impose controls with regard to

 



compliance with these laws regulations and demands usually involves capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs we cannot easily quantify the future amounts of capital expenditures we might have to make to comply with these laws regulations and demands or the effects on our operating costs because in some instances compliance standards have not been developed or have not become final or definitive in addition it is difficult to isolate the environmental component of most manufacturing capital projects

our capital projects typically are designed to

 



 

environmental cleanup

we are involved in the environmental investigation or remediation of numerous sites of these sites

 



our liability with respect to these various sites ranges from insignificant to substantial the amount of liability depends on the

 



we spent approximately 8 million in 2020 and expect to spend approximately 6 million in 2021 on environmental remediation of these sites

it is our policy to accrue for environmental remediation costs when we

 



based on currently available information and analysis we believe it is reasonably possible that our costs to remediate all the identified sites may exceed our current accruals of 57 million by up to 121 million this estimate of the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs is much less certain than the estimates we currently are using to determine how much to accrue the estimate of the upper range also relies on assumptions less favorable to us among the range of reasonably possible outcomes

regulation of air emissions in the us

the united states environmental protection agency epa has promulgated regulations for air emissions from

 



these regulations cover

 



weyerhaeuser company  2020 annual report and form 10k 23 

 

 

the epa has issued several rules relating to mact standards and the emission of greenhouse gases from various energyproducing sources several court decisions have made the extent of applicability of these rules uncertain depending on the final outcomes of these decisions these regulatory programs could affect our operations by increasing the cost of purchasing electricity or from mandated energy demand reductions that could apply to our mills and other facilities that we operate the epa is also expected to issue rules relating to biomass emissions which is a significant source of energy at our mills the effect of these existing and future emissions regulations as well as related court decisions on our operations remains uncertain we continue to track and evaluate the litigation and regulatory developments but are not able to predict whether the regulations when complete and implemented will have a material effect on our operations

to address concerns about greenhouse gases as a pollutant we

 



additional factors that could affect regulation of greenhouse gas emissions in the future include

 



 

we believe these developments have not had and in 2021 will not have a significant effect on our operations although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations we maintain an active forestry research program to track and understand any potential effect from actual climate change related parameters that could affect the forests we own and manage and do not anticipate any disruptions to our planned operations

regulation of air emissions in canada

our wood products facilities are regulated in canada under provincial air quality rules the canadian federal government has also proposed an air quality management system aqms as a comprehensive national approach for improving air quality in canada to go along with existing provincial air quality regulations the aqms includes

 



 

in addition to these existing and proposed regulations environment and climate change canada a canadian federal agency released the pancanadian framework on clean growth and climate change a greenhouse gas emission framework the framework put in place a national sectorbased greenhouse gas reduction program applicable to a number of industries including ours

all canadian provincial governments

 



along with clean air regulations british columbia a province in which we operate has adopted a carbon tax and alberta where we also have operations has a mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction regulation

although these and related regulations and measures have not had and we do not expect in 2021 that they will have a material effect on our operations they could in the future

regulation of water in the us

our operations are regulated under the clean water act which regulates the discharge of pollutants into the waters of the us this generally means obtaining permits for certain of our silviculture activities and abiding by applicable restrictions federal agency rulemaking and related litigation under the act has led to increased jurisdiction of the act by expanding the definition of waterways subject to the act’s regulation this in turn has increased the number of required federal and state permits in some areas of our operations as it relates to the application of pesticides and herbicides on timberlands which has increased operating costs pending and future federal and state rulemaking and judicial challenges thereto could make application of the clean water act as well as comparable state laws more or less costly to weyerhaeuser and we are not able to predict the final resolution of these matters although this and related regulations have not had and we do not expect in 2021 that they will have a material effect on our operations they could in the future

weyerhaeuser company  2020 annual report and form 10k 24 

 

regulation of water in canada 

changes to the canadian federal fisheries act have moved the focus of that legislation from habitat protection to fisheries protection and increased penalties we expect further changes to these regulations but we cannot predict the scope or potential effect if any on our operations although this and related canadian regulations have not had and we do not expect in 2021 that they will have a material effect on our operations they could in the future

potential changes in pollution regulation

state governments in the us continue to promulgate total maximum daily load tmdl requirements for pollutants in water bodies that do not meet state or epa water quality standards state tmdl requirements may set

 



 

moreover some states including at least two in which we operate have adopted or have introduced legislation to adopt humanhealthbased water quality standards these requirements may alter or introduce restrictions on some of our silviculture activities notably the application of pesticides and herbicides to our timberlands in some areas in canada various levels of government have been working to address water issues including use quality and management recent areas of focus include water allocation regional watershed protection protection of drinking water water pricing and a national water quality index

although these developments have not had and we do not expect in 2021 that they will have a material effect on our operations they could in the future

 risk factors

we are subject to various risks and events that could adversely affect our business our financial condition our results of operations our cash flows and the price of our common stock

you should consider the following risk factors in addition to the information presented elsewhere in this report particularly in our business  forwardlooking statements and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda  as well as in the filings we make from time to time with the sec in evaluating us our business and an investment in our securities 

the risks discussed below are not the only risks we face additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely affect our business our financial condition our results of operations our cash flows and the price of our common stock

 

 

risks related to our business and industry

 

 

market and other external risks

the industries in which we operate are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions and consequently are highly cyclical

the overall levels of demand for the products we manufacture and distribute reflect fluctuations in levels of enduser demand which consequently affect our sales and profitability enduser demand depends in large part on general macroeconomic conditions both in the us and globally as well as on local economic conditions the length and magnitude of industry cycles vary over time both by market and by product but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions and levels of industry capacity any decline or stagnation in macroeconomic conditions could cause us to experience lower sales volume and reduced margins for our products

low demand for new homes and home repair and remodeling can adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows

our business is particularly dependent upon the health of the us housing market and specifically on demand for new homes and home repair and remodeling demand in these markets is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as the level of employment consumer confidence consumer income the availability of financing and interest rate levels other factors that could limit or adversely affect demand for new homes and home repair and remodeling and hence demand for our products include factors such as changes in consumer preferences limited wage growth increases in nonmortgage consumer debt any weakening in consumer confidence as well as any increase in foreclosure rates and distress sales of houses

catastrophic events may adversely affect the markets for our products and our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

we are subject to the risk of various catastrophic events including but not limited to the occurrence of significant fires on one or more of our properties severe regional or local weather events or trends major earthquakes significant geopolitical conditions or developments such as significant international trade disputes terrorist attacks armed conflict domestic political unrest and regional health epidemics or global health pandemics any one or more of these events or conditions or other catastrophic events or developments could significantly affect our ability to operate our businesses and adversely affect domestic and global general economic conditions and thus market demand for our products 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus “covid19” a global pandemic in response federal state and local governments in the united states as well as governments throughout the world declared states of emergency and ordered preventative measures to contain and mitigate the spread of the virus these measures which have included shelterinplace and similar mandates for individuals and closure or significant curtailment of many businesses have caused significant economic disruption and uncertainty as well as disruption and volatility in global capital markets as a result there have been periodic adverse effects on the demand for our timber and wood products and disruptions to our supply chain and the manufacturing distribution and export of our timber and wood products all of which could worsen in the future any one or more of these consequences of covid19 as well as other unpredictable events could materially adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition the covid19 outbreak continues to rapidly evolve with periods of improvement followed by periods of higher infection rates in various geographical locations throughout the world the extent to which covid19 may further affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition as well as our plans and decisions relating to various capital expenditures other discretionary items and capital allocation priorities including the timing and amount of our dividends to shareholders are therefore highly uncertain and will depend on future developments which cannot be predicted with confidence such developments include but are not limited to the future rate of occurrence or mutation of covid19 or the outbreak of another virulent disease continuation of or changes in governmental responses to disease outbreak the duration of disease outbreak and consequential restrictions business disruptions the effectiveness of responsive government actions to contain and manage the disease and the timing and effectiveness of treatment and testing options including the efficacy and availability of vaccines

the impacts of the covid19 outbreak and related restrictions have led to a significant increase in national unemployment since the outset of the pandemic an extended continuation or worsening of domestic unemployment may adversely affect demand for our products and thus negatively impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition the impact of covid19 or other virulent disease may also trigger the occurrence or exacerbate other risks discussed herein any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for more discussion on the current effects of covid19 on our business 

weyerhaeuser company  2020 annual report and form 10k 27 

 

and operations see our discussion under management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda – economic and market conditions affecting our operations  

homebuyers’ ability to qualify for and obtain affordable mortgages could be affected by changes in interest rates changes in home loan underwriting standards and government sponsored entities and private mortgage insurance companies supporting the mortgage market

access to affordable mortgage financing is critical to the health of the us housing market generally increases in interest rates make it more difficult for home buyers to obtain mortgage financing which could negatively affect demand for housing and in turn negatively affect demand for our wood products interest rates have remained at historically low levels for an extended period of time although the us federal reserve has made both upward and downward adjustments in recent years we cannot predict the timing number extent or direction of future rate adjustments

along with prevailing interest rates other significant factors affecting the demand for new homes relate to the ability of home buyers to obtain mortgage financing during the last us recession credit requirements for home lending were severely tightened and the number of mortgage loans available for financing home purchases were thereby severely reduced although the availability of credit has improved since that time the housing market could be limited or adversely affected if credit requirements were to again tighten or become more restrictive for any reason

additionally the liquidity provided to the mortgage industry by fannie mae and freddie mac both of which purchase home mortgages and mortgagebacked securities originated by mortgage lenders has been critical to the home lending market any political or other developments that would have the effect of limiting or restricting the availability of financing by these government sponsored entities could also adversely affect interest rates and the availability of mortgage financing whether resulting from direct increases in borrowing rates tightened underwriting standards on mortgage loans or reduced federal support of the mortgage lending industry a challenging mortgage financing environment could reduce demand for housing and therefore adversely affect demand for our products

changes in regulations relating to tax deductions for mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes could harm our future sales and earnings

significant costs of homeownership include mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes both of which are generally deductible for an individual’s federal and in some cases state income taxes recent federal legislation reduced the amount of mortgage interest and real estate taxes that certain taxpayers may deduct these and any similar changes to income tax laws by the federal government or by a state government to eliminate or substantially reduce these income tax deductions or any significant increase in real property taxes by local governments may increase the cost of homeownership and thus could adversely affect the demand for our products

product pricing and profitability

our profitability is affected by market dynamics outside of our control

because commodity products have few distinguishing properties from producer to producer competition for these products is based primarily on price which is determined by supply relative to demand and competition from substitute products prices for our products are also affected by many other factors outside of our control as a result we have little influence or control over the timing and extent of price changes which often are volatile in our industry moreover our profit margins with respect to these products depend in part on managing our costs particularly raw material labor including contract labor and energy costs which represent significant cost components that also fluctuate based upon market and other factors beyond our control 

excess supply of logs and wood products may adversely affect prices and margins

producers in our industry have in the past put downward pressure on product pricing by selling excess supply into the market our industry may increase harvest levels which could lead to an oversupply of logs wood products producers may likewise expand manufacturing capacity which could lead to an oversupply of manufactured wood products any such increases of industry supply to our markets could adversely affect our prices and margins

thirdparty service providers

we depend heavily on third parties for logging and transportation services and any increase in the cost or any disruption in the availability of these services could materially adversely affect our business and operations and our financial results

our businesses depend heavily on the availability of thirdparty service providers for the harvest of our timber and the transportation of our wood products and wood fiber we are therefore considerably affected by the availability and cost of these services any significant increase in the operating costs to our service providers including without limitation an increase in the cost of fuel or labor could have a material negative effect on our financial results by increasing the cost of these services to us as well as result in an overall reduction in the availability of these services altogether

our thirdparty transportation providers are also subject to several events outside of their control such as disruption of transportation infrastructure labor issues and natural disasters any failure of a thirdparty transportation provider to timely deliver our products including delivery of our wood products and wood fiber to our customers and delivery of wood fiber to our mills could harm our supply chain negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and our reputation

as a result of weak business conditions in the timber industry that persisted for several years there are fewer thirdparty service providers in certain markets to harvest and deliver our logs this shortage has resulted in an overall increase in logging and hauling costs and in some 

weyerhaeuser company  2020 annual report and form 10k 28 

 

cases compromised the general availability of these contractors any increase in harvest levels due to positive changes in macroeconomic conditions driving demand for logs could further strain the existing supply of thirdparty logging and hauling service providers this in turn could increase the cost of log supply and delivery or prevent us from fully capitalizing on favorable market conditions by limiting our ability to access and deliver our logs to market 

managing commercial timberlands risks

our ability to harvest and deliver timber may be subject to limitations which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows

our primary assets are our timberlands weather conditions timber growth cycles access limitations and availability of contract loggers and haulers may adversely affect our ability to harvest our timberlands other factors that may adversely affect our timber harvest include damage to our standing timber by fire or by insect infestation disease prolonged drought flooding severe weather and other natural disasters as discussed in more detail in the following risk factors changes in global climate conditions could intensify the severity and rate of occurrence of any one or more of these risks that we currently face although damage from such causes usually is localized and affects only a limited percentage of standing timber there can be no assurance that any damage affecting our timberlands will in fact be limited as is common in the forest products industry we do not maintain insurance coverage for damage to our timberlands our revenues net income and cash flow from operations are dependent to a significant extent on the pricing of our products and our continued ability to harvest timber at adequate levels therefore if we were to be restricted from harvesting on a significant portion of our timberlands for a prolonged period of time or if material damage to a significant portion of our standing timber were to occur we could suffer materially adverse effects to our results of operations and cash flows

future timber harvest levels may also be affected by our ability to timely and effectively replant harvested areas which depends on several factors including changes in estimates of longterm sustainable yield because of silvicultural advances natural disasters fires pests insects and other hazards regulatory constraints availability of contractors and other factors beyond our control

timber harvest activities are also subject to a number of federal state and local regulations pertaining to the protection of fish wildlife water and other resources regulations government agency policy and guidelines and litigation can restrict timber harvest activities and increase costs examples include federal and state laws protecting threatened endangered and “atrisk” species harvesting and forestry road building activities that may be restricted under the us federal clean water act state forestry practices laws laws protecting aboriginal rights and other similar regulations

our estimates of timber inventories and growth rates may be inaccurate and include risks inherent in calculating such estimates which may impair our ability to realize expected revenues

whether in connection with managing our existing timberland portfolio or assessing potential timberland acquisitions we make and rely on important estimates of merchantable timber inventories these include estimates of timber inventories that may be lawfully and economically harvested timber growth rates and endproduct yields timber growth rates and yield estimates are developed by forest biometricians and other experts using statistical measurements of tree samples on given property these estimates are central to forecasting our anticipated timber harvests revenues and expected cash flows while the company has confidence in its timber inventory processes and the professionals in the field who administer it future growth and yield estimates are inherently inexact and uncertain and subject to many external variables that could further affect their accuracy these include among other things disease infestation natural disasters and changes in weather patterns if these estimates are inaccurate our ability to manage our timberlands in a sustainable or profitable manner may be compromised which may cause our results of operations cash flows and our stock price to be adversely affected

our operating results and cash flows will be materially affected by supply and demand for timber

a variety of factors affect prices for timber including available supply changes in economic conditions that affect demand the level of domestic new construction and remodeling activity interest rates credit availability population growth weather conditions and pest infestation and other factors these factors vary by region by timber type ie sawlogs or pulpwood logs and by species

timber prices are affected by changes in demand on a local national and international level the closure of a mill in a region where we own timber could have a material adverse effect on demand in that region and therefore pricing for example as the demand for paper continues to decline closures of pulp mills in some of our operating regions have adversely affected the regional demand for pulpwood and wood chips additionally some of our asian log export markets particularly china have a history of significant volatility lower demand for our export logs could have a negative effect on timber prices particularly in the western region

timber prices are also affected by changes in timber supply and availability at the local national and international level our timberland ownership is concentrated in alabama arkansas louisiana mississippi north carolina oklahoma oregon and washington in some of these states much of the timberland is privately owned increases in timber prices often result in substantial increases in harvesting on private timberlands including lands not previously made available for commercial timber operations causing a shortterm increase in supply that moderates such price increases in western states such as oregon and washington where a greater proportion of timberland is governmentowned any substantial increase in timber harvesting from governmentowned land could significantly reduce timber prices on a local level timber supplies can fluctuate depending on factors such as changes in weather conditions and harvest strategies of local timberland owners as well as occasionally high timber salvage efforts due to events such as pest infestations fires or other natural disasters demand for timber in foreign markets can fluctuate due to a variety of factors as well including but not limited to changes in the fundamental economic conditions that affect demand for logs in a given export market country or region any substantial increase in supply of logs from local or regional sources including such sources that periodically supply large amounts of salvage timber as a result of disease or infestation and other factors 

weyerhaeuser company  2020 annual report and form 10k 29 

 

timberlands make up a significant portion of our business portfolio and we are therefore subject to real estate investment risks 

our real property holdings are primarily timberlands and we may make additional timberlands acquisitions in the future as the owner and manager of approximately 11 million acres of timberlands we are subject to the risks that are inherent in concentrated real estate investments a downturn in the real estate industry generally or the timber or forest products industries specifically could reduce the value of our properties and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows such a downturn could also adversely affect our customers and reduce the demand for our products as well as our ability to execute upon our strategy of selling nonstrategic timberlands and timberland properties that have higher and better uses at attractive prices these risks may be more pronounced than if we diversified our investments outside of real property holdings 

manufacturing and selling wood products risks

a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales and negatively affect our results of operation and financial condition

any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including  

 



 

we cannot predict the duration of any such downtime or extent of facility damage if one of our facilities or machines were to incur significant downtime our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer demand could be impaired resulting in lower sales and income additionally we may be required to make significant unplanned capital expenditures although some risks are not insurable and some coverage is limited we purchase insurance on our manufacturing facilities for damage from fires floods windstorms earthquakes equipment failures and boiler explosions such insurance may not be sufficient to recover all of our damages

some of our wood products are vulnerable to declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials

our products compete with nonfiber based alternatives or with alternative products in certain market segments for example plastic woodplastic or composite materials may be used by builders as alternatives to our wood products such as lumber veneer plywood and oriented strand board changes in prices for oil chemicals and woodbased fiber can change the competitive position of our products relative to available alternatives and could increase substitution of those products for our products if use of these or other alternative products grows demand for and pricing of our products could be adversely affected  

our results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by changes in product mix or pricing

our results may be materially adversely affected by a change in our product mix or pricing some of our wood products such as lumber veneer plywood and oriented strand board are commodities and are subject to fluctuations in market pricing if pricing on our commodity products decreases and if we are not successful in increasing sales of higherpriced highervalue products or if we are not successful in implementing price increases or there are delays in acceptance of price increases or higherpriced products our results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected price discounting if required to maintain our competitive position in one or more markets could result in lower than anticipated price realizations and margins

we face intense competition in our markets any failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

we compete with north american producers and for some of our product lines global producers some of which may have greater financial resources and lower production costs than we do the principal basis for competition for many of our products is selling price our industries also are particularly sensitive to other factors including innovation design quality and service with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line to the extent that any of our competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor our ability to attract and retain customers and maintain and increase sales could be materially adversely affected any failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

weyerhaeuser company  2020 annual report and form 10k 30 

 

competition from lumber imports could vary significantly and have a material effect on us lumber and timber prices 

the future amount and pricing of lumber imports entering us markets remain uncertain historically canada has been the most significant source of lumber for the us market particularly in the new home construction market we produce lumber in our canadian mills but the bulk of our lumber production is in the us there have been many disputes and subsequent trade agreements regarding sales of softwood lumber between canada and the us the last agreement which required canadian softwood lumber facilities including our mills to pay an export tax when the price of lumber is at or below a threshold price expired in october 2015 since that time the us department of commerce has issued countervailing and antidumping duties on softwood lumber imports from canada based on findings of injury to us lumber producers

we are not able to predict when or if a new softwood lumber agreement will be reached or if reached what the terms of the agreement would be similarly we are not able to predict if the current us policy of imposing import duties on canadian softwood lumber will continue we could therefore experience significant downward pressure on timber and lumber prices caused by canadian lumber imports

customer demand for certain brands of sustainablyproduced products could reduce competition among buyers for our products or cause other adverse effects

we have adopted the sustainable forestry initiative sfi standard for wood fiber supplied to our manufacturing facilities both from our timberlands and from thirdparty suppliers if customer preference for a sustainability standard other than sfi   increases or if the sfi   standard falls into disfavor  there may be reduced demand and lower prices for our products relative to competitors who can supply products sourced from forests certified to competing certification standards if we seek to comply with such other standards we could incur materially increased costs for our operations or be required to modify our operations such as reducing harvest levels fsc in particular employs standards that are geographically variable and could cause a material reduction in the harvest levels of some of our timberlands most notably in the pacific northwest

our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials and energy

we rely heavily on certain raw materials principally wood fiber and chemicals and energy sources principally natural gas electricity and fuel oil in our manufacturing processes our ability to increase earnings has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials and energy sources we may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material or energy costs through price increases productivity improvements costreduction programs or hedging arrangements

physical risks related to climate change

changes in global or regional climate conditions could significantly harm our timberland assets and have a negative impact on our results of operations cash flow and profitability of our operations

climate change has the potential to cause significant disruptions to our business and results of operations cash flow and profitability there is increasing concern that increases in global average temperatures caused by increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could cause significant changes in weather patterns including changes to precipitation patterns and growing seasons these changes could in the long term and in some locations lead to slower growth of our trees and potentially changes to the species mix that we manage in our timber assets an increase in global temperature could also lead to an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and other natural disasters thus damage or access to our timberland assets by existing causes such as fire insect infestation disease prolonged drought flooding windstorms and other natural disasters could be significantly worsened by climate change any one or more of these negative effects on commercial timberland operations from climate change both our own and that of other commercial timberland operators could also have a material adverse impact on our wood products business by significantly affecting the availability cost and quality of the wood fiber used in our mill operations

workforce risk

our business is dependent upon attracting retaining and developing key personnel

our   success depends to a significant extent upon our ability to attract retain and develop senior management operations management and other key personnel our financial condition or results of operations could be significantly adversely affected if we were to fail to recruit retain and develop such personnel or if there were to occur any significant increase in the cost of providing such personnel with competitive total compensation and benefits

a strike or other work stoppage or our inability to renew collective bargaining agreements on favorable terms could adversely affect our financial results

as of december 31 2020 a significant number of employees in our western timberlands and wood products businesses were covered by collective bargaining agreements if these workers were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage or if our nonunionized operations were to become unionized we could experience a significant disruption of operations at our facilities or higher ongoing labor costs a significant customer or supplier strike or other work stoppage could also have similar effects on us

pension plan liability risk

investment returns on our pension assets may be lower than expected or interest rates may decline requiring us to make significant additional cash contributions to our benefit plans

a portion of our current and former employees have accrued benefits under our defined benefit pension plans although the plans are not open to employees hired on or after january 1 2014 current employees hired before that time continue to accrue benefits requirements for funding our pension plan liabilities are based on a number of actuarial assumptions including the expected rate of return on our plan assets and the 

weyerhaeuser company  2020 annual report and form 10k 31 

 

discount rate applied to our pension plan obligations fluctuations in equity market returns and changes in longterm interest rates could increase our costs under our defined benefit pension plans and may significantly affect future contribution requirements it is unknown what the actual investment return on our pension assets will be in future years and what interest rates may be at any given point in time we cannot therefore provide any assurance of what our actual pension plan costs will be in the future or whether we will be required under applicable law to make future material plan contributions see note 9 pension and other postemployment benefit plans for additional information about these plans including funding status 

strategic initiatives and execution risk

our business and financial results may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully execute on important strategic initiatives

our strategic initiatives are designed to improve our results of operations and drive longterm shareholder value these initiatives include among others optimizing cash flow through operational excellence reducing costs to achieve industryleading cost structure and innovating in highermargin products there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement any one or more of our important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations which could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial results

we may be unsuccessful in carrying out our acquisition strategy

we intend to strategically pursue acquisitions and strategic divestitures when market conditions warrant as with any investment our acquisitions may not perform in accordance with our expectations in addition we anticipate financing such acquisitions through cash from operations borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities proceeds from equity or debt offerings or proceeds from strategic asset dispositions or any combination thereof our inability to finance future acquisitions on favorable terms or at all could adversely affect our ability to successfully execute strategic acquisitions and thereby adversely affect our results of operations 

foreign currency risk

we will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates

we have manufacturing operations in canada we are also an exporter and compete with global producers of products very similar to ours therefore we are affected by changes in the strength of the us dollar particularly relative to the canadian dollar euro yuan and yen and the strength of the euro relative to the yen changes in exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our sales volume margins and results of operations

 

 

legal regulatory and tax risks

 

environmental laws and regulations

we could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with violations of or liabilities under applicable environmental laws and other laws and regulations

we are subject to a wide range of general and industryspecific laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing  

 



 

we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations and as a result of remedial obligations   and there can be no assurances that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future costs we also could incur substantial costs such as civil or criminal fines sanctions and enforcement actions including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions cleanup and closure costs and thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations

as the owner and operator of real estate we may be liable under environmental laws for cleanup closure and other damages resulting from the presence and release of hazardous substances on or from our properties or operations in addition surface water management regulations may present liabilities and are subject to change the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict and in some cases our 

weyerhaeuser company  2020 annual report and form 10k 32 

 

liability may exceed forecasted amounts or the value of the property itself the discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at our sites or thirdparty sites may result in significant additional costs 

we also lease some of our properties to thirdparty operators for the purpose of exploring extracting developing and producing oil gas rock and other minerals in exchange for fees and royalty payments these activities are also subject to federal state and local laws and regulations these operations may create risk of environmental liabilities for any unlawful discharge of oil gas or other chemicals into the air soil or water generally these thirdparty operators indemnify us against any such liability and we require that that they maintain liability insurance during the term of our lease with them however if for any reason our thirdparty operators are not able to honor their indemnity obligation or if the required liability insurance were not in effect then it is possible that we could be deemed responsible for costs associated with   environmental liability caused by such thirdparty operators

any material liability we incur as a result of activities conducted on our properties by us or by others with whom we have a business relationship could adversely affect our financial condition

we also anticipate public policy developments at the state federal and international level regarding climate change and energy access security and competitiveness as discussed below we expect these developments to address emission of carbon dioxide renewable energy and fuel standards and the monetization of carbon these developments may also include mandated changes to energy use and building codes which could affect homebuilding practices enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretation of these laws or regulations might require significant expenditures we also anticipate public policy developments at the state federal and international level regarding taxes and a number of other areas that could require significant expenditures

legal and regulatory risks related to climate change

governmental response to climate change at the international federal and state levels may affect our results of operations cash flows and profitability

there continue to be numerous international us federal and statelevel initiatives and proposals to address domestic and global climate issues within the us and canada some of these proposals would regulate and in some canadian provinces do regulate andor tax the production of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to facilitate the reduction of carbon compound emissions into the atmosphere and provide tax and other incentives to produce and use cleaner energy climate change effects if they occur and governmental initiatives laws and regulations to address potential climate concerns could increase our costs and have a longterm adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations future legislation or regulatory activity in this area remains uncertain and its effect on our operations is unclear at this time 

however climate change legislation or related government mandates standards or regulations intended to mitigate or reduce carbon compound greenhouse gas emissions or other climate change effects could have significant adverse effects on our business and operations any one or more of such new legal requirements and regulations could for example significantly increase the costs for our mills to comply with stricter air emissions regulations they could also limit harvest levels for commercial timberland operators which could in turn adversely affect our timberland operations as well as potentially lead to significant increases in the cost of energy wood fiber and other raw materials for our wood products businesses any one or more of these developments as well as other unforeseeable governmental responses to climate change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and profitability

legal matters

we are involved in various environmental regulatory product liability and other legal matters disputes and proceedings that if determined or concluded in a manner adverse to our interests could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition

we are from time to time involved in a number of legal matters disputes and proceedings legal matters some of which involve ongoing litigation these include without limitation legal matters involving environmental cleanup and remediation warranty and nonwarranty product liability claims regulatory issues contractual and personal injury claims and other legal matters in some cases all or a portion of any loss we experience in connection with any such legal matters will be covered by insurance in other cases any such losses will not be covered

the outcome costs and other effects of current legal matters in which we are involved and any related insurance recoveries cannot be determined with certainty although the disclosures in note 14 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies and note 20 income taxes contain management ’ s current views of the effect such legal matters could have on our financial results there can be no assurance that the outcome of such legal matters will be as currently expected it is possible that there could be adverse judgments against us in some or all major litigation matters against us and that we could be required to take a charge and make cash payments for all or a portion of any related awards of damages any one or more of such charges or cash payment could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows for the quarter or year in which we record or pay it

reit status and tax implications

if we fail to remain qualified as a reit our taxable income would be subject to tax at corporate rates and we would not be able to deduct dividends to shareholders

in any taxable year in which we fail to qualify as a reit unless we are entitled to relief under the internal revenue code  

 



weyerhaeuser company  2020 annual report and form 10k 33 

 



 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code to our operations and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions although we operate in a manner consistent with the reit qualification rules we cannot assure you that we are or will remain so qualified

certain of our business activities are subject to corporatelevel income tax and potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax

under the internal revenue code reits generally must engage in the ownership and management of income producing real estate for the company this generally includes owning and managing a timberland portfolio for the production and sale of standing timber any activities that generate nonqualifying reit income could constitute “prohibited transactions” prohibited transactions are defined by the internal revenue code generally to be sales or other dispositions of property to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business accordingly the harvesting and sale of logs the development or sale of certain timberlands and other real estate and the manufacture and sale of wood products are conducted through one or more of our whollyowned trss the net income of which is subject to corporatelevel tax by conducting our business in this manner we believe that we satisfy the reit requirements of the internal revenue code however if the internal revenue service irs were to successfully assert that these or any of our activities conducted at the reit constituted prohibited transactions we could be subject to the 100 percent tax on the net income from such activities

the extent of our use of our trss may affect the price of our common shares relative to the share price of other reits

we conduct a significant portion of our business activities through one or more trss the use of our trss enables us to engage in nonreit qualifying business activities such as the harvesting and sale of logs manufacture and sale of wood products and the development and sale of certain higher and better use hbu property our trss are subject to corporatelevel income tax under the code no more than 20 percent of the value of the gross assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss this limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our trss’ operations furthermore our use of trss may cause the market to value our common shares differently than the shares of other reits which may not use trss at all or as extensively as we use them

we may be limited in our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our trss

the ability of the reit to receive dividends from our trss is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a reit in particular at least 75 percent of gross income for each taxable year as a reit must be derived from real estate sources including sales of our standing timber and other types of qualifying real estate income and no more than 25 percent of our gross income may consist of dividends from our trss and other nonreal estate income this limitation on our ability to receive dividends from our trss may affect our ability to fund cash distributions to our shareholders using cash flows from our trss the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed and income of our trss that is not distributed to the reit will not be subject to the reit income distribution requirement

to maintain our qualification as a reit we are generally required to distribute substantially all of our taxable income to our shareholders

generally reits are required to distribute 90 percent of their ordinary taxable income and 95 percent of their net capital gains income capital gains may be retained by the reit but would be subject to corporate income taxes if capital gains were retained rather than distributed our shareholders would be deemed to have received a taxable distribution about which we would notify them with a refundable credit for any federal income tax paid by the reit accordingly we believe that we are not required to distribute material amounts of cash since substantially all of our taxable income is treated as capital gains income as previously discussed in these risk factors our board of directors in its sole discretion determines the amount timing and frequency of our dividends to shareholders

changes in tax laws or their interpretation could adversely affect our shareholders and our results of operations

federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process the irs the united states department of the treasury and state taxing authorities changes to tax laws could adversely affect our shareholders or increase our effective tax rates we cannot predict with certainty whether when in what forms or with what effective dates the tax laws applicable to us or our shareholders may be changed

importexport taxes and duties

we may be required to pay significant taxes or tariffs on our exported products or countervailing and antidumping duties or tariffs on our imported products

we export logs and finished wood products to foreign markets and our ability to do so profitably is affected by us and foreign trade policy international trade disputes occur frequently and can be taken to an international trade court for resolution of unfair trade practices between countries

us international trade policy could result in one or more of our foreign export market jurisdictions adopting trade policy making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries we could therefore experience reduced revenues and margins in any of our businesses that is adversely affected by international trade tariffs duties taxes customs or dispute settlement terms to the extent such trade policies increase prices they could also reduce the demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial results and financial condition including facility closures or impairments of assets we cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any settlements of international trade disputes and their effect on our business

other risks

 

risks related to owning our stock

our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate

our board of directors in its sole discretion determines the amount and timing of our cash dividends to shareholders based on consideration of a number of factors these factors include but are not limited to our results of operations and cash flows current and forecasted economic conditions changes in the current or expected prices and demand for our products and the general market demand for timberlands including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses current and forecasted harvest levels balancing various capital allocation priorities and considerations including without limitation the company’s capital requirements and debt repayment obligations various finance considerations including the company’s credit ratings borrowing capacity debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments and other related factors and tax considerations consequently the amount timing and frequency of our dividends including our quarterly base dividend and annual supplemental dividend may fluctuate

the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors some of which are beyond our control

the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors some of which are beyond our control including without limitation those described above and elsewhere in this report as well as the following  

 



 

in addition there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies including companies operating in the forest products industry that often has been unrelated to individual company operating performance some companies that have experienced volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them if litigation of this type is brought against us it could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources

capital markets risks

deterioration in economic conditions and capital markets could adversely affect our access to capital

challenging market conditions could impair the company ’ s ability to raise debt or equity capital or otherwise access capital markets on terms acceptable to us which may among other effects reduce our ability to refinance debt maturities or take advantage of growth and expansion opportunities moreover our businesses require substantial capital for repair or replacement of existing facilities or equipment while we believe our capital resources will be adequate to meet our current projected operating needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements if for any reason we are unable to access capital for our operating needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements on acceptable economic terms or at all we could experience a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities

credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results and balance sheet actions that we take their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy ratings decisions by these agencies include maintaining upgrading or downgrading our current rating as well as placing the company on a watch list for possible future ratings actions any downgrade of our credit rating or decision by a rating agency to place us on a watch list for possible future downgrading could have an adverse effect on our ability to access credit markets increase our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities

information systems and cybersecurity

we rely on information technology to support our operations and reporting environments any failure of that technology whether by means of a security breach or other cause could affect our ability to operate our businesses effectively adversely affect our reported financial results affect our reputation and expose us to potential liability or litigation

we use information systems to carry out our operational activities maintain our business records and collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property and other proprietary and personally identifiable information some of our systems are internally managed and some are 

weyerhaeuser company  2020 annual report and form 10k 35 

 

maintained by thirdparty service providers we employ and we believe our thirdparty service providers employ what we deem to be reasonably adequate security measures but notwithstanding these efforts our systems could be compromised as a result of a cyber incident including but not limited to the occurrence in our system of malicious code such as malware viruses and ransomware a natural disaster a hardware or software corruption failure or error a telecommunications system failure a service provider failure or error an intentional or unintentional personnel action or any one or more other causes of system breach failure or disruption if by any one or more causes our systems or information resources were disrupted shutdown or otherwise compromised or if our data were destroyed misappropriated or inappropriately disclosed our financial results or our business operations or both could be negatively affected additionally we could suffer significant losses or incur significant liabilities including without limitation damage to our reputation  loss of customer confidence or goodwill and significant expenditures of time and money to address and remediate resulting damages to affected individuals or business partners or to defend ourselves in resulting litigation or other legal proceedings by affected individuals business partners or regulators

economic and market conditions affecting our operations

 

 

overview

 

in midmarch covid19 was officially declared a global pandemic by the world health organization and a national emergency was declared by the united states states and municipalities subsequently began to issue shelterinplace orders and similar mandates requiring those not engaged in essential activities to remain home the us department of homeland security designated the forest products industry as an essential critical infrastructure workforce which recognizes the importance of timber and wood products operations in supporting critical infrastructure and construction projects and the manufacture of important personal hygiene items in response to the pandemic we began taking proactive steps in early march to safeguard the health of our employees these actions include detailed cleaning and disinfecting procedures strict processes around social distancing and personal hygiene clear communication with our employees contractors vendors and visitors about our safety protocols comprehensive guidance for response to any covid19 diagnoses or exposures in our operations suspension of all air travel and nonessential meetings and a directive that employees work from home if feasible

 

based on the timing of the outbreak the economic effects of the pandemic were less pronounced in the first quarter with a drop in us gross domestic product gdp of 5 percent the effects in the second quarter were more acute with us gdp declining 31 percent in april the national unemployment rate soared to a recordhigh of nearly 15 percent driven by the restrictions imposed in response to the pandemic unemployment gradually decreased over the following two months to 13 percent in may and 11 percent in june as several states began to reopen their economies and loosen restrictions on certain sectors the rate continued to decline over the course of the third quarter ultimately falling below 8 percent in september us gdp also rebounded significantly in the third quarter with an increase of 33 percent offsetting the record decline in the prior quarter more recently economic recovery has leveled off in the fourth quarter with the unemployment rate plateauing at just below 7 percent for all three months of the quarter us gdp increased 4 percent in the fourth quarter based on the advance estimate released by the us bureau of economic analysis

 

market conditions across our businesses deteriorated rapidly in late first quarter and early second quarter 2020 but quickly rebounded as demand for housing and wood products proved resilient as the summer progressed growth in repair and remodel demand and new residential construction activity resulted in demand for wood products that significantly outpaced available supply and benchmark pricing for our commodity wood products reached record levels strong demand and pricing for our wood products continued through the back half of 2020 looking ahead to 2021 our market conditions and the strength of the broader us economy will continue to be influenced by the trajectory of us housing activity covid19 infections and the nature and extent of future government stimulus

 

business outlook

 

the demand for sawlogs within our timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of woodbased building products the strength of the us housing market especially new residential construction strongly affects demand in our wood products segment as does repair and remodeling activity our timberlands segment specifically the western region is also affected by export demand and trade policy 

weyerhaeuser company  2020 annual report and form 10k 39 

 

japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in japan the demand for pulpwood from our timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp paper and oriented strand board as well as the demand for biofuels such as pellets made from pulpwood 

full year 2020 new residential construction activity increased moderately compared with the prior year an estimated 138 million housing units were started in 2020 which is 7 percent above the 2019 total of 129 million as reported by the us census bureau single family starts totaled approximately 991 thousand units a 12 percent improvement over the 2019 total of 888 thousand multifamily starts totaled approximately 389 thousand units for 2020 which was 3 percent lower than 2019 during 2020 sales of newly built single family homes increased approximately 19 percent compared to 2019 for 2021 we anticipate approximately 145 million housing starts with the improvement driven by additional single family activity

 

in repair and remodel markets stay at home behavior has bolstered doityourself activity contributing to increased sales at building supply stores and overall repair and remodeling demand according to the census bureau advance retail spending report building material and garden supply store sales increased 13 percent in 2020 compared to 2019 evidencing the strength of the remodeling market over the course of the year

 

in us wood product markets demand and pricing for commodity products increased sharply over the second half of the year and benchmark pricing for lumber and oriented strand board reached record highs the random lengths framing lumber composite price averaged 558mbf in 2020 a 57 percent increase from the 2019 average the oriented strand board composite indicator price also increased significantly averaging 467msf in 2020 a 96 percent increase from the 2019 average

 

in western log markets douglas fir sawlog prices increased 7 percent in 2020 compared with 2019 as reported by risi log lines in the south delivered sawlog prices increased slightly compared with 2019 with a 1 percent change in price as reported by timbermartsouth our full year southern timber harvest volumes were 12 percent below 2019 harvest levels as we reduced 2020 harvest volumes in light of the economic effects of the covid19 pandemic

 

exchange rates available supply from other countries and trade policy affect our export businesses in japan total housing starts year to date through november 2020 declined 10 percent compared to the same period in 2019 a comparable decline was observed for the key post and beam segment the decline in year over year housing starts is influenced by an increase in the consumption tax which came into effect in october 2019 as well as the impacts of the covid19 pandemic

 

export log prices to china increased by 1 percent on average in 2020 over 2019 as reported by risi log lines after some initial disruption in the first quarter of the year resulting from covid19 restrictions chinese economic activity and log demand grew steadily over the remainder of the year the volume of logs imported to china from europe increased significantly in 2020 compared to 2019 which negatively affected demand for logs imported from other countries including the us

comparing 2020 with 2019

net sales

net sales increased 978 million — 15 percent — primarily due to a 1167 million increase in wood products net sales to unaffiliated customers primarily attributable to increased sales realizations across most product lines

this increase was partially offset by a 152 million decrease in timberlands net sales to unaffiliated customers primarily due to decreased sales volumes across all regions as well as a 37 million decrease in real estate  enr net sales to unaffiliated customers primarily due to a decrease in price per acre sold

costs of sales

costs of sales increased 35 million — 1 percent — primarily due to increased sales volumes across most product lines within our wood products segment and increased basis per real estate acre sold within our real estate  enr segment these increases were partially offset by decreased log sales volumes within our timberlands segment refer to additional analysis of fluctuations within our timberlands  real estate energy and natural resources and wood products discussions below 

operating income

operating income increased 1059 million — 163 percent — primarily due to

line of credit

i n january 2020 we refinanced and extended our 15 billion fiveyear senior unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in january 2025 as of december 31 2020 we had no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2019 we had 230 million of outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility we were in compliance with the revolving credit facility covenants as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019

our revolving credit agreement and our term loan agreement utilize the london interbank offered rate libor as a basis for one of the interest rate options available to the company to apply to outstanding borrowings publication of usd libor is expected to cease between january 1 2022 and july 1 2023 and we are closely monitoring ongoing market developments in the identification or creation of a widely accepted replacement rate we have included provisions in our revolving credit agreement that specifically contemplate the transition from libor to a replacement benchmark rate in july 2020 we amended our term loan agreement primarily to include provisions that address the future discontinuance of libor and set forth the process for transition to an alternate benchmark rate

as of december 31 2020 of our 55 billion longterm debt only 225 million in borrowings are governed by debt agreements that utilize libor as one of the alternative applicable rates we therefore do not believe that the discontinuation of libor as a reference rate in our debt agreements will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or materially affect our interest expense

accounting matters

 

 

critical accounting policies

in the preparation of our financial statements we follow established accounting policies and make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets liabilities revenues and expenses some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position are considered critical accounting policies

in accounting we base our judgments and estimates on 

 



actual results however may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded

our most critical accounting policies relate to our

 



 

details about our other significant accounting policies — what we use and how we estimate — are in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  

discount rates for pension and postemployment benefit plans

discount rates are used to estimate the net present value of our pension and other postemployment plan obligations these rates are determined at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of highquality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits the selection of discount rates requires judgment as well as the involvement of actuarial specialists these specialists assist with selecting yield curves based on published indices for highquality corporate bonds and projecting the timing and amount of cash flows associated with our obligations to ultimately support our determination of an appropriate discount rate for each plan

our discount rates as of december 31 2020 are

 



 

pension expenses for 2021 will be based on the 25 percent assumed discount rate for the us pension plan and the canadian pension plan and the 21 percent and 24 percent assumed discount rates for the us and canadian postemployment benefit plans respectively

our discount rates are important in determining the cost of our plans a 50 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately

 



 

impairment of longlived assets

we review the carrying value of longlived assets whenever an event or a change in circumstance indicates that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable through future operations the carrying value is the original cost less accumulated depreciation and any past impairments recorded refer to note 4 timberland acquisitions and divestitures for information on an impairment recognized in 2019 

if we evaluate recoverability we are required to estimate future cash flows and residual values of the asset or asset group key assumptions used in developing these estimates would include probability of alternative outcomes product pricing raw material cost and product sales

an impairment occurs when the carrying value of a longlived asset is greater than the amount that could be recovered from the estimated future cash flows of the asset and greater than fair market value the amount we could receive if we were to sell the asset  key assumptions used in developing estimates of fair value would include the estimated future cash flows used to assess recoverability discount rates and probability of alternative outcomes

contingent liabilities

we are subject to lawsuits investigations and other claims related to environmental product and other matters and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as the amount or range of potential loss

weyerhaeuser company  2020 annual report and form 10k 50 

 

we record contingent liabilities when 

 



 

assessing probability of loss and estimating the amount of loss can require analysis of multiple factors such as

 



 

in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred

recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain if estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we record additional charges these exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flows in any given quarter or year see note 14 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies for more information

performance measures

 

 

we use adjusted ebitda as a key performance measure to evaluate the performance of the consolidated company and our business segments this measure should not be considered in isolation from and is not intended to represent an alternative to our results reported in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap however we believe adjusted ebitda provides meaningful supplemental information for our investors about our operating performance better facilitates period to period comparisons and is widely used by analysts lenders rating agencies and other interested parties our definition of adjusted ebitda may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies adjusted ebitda as we define it is operating income adjusted for depreciation depletion amortization basis of real estate sold and special items 

 

adjusted ebitda by segment

 



 

we reconcile adjusted ebitda to net earnings for the consolidated company and to operating income for the business segments as those are the most directly comparable us gaap measures for each

competitive factors within each of our market areas generally include price species grade quality proximity to wood consuming facilities and the ability to consistently meet customer requirements we compete in the marketplace through our ability to provide customers with a consistent and reliable supply of highquality logs at scale volumes and competitive prices our customers also value our status as a sustainable forestry initiative® sfi certified supplier

sustainable forestry practices

we manage our forests intensively to maximize the value of every acre and produce a sustainable supply of wood fiber for our customers at the same time we are careful to protect biological diversity water quality and other ecosystem values our working forests also provide unique environmental cultural historical and recreational value we work hard to protect these and other qualities while still managing our forests to produce financially mature timber we follow regulatory requirements voluntary standards and certify 100 percent of our north american timberlands under the sfi forest management standard

canadian forestry operations

in canada we manage timberlands under longterm licenses that provide the primary source of the raw material for our manufacturing facilities in various provinces when we harvest trees we pay the provinces at stumpage rates set by the government we transfer logs to our manufacturing facilities at cost and do not generate any significant profit from the harvest of timber from the licensed acres in canada

timberlands products

 



 

how we measure our product

we use multiple units of measure when transacting business including





we report timberlands volumes in ton equivalents

where we do it

as of december 31 2019 we sustainably managed timberlands in 19 states this included owned or contracted acres in the following locations







in canada we manage timberlands under longterm licenses that provide raw material for our manufacturing facilities these licenses are in alberta british columbia ontario and saskatchewan

our total timber inventory — including timber on owned and contracted land — is approximately 595 million tons the amount of timber inventory does not translate into an amount of lumber or panel products because the quantity of end products varies according to the species size and quality of the timber and will change over time as these variables adjust

weyerhaeuser company  2019 annual report and form 10k 3 

 

we maintain our timber inventory in an integrated resource inventory system and geographic information system gis the resource inventory component of the system is proprietary and is largely based on internally developed methods including growth and yield models developed by our research and development organization the gis component is based on gis software that is viewed as the standard in our industry 

timber inventory data collection and verification techniques include the use of industry standard field sampling procedures as well as proprietary remote sensing technologies in some geographies the data is collected and maintained at the timber stand level

we also own and operate nurseries and seed orchards in alabama arkansas georgia louisiana mississippi oregon south carolina and washington

canada — licensed forestlands

we manage forestlands in canada under longterm licenses from the provincial governments to secure volume for our manufacturing facilities in various provinces the provincial governments regulate the volume of timber that may be harvested each year through annual allowable cuts aac which are updated every 10 years as of december 31 2019 our aac by province was









when the volume is harvested we pay the province for that volume at stumpage rates set by the government the harvested logs are transferred to our manufacturing facilities at cost stumpage plus harvest haul and overhead costs less any margin on selling logs to third parties any profit from harvesting the log through converting to finished products is recognized at the respective mill in our wood products segment

in 2019 we changed the way we report our canadian forestlands operations as a result we no longer report related intersegment sales in the timberlands segment and we now record the minimal associated thirdparty log sales in the wood products segment these collective transactions did not contribute any earnings to the timberlands or wood products segment we have conformed prior year presentations with the current year

real estate energy and natural resources

our real estate  enr segment maximizes the value of our timberland ownership through application of our asset value optimization avo process and captures the full value of surface and subsurface assets such as oil natural gas minerals and wind and solar resources

weyerhaeuser company  2019 annual report and form 10k 12 

 

what we do 

real estate

properties that exhibit higher use value than as commercial timberlands are monetized by our real estate business over time we analyze our existing us timberland holdings using a process we call avo we start with understanding the value of a parcel operating as commercial timberlands and then assess the specific real estate attributes of the parcel and its corresponding market the assessment includes demographics infrastructure and proximity to amenities and recreation to determine the potential to realize a premium value to commercial timberland attributes can evolve over time and accordingly the assignment of value and opportunity can change we continually revisit our avo assessment of all our timberland acres

these properties are acres we expect to sell for recreational conservation commercial or residential purposes over time we will entitle a small amount of acres to support development development outside of entitlement activities is typically performed by third parties some of our real estate activities are conducted through our trss

occasionally we sell a small amount of timberlands acreage in areas where we choose to reduce our market presence and capture a price that exceeds the value derivable from holding and operating as commercial timberlands these transactions will vary based on factors including the locations and physical characteristics of the timberlands

the timing of real estate sales is a function of many factors including the general state of the economy demand in local real estate markets the ability of buyers to obtain financing the number of competing properties listed for sale the seasonal nature of sales particularly in the northern states the plans of adjacent landowners our expectation of future price appreciation the timing of the harvesting activities and the availability of government and notforprofit funding in any period the average sales price per acre will vary based on the location and physical characteristics of parcels sold

energy and natural resources

we focus on maximizing potential opportunities for oil natural gas construction materials industrial minerals renewable energy including wind and solar energy rights of way easements on our timberlands portfolio and retained mineral interests

as the owner of mineral rights and interests we typically do not invest in development or operations but instead enter into contracts with operators granting them the rights to explore and sell energy and natural resources produced from our property in exchange for rents and royalties 

we generally reserve mineral rights when selling timberlands acreage some energy and natural resources activities are conducted through our trss

natural resource and environmental matters

 

we are subject to a multitude of laws and regulations in the operation of our businesses we also participate in voluntary certification of our timberlands to ensure that we sustain their overall quality including the protection of wildlife and water quality changes in law and regulation or certification standards can significantly affect our business

regulations affecting forestry practices

in the united states regulations established by federal state and local government agencies to protect water quality wetlands and other wildlife habitat could affect future harvests and forest management practices on our timberlands forest practice laws and regulations that affect present or future harvest and forest management activities in certain states include













 

each state in which we own timberlands has developed best management practices to reduce the effects of forest practices on water quality and aquatic habitats additional and more stringent regulations may be adopted by various state and local governments to achieve waterquality standards under the federal clean water act protect fish and wildlife habitats human health or achieve other public policy objectives

in canada our forest operations are carried out on public timberlands under forest licenses with the provinces all forest operations in canada are subject to





 protect environmental values and 

 encourage other stewardship values 

in canada 21 member companies of the forest products association of canada fpac including weyerhaeuser ’ s canadian subsidiary announced in may 2010 the signing of a canadian boreal forest agreement cbfa with nine environmental organizations the cbfa applies to approximately 72 million hectares of public forests licensed to fpac members and when fully implemented was expected to lead to the conservation of significant areas of canada ’ s boreal forest and protection of boreal species at risk in particular woodland caribou while the cbfa mandate came to an end in 2017 cbfa signatories continue to work on management plans with provincial governments and seek the participation of aboriginal and local communities in advancing the goals of the cbfa

endangered species protections

in the united states a number of fish and wildlife species that inhabit geographic areas near or within our timberlands have been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal endangered species act esa or similar state laws including but not limited to







additional species or populations may be listed as threatened or endangered as a result of pending or future citizen petitions or petitions initiated by federal or state agencies in addition significant citizen litigation seeks to compel the federal agencies to designate critical habitat for esalisted species and many cases have resulted in settlements under which designations will be implemented over time such designations may adversely affect some management activities and options restrictions on timber harvests can result from







such actions could increase our operating costs and affect timber supply and prices in general to date we do not believe that these measures have had and we do not believe that in 2020 they will have a significant effect on our harvesting operations we anticipate that likely future actions will not disproportionately affect weyerhaeuser as compared with comparable operations of us competitors

in canada



weyerhaeuser company  2019 annual report and form 10k 19 

 





the identification and protection of habitat and the implementation of range plans and land use action plans may over time result in additional restrictions on timber harvests and other forest management practices that could increase operating costs for operators of timberlands in canada to date we do not believe that these canadian measures have had and we do not believe that in 2020 they will have a significant effect on our harvesting operations we anticipate that likely future measures will not disproportionately affect weyerhaeuser as compared with similar operations of canadian competitors

forest certification standards

we operate in north america under the sustainable forestry initiative ® sfi this is a certification standard designed to supplement government regulatory programs with voluntary landowner initiatives to further protect certain public resources and values sfi is an independent standard overseen by a governing board consisting of









ongoing compliance with sfi may result in some increases in our operating costs and reduction of our timber harvests in some areas there is also competition from other private certification systems primarily the forest stewardship council fsc coupled with efforts by supporters to further those systems by persuading customers of forest products to require products certified to their preferred system certain features of the fsc system could impose additional operating costs on timberland management because of the considerable variation in fsc standards and variability in how those standards are interpreted and applied if sufficient marketplace demand develops for products made from raw materials sourced from other than sficertified forests we could incur substantial additional costs for operations and be required to reduce harvest levels

what these regulations and certification programs mean to us

the regulatory and nonregulatory forest management programs described above have











we believe that these regulations and programs have not had and in 2020 will not have a significant effect on our total harvest of timber in the united states or canada however these kinds of programs may have such an effect in the future we expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these programs as compared with typical owners of comparable timberlands we also expect that these programs will not significantly disrupt our planned operations over large areas or for extended periods

canadian aboriginal rights

many of the canadian timberlands are subject to the constitutionally protected treaty or commonlaw rights of aboriginal peoples of canada most of british columbia bc is not covered by treaties and as a result the claims of bc’s aboriginal peoples relating to forest resources have been largely unresolved nonetheless the supreme court of canada ruled that the tsilhqot’in nation holds aboriginal title to approximately 1900 square kilometers in bc the first time the court has declared title to exist based on historical occupation by aboriginal peoples many aboriginal groups continue to be engaged in treaty discussions with the governments of bc other provinces and canada

final or interim resolution of claims brought by aboriginal groups can be expected to result in







we believe that such claims will not have a significant effect on our total harvest of timber or production of forest products in 2020  although they may have such an effect in the future 

weyerhaeuser company  2019 annual report and form 10k 20 

 

pollutioncontrol regulations 

our operations are subject to various federal state provincial and local pollution control laws and regulations

these laws and regulations as well as market demands impose controls with regard to











compliance with these laws regulations and demands usually involves capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs we cannot easily quantify the future amounts of capital expenditures we might have to make to comply with these laws regulations and demands or the effects on our operating costs because in some instances compliance standards have not been developed or have not become final or definitive in addition it is difficult to isolate the environmental component of most manufacturing capital projects

our capital projects typically are designed to

















environmental cleanup

we are involved in the environmental investigation or remediation of numerous sites of these sites









our liability with respect to these various sites ranges from insignificant to substantial the amount of liability depends on the





we spent approximately 5 million in 2019 and expect to spend approximately 9 million in 2020 on environmental remediation of these sites

it is our policy to accrue for environmentalremediation costs when we





based on currently available information and analysis we believe it is reasonably possible that our costs to remediate all the identified sites may exceed our current accruals of 61 million by up to 124 million this estimate of the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs is much less certain than the estimates we currently are using to determine how much to accrue the estimate of the upper range also relies on assumptions less favorable to us among the range of reasonably possible outcomes

regulation of air emissions in the us

the united states environmental protection agency epa has promulgated regulations for air emissions from





these regulations cover





weyerhaeuser company  2019 annual report and form 10k 21 

 

the epa has issued several rules relating to mact standards and the emission of greenhouse gases from various energyproducing sources several court decisions have made the extent of applicability of these rules uncertain depending on the final outcomes of these decisions these regulatory programs could affect our operations by increasing the cost of purchasing electricity or from mandated energy demand reductions that could apply to our mills and other facilities that we operate the epa is also expected to issue rules relating to biomass emissions which is a significant source of energy at our mills the effect of these existing and future emissions regulations as well as related court decisions on our operations remains uncertain we continue to track and evaluate the litigation and regulatory developments but are not able to predict whether the regulations when complete and implemented will have a material effect on our operations 

to address concerns about greenhouse gases as a pollutant we









additional factors that could affect regulation of greenhouse gas emissions in the future include







we believe these developments have not had and in 2020 will not have a significant effect on our operations although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations we maintain an active forestry research program to track and understand any potential effect from actual climate change related parameters that could affect the forests we own and manage and do not anticipate any disruptions to our planned operations

regulation of air emissions in canada

our wood products facilities are regulated in canada under provincial air quality rules the canadian federal government has also proposed an air quality management system aqms as a comprehensive national approach for improving air quality in canada to go along with existing provincial air quality regulations the aqms includes











in addition to these existing and proposed regulations environment and climate change canada a canadian federal agency released the pancanadian framework on clean growth and climate change a greenhouse gas emission framework the framework put in place a national sectorbased greenhouse gas reduction program applicable to a number of industries including ours

all canadian provincial governments







along with clean air regulations british columbia a province in which we operate has adopted a carbon tax and alberta where we also have operations has a mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction regulation

although these and related regulations and measures have not had and we do not expect in 2020 that they will have a material effect on our operations they could in the future

regulation of water in the us

our operations are regulated under the clean water act which regulates the discharge of pollutants into the waters of the us this generally means obtaining permits for certain of our silviculture activities and abiding by applicable restrictions federal agency rulemaking and related litigation under the act has led to increased jurisdiction of the act by expanding the definition of waterways subject to the act’s regulation this in turn has increased the number of required federal and state permits in some areas of our operations as it relates to the application of pesticides and herbicides on timberlands which has increased operating costs pending and future federal and state rulemaking and judicial challenges thereto could make application of the clean water act as well as comparable state laws more or less costly to weyerhaeuser and we are not able to predict the final resolution of these matters although this and related regulations have not had and we do not expect in 2020 that they will have a material effect on our operations they could in the future

weyerhaeuser company  2019 annual report and form 10k 22 

 

regulation of water in canada 

changes to the canadian federal fisheries act have moved the focus of that legislation from habitat protection to fisheries protection and increased penalties we expect further changes to these regulations but we cannot predict the scope or potential effect if any on our operations although this and related canadian regulations have not had and we do not expect in 2020 that they will have a material effect on our operations they could in the future

potential changes in pollution regulation

state governments in the us continue to promulgate total maximum daily load tmdl requirements for pollutants in water bodies that do not meet state or epa water quality standards state tmdl requirements may set





moreover some states including at least two in which we operate have adopted or have introduced legislation to adopt humanhealthbased water quality standards these requirements may alter or introduce restrictions on some of our silviculture activities notably the application of pesticides and herbicides to our timberlands in some areas in canada various levels of government have been working to address water issues including use quality and management recent areas of focus include water allocation regional watershed protection protection of drinking water water pricing and a national water quality index

although these developments have not had and we do not expect in 2020 that they will have a material effect on our operations they could in the future

the overall levels of demand for the products we manufacture and distribute reflect fluctuations in levels of enduser demand which consequently affect our sales and profitability enduser demand depends in large part on general macroeconomic conditions both in the us and globally as well as on local economic conditions the length and magnitude of industry cycles vary over time both by market and by product but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions and levels of industry capacity any decline or stagnation in macroeconomic conditions could cause us to experience lower sales volume and reduced margins

commodity products

many of our products are commodities that are widely available from other producers

because commodity products have few distinguishing properties from producer to producer competition for these products is based primarily on price which is determined by supply relative to demand and competition from substitute products in addition prices for our products are affected by many other factors outside of our control as a result we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes which often are volatile our profitability with respect to these products depends in part on managing our costs particularly raw material labor including contract labor and energy costs which represent significant components of our operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control both sales and profitability of our products are subject to volatility due to market forces beyond our control

industry supply of logs and wood products

excess supply of logs and wood products may adversely affect prices and margins

our industry may increase harvest levels which could lead to an oversupply of logs wood products producers may likewise expand manufacturing capacity which could lead to an oversupply of manufactured wood products any increase of industry supply to our markets could adversely affect our prices and margins

homebuilding market and economic risks

low demand for new homes and home repair and remodeling can adversely affect our business and results of operations

our business is dependent upon the health of the us housing market and in particular on demand for new homes and home repair and remodeling demand in these markets is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as the level of employment consumer confidence consumer income the availability of financing and interest rate levels other factors that could limit or adversely affect demand for new homes and home repair and remodeling and hence demand for our products include factors such as changes in consumer preferences limited wage growth increases in nonmortgage consumer debt any weakening in consumer confidence and any increase in foreclosure rates and distress sales of houses

homebuyers’ ability to qualify for and obtain affordable mortgages could be affected by changes in interest rates changes in home loan underwriting standards and government sponsored entities and private mortgage insurance companies supporting the mortgage market

access to affordable mortgage financing is critical to the health of the us housing market generally increases in interest rates make it more difficult for home buyers to obtain mortgage financing which could negatively affect demand for housing and in turn negatively affect demand for our wood products interest rates have remained at historically low levels for an extended period of time although the us federal reserve has made both upward and downward adjustments in recent years we cannot predict the timing number extent or direction of future rate adjustments 

along with prevailing interest rates other significant factors affecting the demand for new homes relate to the ability of home buyers to obtain mortgage financing during the last us recession credit requirements for home lending were severely tightened and the number of mortgage loans available for financing home purchases were thereby severely reduced although the availability of credit has improved since that time the housing market could be limited or adversely affected if credit requirements were to again tighten or become more restrictive for any reason 

weyerhaeuser company  2019 annual report and form 10k 25 

 

additionally the liquidity provided to the mortgage industry by fannie mae and freddie mac both of which purchase home mortgages and mortgagebacked securities originated by mortgage lenders has been critical to the home lending market any political or other developments that would have the effect of limiting or restricting the availability of financing by these government sponsored entities could also adversely affect interest rates and the availability of mortgage financing whether resulting from direct increases in borrowing rates tightened underwriting standards on mortgage loans or reduced federal support of the mortgage lending industry a challenging mortgage financing environment could reduce demand for housing and therefore adversely affect demand for our products 

changes in regulations relating to tax deductions for mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes could harm our future sales and earnings

significant costs of homeownership include mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes both of which are generally deductible for an individual ’ s federal and in some cases state income taxes recent federal legislation reduced the amount of mortgage interest and real estate taxes that certain taxpayers may deduct these and any similar changes to income tax laws by the federal government or by a state government to eliminate or substantially reduce these income tax deductions or any significant increase in real property taxes by local governments may increase the cost of homeownership and thus could adversely affect the demand for our products

thirdparty service providers

we depend heavily on third parties for logging and transportation services and any increase in the cost or any disruption in the availability of these services could materially adversely affect our business and operations and our financial results

our businesses depend heavily on the availability of thirdparty service providers for the harvest of our timber and the transportation of our wood products and wood fiber we are therefore considerably affected by the availability and cost of these services any significant increase in the operating costs to our service providers including without limitation an increase in the cost of fuel or labor could have a material negative effect on our financial results by increasing the cost of these services to us as well as result in an overall reduction in the availability of these services altogether

our thirdparty transportation providers are also subject to several events outside of their control such as disruption of transportation infrastructure labor issues and natural disasters any failure of a thirdparty transportation provider to timely deliver our products including delivery of our wood products and wood fiber to our customers and delivery of wood fiber to our mills could harm our supply chain negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and our reputation

as a result of weak business conditions in the timber industry that persisted for several years there are fewer thirdparty service providers in certain markets to harvest and deliver our logs this shortage has resulted in an overall increase in logging and hauling costs and in some cases compromised the general availability of these contractors any increase in harvest levels due to positive changes in macroeconomic conditions driving demand for logs could further strain the existing supply of thirdparty logging and hauling service providers this in turn could increase the cost of log supply and delivery or prevent us from fully capitalizing on favorable market conditions by limiting our ability to access and deliver our logs to market

workforce

our business is dependent upon attracting retaining and developing key personnel 

our success depends to a significant extent upon our ability to attract retain and develop senior management operations management and other key personnel our financial condition or results of operations could be significantly adversely affected if we were to fail to recruit retain and develop such personnel or if there were to occur any significant increase in the cost of providing such personnel with competitive total compensation and benefits

a strike or other work stoppage or our inability to renew collective bargaining agreements on favorable terms could adversely affect our financial results

as of december 31 2019 a significant number of employees in our western timberlands and wood products businesses were covered by a collective bargaining agreement if these workers were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage or if our nonunionized operations were to become unionized we could experience a significant disruption of operations at our facilities or higher ongoing labor costs a significant customer or supplier strike or other work stoppage could also have similar effects on us

 

 

risks related to our business

 

managing commercial timberlands risks

our ability to harvest and deliver timber may be subject to limitations which could adversely affect our results of operations

our primary assets are our timberlands weather conditions timber growth cycles access limitations and availability of contract loggers and haulers may adversely affect our ability to harvest our timberlands other factors that may adversely affect our timber harvest include damage to our standing timber by fire or by insect infestation disease prolonged drought flooding severe weather and other natural disasters changes in global climate conditions could intensify one or more of these factors although damage from such causes usually is localized and affects only a limited percentage of standing timber there can be no assurance that any damage affecting our timberlands will in fact be limited as is common in the forest products industry we do not maintain insurance coverage for damage to our timberlands our revenues net income and cash flow 

weyerhaeuser company  2019 annual report and form 10k 26 

 

from operations are dependent to a significant extent on the pricing of our products and our continued ability to harvest timber at adequate levels therefore if we were to be restricted from harvesting on a significant portion of our timberlands for a prolonged period of time or if material damage to a significant portion of our standing timber were to occur we could suffer materially adverse effects to our results of operations 

our timber harvest levels may be affected by acquisitions of additional timberlands sales of existing timberlands and shifts in harvest from one region to another future timber harvest levels may also be affected by our ability to timely and effectively replant harvested areas which depends on several factors including changes in estimates of longterm sustainable yield because of silvicultural advances natural disasters fires pests insects and other hazards regulatory constraints availability of contractors and other factors beyond our control

timber harvest activities are also subject to a number of federal state and local regulations pertaining to the protection of fish wildlife water and other resources regulations government agency policy and guidelines and litigation can restrict timber harvest activities and increase costs examples include federal and state laws protecting threatened endangered and “atrisk” species harvesting and forestry road building activities that may be restricted under the us federal clean water act state forestry practices laws laws protecting aboriginal rights and other similar regulations

our estimates of timber inventories and growth rates may be inaccurate and include risks inherent in calculating such estimates which may impair our ability to realize expected revenues 

whether in connection with managing our existing timberland portfolio or assessing potential timberland acquisitions we make and rely on important estimates of merchantable timber inventories these include estimates of timber inventories that may be lawfully and economically harvested timber growth rates and endproduct yields timber growth rates and yield estimates are developed by forest biometricians and other experts using statistical measurements of tree samples on given property these estimates are central to forecasting our anticipated timber harvests revenues and expected cash flows while the company has confidence in its timber inventory processes and the professionals in the field who administer it future growth and yield estimates are inherently inexact and uncertain and subject to many external variables that could further affect their accuracy these include among other things disease infestation natural disasters and changes in weather patterns if these estimates are inaccurate our ability to manage our timberlands in a sustainable or profitable manner may be compromised which may cause our results of operations and our stock price to be adversely affected

our operating results and cash flows will be materially affected by supply and demand for timber

a variety of factors affect prices for timber including available supply changes in economic conditions that affect demand the level of domestic new construction and remodeling activity interest rates credit availability population growth weather conditions and pest infestation and other factors these factors vary by region by timber type ie sawlogs or pulpwood logs and by species

timber prices are affected by changes in demand on a local national and international level the closure of a mill in a region where we own timber could have a material adverse effect on demand in that region and therefore pricing for example as the demand for paper continues to decline closures of pulp mills in some of our operating regions have adversely affected the regional demand for pulpwood and wood chips additionally some of our asian log export markets particularly china have a history of significant volatility lower demand for our export logs could have a negative effect on timber prices particularly in the western region

timber prices are also affected by changes in timber supply and availability at the local national and international level our timberland ownership is concentrated in alabama arkansas louisiana mississippi north carolina oklahoma oregon and washington in some of these states much of the timberland is privately owned increases in timber prices often result in substantial increases in harvesting on private timberlands including lands not previously made available for commercial timber operations causing a shortterm increase in supply that moderates such price increases in western states such as oregon and washington where a greater proportion of timberland is governmentowned any substantial increase in timber harvesting from governmentowned land could significantly reduce timber prices on a local level timber supplies can fluctuate depending on factors such as changes in weather conditions and harvest strategies of local timberland owners as well as occasionally high timber salvage efforts due to events such as pest infestations fires or other natural disasters demand for timber in foreign markets can fluctuate due to a variety of factors as well including but not limited to changes in the fundamental economic conditions that affect demand for logs in a given export market country or region any substantial increase in supply of logs from local or regional sources including such sources that periodically supply large amounts of salvage timber as a result of disease or infestation and other factors

timberlands make up a significant portion of our business portfolio

our real property holdings are primarily timberlands and we may make additional timberlands acquisitions in the future as the owner and manager of over 11 million acres of timberlands we are subject to the risks that are inherent in concentrated real estate investments a downturn in the real estate industry generally or the timber or forest products industries specifically could reduce the value of our properties and adversely affect our results of operations such a downturn could also adversely affect our customers and reduce the demand for our products as well as our ability to execute upon our strategy of selling nonstrategic timberlands and timberland properties that have higher and better uses at attractive prices these risks may be more pronounced than if we diversified our investments outside of real property holdings

manufacturing and selling wood products risks 

a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales and negatively affect our results of operation and financial condition

any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including



























 

we cannot predict the duration of any such downtime or extent of facility damage if one of our facilities or machines were to incur significant downtime our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer demand could be impaired resulting in lower sales and income additionally we may be required to make significant unplanned capital expenditures although some risks are not insurable and some coverage is limited we purchase insurance on our manufacturing facilities for damage from fires floods windstorms earthquakes equipment failures and boiler explosions such insurance may not be sufficient to recover all of our damages

some of our wood products are vulnerable to declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials

our products compete with nonfiber based alternatives or with alternative products in certain market segments for example plastic woodplastic or composite materials may be used by builders as alternatives to our wood products such as lumber veneer plywood and oriented strand board changes in prices for oil chemicals and woodbased fiber can change the competitive position of our products relative to available alternatives and could increase substitution of those products for our products if use of these or other alternative products grows demand for and pricing of our products could be adversely affected

our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by changes in product mix or pricing

our results may be materially adversely affected by a change in our product mix or pricing some of our wood products such as lumber veneer plywood and oriented strand board are commodities and are subject to fluctuations in market pricing if pricing on our commodity products decreases and if we are not successful in increasing sales of higherpriced highervalue products or if we are not successful in implementing price increases or there are delays in acceptance of price increases or higherpriced products our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected price discounting if required to maintain our competitive position in one or more markets could result in lower than anticipated price realizations and margins

we face intense competition in our markets any failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

we compete with north american producers and for some of our product lines global producers some of which may have greater financial resources and lower production costs than do we the principal basis for competition for many of our products is selling price our industries also are particularly sensitive to other factors including innovation design quality and service with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line to the extent that any of our competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor our ability to attract and retain customers and maintain and increase sales could be materially adversely affected any failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

weyerhaeuser company  2019 annual report and form 10k 28 

 

competition from lumber imports could vary significantly and have a material effect on us lumber and timber prices 

the future amount and pricing of lumber imports entering us markets remain uncertain historically canada has been the most significant source of lumber for the us market particularly in the new home construction market we produce lumber in our canadian mills but the bulk of our lumber production is in the us there have been many disputes and subsequent trade agreements regarding sales of softwood lumber between canada and the us the last agreement which required canadian softwood lumber facilities including our mills to pay an export tax when the price of lumber is at or below a threshold price expired in october 2015 since that time the us department of commerce has issued countervailing and antidumping duties on softwood lumber imports from canada based on findings of injury to us lumber producers

we are not able to predict when or if a new softwood lumber agreement will be reached or if reached what the terms of the agreement would be similarly we are not able to predict if the current us policy of imposing import duties on canadian softwood lumber will continue we could therefore experience significant downward pressure on timber and lumber prices caused by canadian lumber imports 

another form of competition is between brands of sustainably produced products customer demand for certain brands could reduce competition among buyers for our products or cause other adverse effects

we have adopted the sustainable forestry initiative sfi standard for wood fiber supplied to our manufacturing facilities both from our timberlands and from thirdparty suppliers if customer preference for a sustainability standard other than sfi increases or if the sfi standard falls into disfavor  there may be reduced demand and lower prices for our products relative to competitors who can supply products sourced from forests certified to competing certification standards if we seek to comply with such other standards we could incur materially increased costs for our operations or be required to modify our operations such as reducing harvest levels fsc in particular employs standards that are geographically variable and could cause a material reduction in the harvest levels of some of our timberlands most notably in the pacific northwest

our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials and energy

we rely heavily on certain raw materials principally wood fiber and chemicals and energy sources principally natural gas electricity and fuel oil in our manufacturing processes our ability to increase earnings has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials and energy sources we may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material or energy costs through price increases productivity improvements costreduction programs or hedging arrangements

 

 

risks related to capital markets

 

 

capital markets

deterioration in economic conditions and capital markets could adversely affect our access to capital

challenging market conditions could impair the company ’ s ability to raise debt or equity capital or otherwise access capital markets on terms acceptable to us which may among other effects reduce our ability to refinance debt maturities or take advantage of growth and expansion opportunities likewise our customers and suppliers may be unable to raise capital to fund their operations which could in turn adversely affect their ability to purchase products or sell products to us

credit ratings

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities

credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results and balance sheet actions that we take their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy ratings decisions by these agencies include maintaining upgrading or downgrading our current rating as well as placing the company on a watch list for possible future ratings actions any downgrade of our credit rating or decision by a rating agency to place us on a watch list for possible future downgrading could have an adverse effect on our ability to access credit markets increase our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities

capital requirements and access to capital

access to capital required for our operations may be costly or impaired

our businesses require substantial capital for expansion and for repair or replacement of existing facilities or equipment although we maintain our production equipment with regular scheduled maintenance key pieces of equipment may need to be repaired or replaced periodically the costs of repairing or replacing such equipment and the associated downtime of the affected production line could have a significant effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

while we believe our capital resources will be adequate to meet our current projected operating needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements if for any reason we are unable to access capital for our operating needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements on acceptable economic terms or at all we could experience a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

weyerhaeuser company  2019 annual report and form 10k 29 

 

foreign currency 

we will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates

we have manufacturing operations in canada we are also an exporter and compete with global producers of products very similar to ours therefore we are affected by changes in the strength of the us dollar particularly relative to the canadian dollar euro yuan and yen and the strength of the euro relative to the yen changes in exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our sales volume margins and results of operations

 

 

risks related to legal regulatory and tax

 

 

environmental laws and regulations

we could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with violations of or liabilities under applicable environmental laws and other laws and regulations

we are subject to a wide range of general and industryspecific laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing























we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations and as a result of remedial obligations and there can be no assurances that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future costs we also could incur substantial costs such as civil or criminal fines sanctions and enforcement actions including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions cleanup and closure costs and thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations

as the owner and operator of real estate we may be liable under environmental laws for cleanup closure and other damages resulting from the presence and release of hazardous substances on or from our properties or operations in addition surface water management regulations may present liabilities and are subject to change the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict and in some cases our liability may exceed forecasted amounts or the value of the property itself the discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at our sites or thirdparty sites may result in significant additional costs

we also lease some of our properties to thirdparty operators for the purpose of exploring extracting developing and producing oil gas rock and other minerals in exchange for fees and royalty payments these activities are also subject to federal state and local laws and regulations these operations may create risk of environmental liabilities for any unlawful discharge of oil gas or other chemicals into the air soil or water generally these thirdparty operators indemnify us against any such liability and we require that that they maintain liability insurance during the term of our lease with them however if for any reason our thirdparty operators are not able to honor their indemnity obligation or if the required liability insurance were not in effect then it is possible that we could be deemed responsible for costs associated with environmental liability caused by such thirdparty operators

any material liability we incur as a result of activities conducted on our properties by us or by others with whom we have a business relationship could adversely affect our financial condition

we also anticipate public policy developments at the state federal and international level regarding climate change and energy access security and competitiveness we expect these developments to address emission of carbon dioxide renewable energy and fuel standards and the monetization of carbon compliance with regulations that implement new public policy in these areas might require significant expenditures these developments may also include mandated changes to energy use and building codes which could affect homebuilding practices enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretation of these laws or regulations might require significant expenditures we also anticipate public policy developments at the state federal and international level regarding taxes and a number of other areas that could require significant expenditures

changes in global or regional climate conditions and governmental response to such changes at the international us federal and state levels may affect our operations or our planned or future growth activities

there continue to be numerous international us federal and statelevel initiatives and proposals to address domestic and global climate issues within the us and canada some of these proposals would regulate and in some canadian provinces do regulate andor tax the 

weyerhaeuser company  2019 annual report and form 10k 30 

 

production of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to facilitate the reduction of carbon compound emissions into the atmosphere and provide tax and other incentives to produce and use cleaner energy climate change effects if they occur and governmental initiatives laws and regulations to address potential climate concerns could increase our costs and have a longterm adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations future legislation or regulatory activity in this area remains uncertain and its effect on our operations is unclear at this time however it is possible that legislation or government mandates standards or regulations intended to mitigate or reduce carbon compound or greenhouse gas emissions or other climate change effects could adversely affect our operations for example such activities could limit harvest levels or result in significantly higher costs for energy and other raw materials because our manufacturing operations depend upon significant amounts of energy and raw materials these initiatives could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability 

legal matters

we are involved in various environmental regulatory product liability and other legal matters disputes and proceedings that if determined or concluded in a manner adverse to our interests could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition

we are from time to time involved in a number of legal matters disputes and proceedings legal matters some of which involve ongoing litigation these include without limitation legal matters involving environmental cleanup and remediation warranty and nonwarranty product liability claims regulatory issues contractual and personal injury claims and other legal matters in some cases all or a portion of any loss we experience in connection with any such legal matters will be covered by insurance in other cases any such losses will not be covered

the outcome costs and other effects of current legal matters in which we are involved and any related insurance recoveries cannot be determined with certainty although the disclosures in note 14 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies and note 21 income taxes contain management ’ s current views of the effect such legal matters could have on our financial results there can be no assurance that the outcome of such legal matters will be as currently expected it is possible that there could be adverse judgments against us in some or all major litigation matters against us and that we could be required to take a charge and make cash payments for all or a portion of any related awards of damages any one or more of such charges or cash payment could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows for the quarter or year in which we record or pay it

reit status and tax implications

if we fail to remain qualified as a reit our taxable income would be subject to tax at corporate rates and we would not be able to deduct dividends to shareholders

in any taxable year in which we fail to qualify as a reit unless we are entitled to relief under the internal revenue code







qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code to our operations and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions although we operate in a manner consistent with the reit qualification rules we cannot assure you that we are or will remain so qualified

certain of our business activities are subject to corporatelevel income tax and potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax

under the internal revenue code reits generally must engage in the ownership and management of income producing real estate for the company this generally includes owning and managing a timberland portfolio for the production and sale of standing timber any activities that generate nonqualifying reit income could constitute “prohibited transactions” prohibited transactions are defined by the internal revenue code generally to be sales or other dispositions of property to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business accordingly the harvesting and sale of logs the development or sale of certain timberlands and other real estate and the manufacture and sale of wood products are conducted through one or more of our whollyowned trss the net income of which is subject to corporatelevel tax by conducting our business in this manner we believe that we satisfy the reit requirements of the internal revenue code however if the irs were to successfully assert that these or any of our activities conducted at the reit constituted prohibited transactions we could be subject to the 100 percent tax on the net income from such activities

the extent of our use of our trss may affect the price of our common shares relative to the share price of other reits

we conduct a significant portion of our business activities through one or more trss the use of our trss enables us to engage in nonreit qualifying business activities such as the harvesting and sale of logs manufacture and sale of wood products and the development and sale of certain higher and better use hbu property our trss are subject to corporatelevel income tax under the code no more than 20 percent of the value of the gross assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss this limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our trss’ operations furthermore our use of trss may cause the market to value our common shares differently than the shares of other reits which may not use trss at all or as extensively as we use them

we may be limited in our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our trss

the ability of the reit to receive dividends from our trss is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a reit in particular at least 75 percent of gross income for each taxable year as a reit must be derived from real estate sources including sales of our standing timber and other types of qualifying real estate income and no more than 25 percent of our gross income may consist of dividends from our trss and other nonreal estate income

weyerhaeuser company  2019 annual report and form 10k 31 

 

this limitation on our ability to receive dividends from our trss may affect our ability to fund cash distributions to our shareholders using cash flows from our trss the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed and income of our trss that is not distributed to the reit will not be subject to the reit income distribution requirement 

to maintain our qualification as a reit we are generally required to distribute substantially all of our taxable income to our shareholders  

generally reits are required to distribute 90 percent of their ordinary taxable income and 95 percent of their net capital gains income capital gains may be retained by the reit but would be subject to corporate income taxes if capital gains were retained rather than distributed our shareholders would be deemed to have received a taxable distribution about which we would notify them with a refundable credit for any federal income tax paid by the reit accordingly we believe that we are not required to distribute material amounts of cash since substantially all of our taxable income is treated as capital gains income as previously discussed in these risk factors our board of directors in its sole discretion determines the amount timing and frequency of our dividends to shareholders

changes in tax laws or their interpretation could adversely affect our shareholders and our results of operations

federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process the internal revenue service the united states department of the treasury and state taxing authorities changes to tax laws could adversely affect our shareholders or increase our effective tax rates we cannot predict with certainty whether when in what forms or with what effective dates the tax laws applicable to us or our shareholders may be changed

importexport taxes and duties

we may be required to pay significant taxes or tariffs on our exported products or countervailing and antidumping duties or tariffs on our imported products

we export logs and finished wood products to foreign markets and our ability to do so profitably is affected by us and foreign trade policy international trade disputes occur frequently and can be taken to an international trade court for resolution of unfair trade practices between countries

us international trade policy could result in one or more of our foreign export market jurisdictions adopting trade policy making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries we could therefore experience reduced revenues and margins in any of our businesses that is adversely affected by international trade tariffs duties taxes customs or dispute settlement terms to the extent such trade policies increase prices they could also reduce the demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial results and financial condition including facility closures or impairments of assets we cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any settlements of international trade disputes and their effect on our business

our merger with plum creek timber company inc

we could incur substantial us federal tax liability in connection with our merger with plum creek

on february 19 2016 plum creek timber company inc merged with and into weyerhaeuser company with weyerhaeuser continuing as the surviving company both companies have operated in a manner intended to qualify them as “reits” for us federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code see “reit status and tax implications” above for a description of the consequences of our failure to maintain reit status however even if we have operated in a manner that allows us to retain our reit status if plum creek were deemed to have lost its reit status for a taxable year before the merger or the taxable year in which the merger occurred we could face serious tax consequences that could substantially reduce cash available for distribution to our shareholders and significantly impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital in addition if the merger were determined not to qualify as a taxfree merger we could incur substantial federal tax liability that could materially and adversely affect the companys cash flows financial condition and results of operations

 

 

risks related to our stock 

 

 

the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors some of which are beyond our control

the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors some of which are beyond our control including without limitation those described above and elsewhere in this report as well as the following

weyerhaeuser company  2019 annual report and form 10k 32 

 

























in addition there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in the forest products industry that often has been unrelated to individual company operating performance some companies that have experienced volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them if litigation of this type is brought against us it could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources

our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate

our board of directors in its sole discretion determines the amount of quarterly dividends to be provided to our shareholders based on consideration of a number of factors these factors include but are not limited to our results of operations and cash flow current and forecasted economic conditions changes in the price and demand for our products and the general market demand for timberlands including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses current and forecasted harvest levels balancing various capital allocation priorities and considerations including without limitation the company’s capital requirements and debt repayment obligations various finance considerations including the company’s credit ratings borrowing capacity debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments and other related factors and tax considerations consequently the amount timing and frequency of our dividends may fluctuate

 

 

other risks

 

 

information systems and cybersecurity

we rely on information technology to support our operations and reporting environments any failure of that technology whether by means of a security breach or other cause could affect our ability to operate our businesses effectively adversely affect our reported financial results affect our reputation and expose us to potential liability or litigation

we use information systems to carry out our operational activities maintain our business records and collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property and other proprietary and personally identifiable information some of our systems are internally managed and some are maintained by thirdparty service providers we employ and we believe our thirdparty service providers employ what we deem to be reasonably adequate security measures but notwithstanding these efforts our systems could be compromised as a result of a cyber incident including but not limited to the occurrence in our system of malicious code such as malware viruses and ransomware a natural disaster a hardware or software corruption failure or error a telecommunications system failure a service provider failure or error an intentional or unintentional personnel action or any one or more other causes of system breach failure or disruption if by any one or more causes our systems or information resources were disrupted shutdown or otherwise compromised or if our data were destroyed misappropriated or inappropriately disclosed our financial results or our business operations or both could be negatively affected additionally we could suffer significant losses or incur significant liabilities including without limitation damage to our reputation loss of customer confidence or goodwill and significant expenditures of time and money to address and remediate resulting damages to affected individuals or business partners or to defend ourselves in resulting litigation or other legal proceedings by affected individuals business partners or regulators

pension plan liability

investment returns on our pension assets may be lower than expected or interest rates may decline requiring us to make significant additional cash contributions to our benefit plans

a portion of our current and former employees have accrued benefits under our defined benefit pension plans although the plans are not open to employees hired on or after january 1 2014 current employees hired before that time continue to accrue benefits requirements for funding our pension plan liabilities are based on a number of actuarial assumptions including the expected rate of return on our plan assets and the discount rate applied to our pension plan obligations fluctuations in equity market returns and changes in longterm interest rates could increase our costs under our defined benefit pension plans and may significantly affect future contribution requirements it is unknown what the actual investment return on our pension assets will be in future years and what interest rates may be at any given point in time we cannot therefore provide any assurance of what our actual pension plan costs will be in the future or whether we will be required under applicable law to make future material plan contributions see note 9 pension and other postretirement benefit plans for additional information about these plans including funding status

real estate energy and natural resources 

our real estate  enr segment maximizes the value of our timberland ownership through application of our asset value optimization avo process and captures the full value of surface and subsurface assets such as oil natural gas minerals and wind and solar resources 

what we do 

real estate 

properties that exhibit higher use value than as commercial timberlands are monetized by our real estate business over time we analyze our existing us timberland holdings using a process we call avo we start with understanding the value of a parcel operating as commercial timberlands and then assess the specific real estate attributes of the parcel and its corresponding market the assessment includes demographics infrastructure and proximity to amenities and recreation to determine the potential to realize a premium value to commercial timberland attributes can evolve over time and accordingly the assignment of value and opportunity can change we continually revisit our avo assessment of all of our timberland acres 

these properties are acres we expect to sell for recreational conservation commercial or residential purposes over time we will entitle a small amount of acres to support development development outside of entitlement activities is typically performed by third parties some of our real estate activities are conducted through our taxable reit subsidiary 

occasionally we sell a small amount of timberlands acreage in areas where we choose to reduce our market presence and we can capture a price that exceeds the value derivable from holding and operating as commercial timberlands these transactions will vary based on factors including the locations and physical characteristics of the timberlands 

the timing of real estate sales is a function of many factors including the general state of the economy demand in local real estate markets the ability of buyers to obtain financing the number of competing properties listed for sale the seasonal nature of sales particularly in the northern states the plans of adjacent landowners our expectation of future price appreciation the timing of the harvesting activities and the availability of government and notforprofit funding in any period the average sales price per acre will vary based on the location and physical characteristics of parcels sold 

energy and natural resources 

we focus on maximizing potential opportunities for oil natural gas construction materials industrial minerals coal renewable energy and rights of way easements on our timberlands portfolio and retained mineral interests 

as the owner of mineral rights and interests we typically do not invest in development or operations but instead enter into contracts with operators granting them the rights to explore and sell energy and natural resources produced from our property in exchange for rents and royalties our primary sources of revenue are 

 we generally reserve mineral rights when selling timberlands acreage some energy and natural resources activities are conducted through our taxable reit subsidiary 

real estate energy and natural resources sources of revenue

we are subject to a multitude of laws and regulations in the operation of our businesses we also participate in voluntary certification of our timberlands to ensure that we sustain their overall quality including the protection of wildlife and water quality changes in law and regulation or certification standards can significantly affect our business 

regulations affecting forestry practices 

in the united states regulations established by federal state and local government agencies to protect water quality wetlands and other wildlife habitat could affect future harvests and forest management practices on our timberlands forest practice laws and regulations that affect present or future harvest and forest management activities in certain states include 

 each state in which we own timberlands has developed best management practices to reduce the effects of forest practices on water quality and aquatic habitats additional and more stringent regulations may be adopted by various state and local governments to achieve waterquality standards under the federal clean water act protect fish and wildlife habitats human health or achieve other public policy objectives 

in canada our forest operations are carried out on public timberlands under forest licenses with the provinces all forest operations in canada are subject to 

    protect environmental values and 

    encourage other stewardship values 

in canada 21 member companies of the forest products association of canada fpac including weyerhaeuser ’ s canadian subsidiary announced in may 2010 the signing of a canadian boreal forest agreement cbfa with nine environmental organizations the cbfa applies to approximately 72 million hectares of public forests licensed to fpac members and when fully implemented was expected to lead to the conservation of significant areas of canada ’ s boreal forest and protection of boreal species at risk in particular woodland caribou while the cbfa mandate came to an end in 2017 cbfa signatories continue to work on management plans with provincial governments and seek the participation of aboriginal and local communities in advancing the goals of the cbfa 

endangered species protections 

in the united states a number of fish and wildlife species that inhabit geographic areas near or within our timberlands have been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal endangered species act esa or similar state laws including but not limited to 

 additional species or populations may be listed as threatened or endangered as a result of pending or future citizen petitions or petitions initiated by federal or state agencies in addition significant citizen litigation seeks to compel the federal agencies to designate critical habitat for esalisted species and many cases have resulted in settlements under which designations will be implemented over time such designations may adversely affect some management activities and options restrictions on timber harvests can result from 

 

such actions could increase our operating costs and affect timber supply and prices in general to date we do not believe that these measures have had and we do not believe that in 2019  they will have a significant effect on our harvesting operations we anticipate that likely future actions will not disproportionately affect weyerhaeuser as compared with comparable operations of us competitors 

in canada 

 

  weyerhaeuser company  2018 annual report and form 10k   19 

                      

the identification and protection of habitat and the implementation of range plans and land use action plans may over time result in additional restrictions on timber harvests and other forest management practices that could increase operating costs for operators of timberlands in canada to date we do not believe that these canadian measures have had and we do not believe that in 2019  they will have a significant effect on our harvesting operations we anticipate that likely future measures will not disproportionately affect weyerhaeuser as compared with similar operations of canadian competitors 

forest certification standards 

we operate in north america under the sustainable forestry initiative ® sfi this is a certification standard designed to supplement government regulatory programs with voluntary landowner initiatives to further protect certain public resources and values sfi is an independent standard overseen by a governing board consisting of 

 ongoing compliance with sfi may result in some increases in our operating costs and reduction of our timber harvests in some areas there is also competition from other private certification systems primarily the forest stewardship council fsc coupled with efforts by supporters to further those systems by persuading customers of forest products to require products certified to their preferred system certain features of the fsc system could impose additional operating costs on timberland management because of the considerable variation in fsc standards and variability in how those standards are interpreted and applied if sufficient marketplace demand develops for products made from raw materials sourced from other than sficertified forests we could incur substantial additional costs for operations and be required to reduce harvest levels 

what these regulations and certification programs mean to us 

the regulatory and nonregulatory forest management programs described above have 

 we believe that these regulations and programs have not had and in 2019  will not have a significant effect on our total harvest of timber in the united states or canada however these kinds of programs may have such an effect in the future we expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these programs as compared with typical owners of comparable timberlands we also expect that these programs will not significantly disrupt our planned operations over large areas or for extended periods 

canadian aboriginal rights 

many of the canadian timberlands are subject to the constitutionally protected treaty or commonlaw rights of aboriginal peoples of canada most of british columbia bc is not covered by treaties and as a result the claims of bc’s aboriginal peoples relating to forest resources have been largely unresolved on june 26 2014 the supreme court of canada ruled that the tsilhqot’in nation holds aboriginal title to approximately 1900 square kilometers in bc this was the first time that the court has declared title to exist based on historical occupation by aboriginal peoples many aboriginal groups continue to be engaged in treaty discussions with the governments of bc other provinces and canada 

final or interim resolution of claims brought by aboriginal groups can be expected to result in 

 we believe that such claims will not have a significant effect on our total harvest of timber or production of forest products in 2019  although they may have such an effect in the future in 2008 fpac of which we are a member signed a memorandum of understanding with the assembly of first nations under which the parties agree to work together to strengthen canada ’ s forest sector through economicdevelopment initiatives and business investments strong environmental stewardship and the creation of skilldevelopment opportunities particularly targeted to aboriginal youth 

pollutioncontrol regulations 

our operations are subject to various laws and regulations including federal state provincial and local pollution controls 

these laws and regulations as well as market demands impose controls with regard to 



  weyerhaeuser company  2018 annual report and form 10k   20 

                      

compliance with these laws regulations and demands usually involves capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs we cannot easily quantify the future amounts of capital expenditures we might have to make to comply with these laws regulations and demands or the effects on our operating costs because in some instances compliance standards have not been developed or have not become final or definitive in addition it is difficult to isolate the environmental component of most manufacturing capital projects 

our capital projects typically are designed to 

 

environmental cleanup 

we are involved in the environmental investigation or remediation of numerous sites of these sites 

 our liability with respect to these various sites ranges from insignificant to substantial the amount of liability depends on the 

 we spent approximately 13 million  in 2018  and expect to spend approximately 6 million  in 2019  on environmental remediation of these sites 

it is our policy to accrue for environmentalremediation costs when we 

 we currently believe it is reasonably possible that our costs to remediate all the identified sites may exceed our current accruals of 62 million  based on currently available information and analysis remediation costs for all identified sites may exceed our existing reserves by up to 126 million  this estimate of the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs is much less certain than the estimates we currently are using to determine how much to accrue the estimate of the upper range also uses assumptions less favorable to us among the range of reasonably possible outcomes 

regulation of air emissions in the us 

the united states environmental protection agency epa has promulgated regulations for air emissions from 

 these regulations cover 

 between 2011 and 2015 the epa issued three related portions of new mact standards for industrial boilers and process heaters in july 2016 a court decision was issued that requires epa to reissue certain of the emissions standards some of these reissued emissions standards will be applicable to a small number of our wood products mills because we do not know specifically how or when the epa will implement the final court decision we cannot predict whether or when the emission standard revisions may have a material effect on regulatory compliance costs at our mills we do not expect any material expenditures in 2019 necessary to comply with mact standards 

the epa must still promulgate supplemental mact standards for plywood lumber and composite wood products facilities 

we cannot currently quantify the amount of capital we will need in the future to comply with new regulations being developed by the epa because final rules have not been promulgated 

in 2010 the epa issued a final greenhouse gas rule limiting the growth of emissions from new projects meeting certain thresholds on june 23 2014 the us supreme court issued a decision that removed potential applicability of the underlying 2010 regulations based solely on greenhouse gas emissions and limited application of the rule’s technology requirements to larger emission sources as a result of new emissions from nongreenhouse gas pollutants as a result of this supreme court ruling epa proposed a new regulation in 2016 to set thresholds for when the greenhouse gas technology requirements apply if the nongreenhouse gas emissions trigger the rule in the first instance epa to date has not finalized this regulation the effect of the supreme court ruling is to end the potential applicability of the technology requirements for our smaller manufacturing operations and limit the applicability for our other operations 

in 2015 the epa issued an extensive regulatory program for new and existing electric utility generating units to scale back emissions of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide co2 arising from fossil fuel use to generate electricity epa also proposed additional supplemental regulations related to how states and federal agencies may implement the requirements finalized in 2015 subsequent actions include in 2016 a us supreme court stay of the 2015 rule pending resolution of lower court challenges to the rule in 2017 the withdrawal by epa of the proposed supplemental regulations and a proposal to rescind the 2015 final rule and in 2018 an epa proposal of a substantially different replacement rule depending on the final outcomes this regulatory program potentially will have indirect effects on our operations such as from rising purchased electricity prices or from mandated energy demand reductions that could apply to our mills and other facilities that we operate we continue to track and evaluate the litigation and regulatory development but are not able to predict whether the regulations when complete and implemented will have a material effect on our operations 

  weyerhaeuser company  2018 annual report and form 10k   21 

                      

we use significant biomass for energy production at our mills epa is currently working on rules regarding regulation of biomass emissions 

the effect of these greenhouse gas and biomass rules as well as recent court decisions on our operations remains uncertain 

to address concerns about greenhouse gases as a pollutant we 

 additional factors that could affect regulation of greenhouse gas emissions in the future include 

 we believe these developments have not had and in 2019  will not have a significant effect on our operations although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations we maintain an active forestry research program to track and understand any potential effect from actual climate change related parameters that could affect the forests we own and manage and do not anticipate any disruptions to our planned operations 

regulation of air emissions in canada 

in addition to existing provincial air quality regulations the canadian federal government has proposed an air quality management system aqms as a comprehensive national approach for improving air quality in canada the federal proposed aqms includes 

 in 2016 environment canada released the pancanadian framework on clean growth and climate change a greenhouse gas emission framework the framework put in place a national sectorbased greenhouse gas reduction program applicable to a number of industries including ours 

all canadian provincial governments 

 in addition british columbia has adopted a carbon tax and alberta has a mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction regulation 

we believe these measures have not had and in 2019  will not have a significant effect on our operations although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations we also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations 

regulation of water 

in the us as a result of litigation under the federal clean water act additional federal or state permits are now required in some states for the application of pesticides including herbicides on timberlands those permits have entailed payment of additional costs in 2015 federal regulatory agencies adopted rules that potentially expand the definition of waters subject to federal clean water act jurisdiction which could increase the scope and number of permits required for forestryrelated activities and entail additional costs for weyerhaeuser and other forest landowners in the us those rules were challenged in various federal courts by numerous parties and states and a nationwide injunction was issued against the rule by the sixth circuit court of appeals but was dissolved in 2018 due to action by the us supreme court other injunctions still block the rule in several states in january 2018 federal agencies took regulatory action to further delay the 2015 rules from going into effect until february 2020 however that action was enjoined in september 2018 by a south carolina court challenges to the substance of the 2015 rule are being pursued in other pending cases challenging the 2015 rules meanwhile the federal agencies have proposed repeal of the 2015 rules entirely and replacement of them with a new rule which is now open for public comment we are not able to predict the ultimate resolution of these pending legal and regulatory actions 

in 2016 washington state department of ecology wa doe adopted human healthbased water quality criteria the epa subsequently promulgated its own water quality standards for washington state for the protection of human health for certain pollutants it is unclear what effect if any these rules will have on our manufacturing operations in washington state 

in addition in 2013 amendments to the canadian federal fisheries act came into force these amendments changed the focus from habitat protection to fisheries protection and increased penalties we expect further changes to these regulations subsequent to review and regulatory consultations that took place in 2016 but we cannot predict the scope or potential effect if any on our operations 

we believe the above developments have not had and in 2019  will not have a significant effect on our operations although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations we also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations

potential changes in pollution regulation 

state governments continue to promulgate total maximum daily load tmdl requirements for pollutants in water bodies that do not meet state or epa water quality standards state tmdl requirements may set 

 it is not possible to estimate the capital expenditures that may be required for us to meet pollution allocations across the various proposed state tmdl programs until a specific tmdl is promulgated 

in canada various levels of government have been working to address water issues including use quality and management recent areas of focus include water allocation regional watershed protection protection of drinking water water pricing and a national water quality index

  weyerhaeuser company  2018 annual report and form 10k   24 




 

                      

risk factors 

we are subject to various risks and events that could adversely affect our business our financial condition our results of operations our cash flows and the price of our common stock 

you should consider the following risk factors in addition to the information presented elsewhere in this report particularly in our business  who we are  our business  what we do  our business  natural resources and environmental matters  forwardlooking statements  and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as in the filings we make from time to time with the sec in evaluating us our business and an investment in our securities 

the risks discussed below are not the only risks we face additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely affect our business 



macroeconomic conditions 

the industries in which we operate are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions and consequently are highly cyclical 

the overall levels of demand for the products we manufacture and distribute reflect fluctuations in levels of enduser demand which consequently affect our sales and profitability enduser demand depends in large part on general macroeconomic conditions both in the us and globally as well as on local economic conditions current economic conditions in the united states reflect growth enhanced by tax cuts passed in 2018 the effect of which may be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and other factors in 2019 global economic conditions reflect volatile and sporadic growth in emerging countries and uncertainty over international trade the length and magnitude of industry cycles vary over time both by market and by product but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions and levels of industry capacity any decline or stagnation in macroeconomic conditions could cause us to experience lower sales volume and reduced margins 

commodity products 

many of our products are commodities that are widely available from other producers 

because commodity products have few distinguishing properties from producer to producer competition for these products is based primarily on price which is determined by supply relative to demand and competition from substitute products in addition prices for our products are affected by many other factors outside of our control as a result we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes which often are volatile our profitability with respect to these products depends in part on managing our costs particularly raw material labor including contract labor and energy costs which represent significant components of our operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control both sales and profitability of our products are subject to volatility due to market forces beyond our control 

industry supply of logs and wood products 

excess supply of logs and wood products may adversely affect prices and margins 

our industry may increase harvest levels which could lead to an oversupply of logs wood products producers may likewise expand manufacturing capacity which could lead to an oversupply of manufactured wood products any increase of industry supply to our markets could adversely affect our prices and margins 

homebuilding market and economic risks 

high unemployment low demand and low levels of consumer confidence can adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our business is dependent upon the health of the us housing market demand for homes is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as the level of employment consumer confidence consumer income the availability of financing and interest rate levels other factors that could limit or adversely affect demand for new homes and hence demand for our products include factors such as limited wage growth increases in nonmortgage consumer debt any weakening in consumer confidence and any increase in foreclosure rates and distress sales of houses 

homebuyers’ ability to qualify for and obtain affordable mortgages could be affected by changes in interest rates changes in home loan underwriting standards and government sponsored entities and private mortgage insurance companies supporting the mortgage market 

access to affordable mortgage financing is critical to the health of the us housing market generally increases in interest rates make it more difficult for home buyers to obtain mortgage financing which could negatively affect demand for housing and in turn negatively affect demand for our wood products after an extended period during which the us federal reserve kept its benchmark interest rate at historically low levels it began raising rates again in 2016 and continued through 2018 the number and extent of further rate increases is uncertain 

credit requirements were severely tightened and the number of mortgage loans available for financing home purchases were severely reduced during the most recent recession and ensuing credit crisis although the availability of credit has improved modestly since that time the demand for new homes could be limited or adversely affected if credit requirements were to again tighten or become more restrictive for any reason 

the liquidity provided to the mortgage industry by fannie mae and freddie mac both of which purchase home mortgages and mortgagebacked securities originated by mortgage lenders has been critical to the housing market any political or other developments that would have the effect of limiting or restricting the availability of financing by these government sponsored entities could also adversely affect interest rates and the availability of mortgage financing whether resulting from direct increases in borrowing rates tightened underwriting standards on mortgage loans or reduced federal support of the mortgage lending industry a challenging mortgage financing environment could reduce demand for housing and therefore adversely affect demand for our products 

  weyerhaeuser company  2018 annual report and form 10k   25 

                      

changes in regulations relating to tax deductions for mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes could harm our future sales and earnings 

significant costs of homeownership include mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes both of which are generally deductible for an individual ’ s federal and in some cases state income taxes recent federal legislation reduced the amount of mortgage interest and real estate taxes that certain taxpayers may deduct these and any similar changes to income tax laws by the federal government or by a state government to eliminate or substantially reduce these income tax deductions or any significant increase in real property taxes by local governments may increase the cost of homeownership and thus could adversely affect the demand for our products 

transportation 

we depend on third parties for transportation services and any disruptions in the availability of transportation or increases in transportation costs could materially adversely affect our business and operations 

our business depends heavily on the availability of thirdparty service providers for the transportation of our wood products and wood fiber we are therefore materially affected by the availability and cost of these services any significant increase in the operating costs to our service providers including without limitation the cost of fuel or labor could have a material negative effect on our financial results by increasing the cost of these services to us as well as result in an overall reduction in the availability of these services altogether 

our thirdparty transportation providers are also subject to several events outside of their control such as disruption of transportation infrastructure labor issues and natural disasters any failure of a thirdparty transportation provider to timely deliver our products including delivery of our wood products and wood fiber to our customers and delivery of wood fiber to our mills could harm our supply chain negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and our reputation 



managing commercial timberlands risks 

our ability to harvest and deliver timber may be subject to limitations which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our primary assets are our timberlands weather conditions timber growth cycles access limitations and availability of contract loggers and haulers may adversely affect our ability to harvest our timberlands other factors that may adversely affect our timber harvest include damage to our standing timber by fire or by insect infestation disease prolonged drought flooding severe weather and other natural disasters changes in global climate conditions could intensify one or more of these factors although damage from such causes usually is localized and affects only a limited percentage of standing timber there can be no assurance that any damage affecting our timberlands will in fact be limited as is common in the forest products industry we do not maintain insurance coverage for damage to our timberlands our revenues net income and cash flow from operations are dependent to a significant extent on the pricing of our products and our continued ability to harvest timber at adequate levels therefore if we were to be restricted from harvesting on a significant portion of our timberlands for a prolonged period of time or if material damage to a significant portion of our standing timber were to occur we could suffer materially adverse effects to our results of operations 

our timber harvest levels may be affected by acquisitions of additional timberlands sales of existing timberlands and shifts in harvest from one region to another future timber harvest levels may also be affected by our ability to timely and effectively replant harvested areas which depends on several factors including changes in estimates of longterm sustainable yield because of silvicultural advances natural disasters fires pests insects and other hazards regulatory constraints availability of logging contractors and other factors beyond our control 

timber harvest activities are also subject to a number of federal state and local regulations pertaining to the protection of fish wildlife water and other resources regulations reinterpretations and litigation can restrict timber harvest activities and increase costs examples include federal and state laws protecting threatened endangered and “atrisk” species harvesting and forestry road building activities that may be restricted under the us federal clean water act state forestry practices laws laws protecting aboriginal rights and other similar regulations 

our estimates of timber inventories and growth rates may be inaccurate and include risks inherent in calculating such estimates which may impair our ability to realize expected revenues 

whether in connection with managing our existing timberland portfolio or assessing potential timberland acquisitions we make and rely on important estimates of merchantable timber inventories these include estimates of timber inventories that may be lawfully and economically harvested timber growth rates and endproduct yields timber growth rates and yield estimates are developed by forest biometricians and other experts using statistical measurements of tree samples on given property these estimates are central to forecasting our anticipated timber harvests revenues and expected cash flows while the company has confidence in its timber inventory processes and the professionals in the field who administer it growth and yield estimates are inherently inexact and uncertain if these estimates are inaccurate our ability to manage our timberlands in a sustainable or profitable manner may be compromised which may cause our results of operations and our stock price to be adversely affected 

our operating results and cash flows will be materially affected by supply and demand for timber 

a variety of factors affect prices for timber including available supply changes in economic conditions that affect demand the level of domestic new construction and remodeling activity interest rates credit availability population growth weather conditions and pest infestation and other factors these factors vary by region by timber type ie sawlogs or pulpwood logs and by species 

timber prices are affected by changes in demand on a local national and international level the closure of a mill in a region where we own timber could have a material adverse effect on demand in that region and therefore pricing for example as the demand for paper continues to decline closures of pulp mills in some of our operating regions have adversely affected the regional demand for pulpwood and wood chips another example involves our export of logs to asia while recent demand from asian markets has remained steady some asian markets particularly in china have a history of significant volatility a decrease in demand for logs from one or more asian markets could have a negative effect on log and lumber prices 

timber prices are also affected by changes in timber availability at the local national and international level our timberland ownership is concentrated in alabama arkansas louisiana mississippi north carolina oklahoma oregon and washington in some of these states much

of the timberland is privately owned increases in timber prices often result in substantial increases in harvesting on private timberlands including lands not previously made available for commercial timber operations causing a shortterm increase in supply that moderates such price increases in western states such as oregon and washington where a greater proportion of timberland is governmentowned any substantial increase in timber harvesting from governmentowned land could significantly reduce timber prices any decrease in the demand from our log export markets could also result in significant downward pressure on timber prices particularly in the western region on a local level timber supplies can fluctuate depending on factors such as changes in weather conditions and harvest strategies of local timberland owners as well as occasionally high timber salvage efforts due to events such as pest infestations fires or other natural disasters 

timberlands make up a significant portion of our business portfolio 

our real property holdings are primarily timberlands and we may make additional timberlands acquisitions in the future as the owner and manager of approximately 122 million  acres of timberlands we are subject to the risks that are inherent in concentrated real estate investments a downturn in the real estate industry generally or the timber or forest products industries specifically could reduce the value of our properties and adversely affect our results of operations such a downturn could also adversely affect our customers and reduce the demand for our products as well as our ability to execute upon our strategy of selling nonstrategic timberlands and timberland properties that have higher and better uses at attractive prices these risks may be more pronounced than if we diversified our investments outside of real property holdings 

manufacturing and selling wood products risks 

a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales and negatively affect our results of operation and financial condition 

any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

 we cannot predict the duration of any such downtime or extent of facility damage if one of our facilities or machines were to incur significant downtime our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer demand could be impaired resulting in lower sales and income additionally we may be required to make significant unplanned capital expenditures although some risks are not insurable and some coverage is limited we purchase insurance on our manufacturing facilities for damage from fires floods windstorms earthquakes equipment failures and boiler explosions such insurance may not be sufficient to recover all of our damages 

some of our wood products are vulnerable to declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials 

our products compete with nonfiber based alternatives or with alternative products in certain market segments for example plastic woodplastic or composite materials may be used by builders as alternatives to our wood products such as lumber veneer plywood and oriented strand board changes in prices for oil chemicals and woodbased fiber can change the competitive position of our products relative to available alternatives and could increase substitution of those products for our products if use of these or other alternative products grows demand for and pricing of our products could be adversely affected 

our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by changes in product mix or pricing 

our results may be materially adversely affected by a change in our product mix or pricing some of our wood products such as lumber veneer plywood and oriented strand board are commodities and are subject to fluctuations in market pricing if pricing on our commodity products decreases and if we are not successful in increasing sales of higherpriced highervalue products or if we are not successful in implementing price increases or there are delays in acceptance of price increases or higherpriced products our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected price discounting if required to maintain our competitive position in one or more markets could result in lower than anticipated price realizations and margins 

we face intense competition in our markets any failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we compete with north american producers and for some of our product lines global producers some of which may have greater financial resources and lower production costs than do we the principal basis for competition for many of our products is selling price our industries also are particularly sensitive to other factors including innovation design quality and service with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line to the extent that any of our competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor our ability to attract and retain customers and maintain and increase sales could be materially adversely affected any failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  weyerhaeuser company  2018 annual report and form 10k   27 

                      

another form of competition is between brands of sustainably produced products customer demand for certain brands could reduce competition among buyers for our products or cause other adverse effects 

we have adopted the sustainable forestry initiative sfi standard for wood fiber supplied to our manufacturing facilities both from our timberlands and from thirdparty suppliers some of our customers have expressed a preference in certain of our product lines for products made from raw materials sourced from forests certified to different standards including standards of the forest stewardship council fsc if customer preference for a sustainability standard other than sfi   increases or if the sfi   standard falls into disfavor   there may be reduced demand and lower prices for our products relative to competitors who can supply products sourced from forests certified to competing certification standards if we seek to comply with such other standards we could incur materially increased costs for our operations or be required to modify our operations such as reducing harvest levels fsc in particular employs standards that are geographically variable and could cause a material reduction in the harvest levels of some of our timberlands most notably in the pacific northwest 

our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials and energy 

we rely heavily on certain raw materials principally wood fiber and chemicals and energy sources principally natural gas electricity and fuel oil in our manufacturing processes our ability to increase earnings has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials and energy sources we may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material or energy costs through price increases productivity improvements costreduction programs or hedging arrangements 



capital markets 

deterioration in economic conditions and capital markets could adversely affect our access to capital 

challenging market conditions could impair the company ’ s ability to raise debt or equity capital or otherwise access capital markets on terms acceptable to us which may among other effects reduce our ability to take advantage of growth and expansion opportunities likewise our customers and suppliers may be unable to raise capital to fund their operations which could in turn adversely affect their ability to purchase products or sell products to us 

credit ratings 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results and balance sheet actions that we take their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy ratings decisions by these agencies include maintaining upgrading or downgrading our current rating as well as placing the company on a watch list for possible future ratings actions any downgrade of our credit rating or decision by a rating agency to place us on a watch list for possible future downgrading could have an adverse effect on our ability to access credit markets increase our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

capital requirements and access to capital 

access to capital required for our operations may be costly or impaired 

our businesses require substantial capital for expansion and for repair or replacement of existing facilities or equipment although we maintain our production equipment with regular scheduled maintenance key pieces of equipment may need to be repaired or replaced periodically the costs of repairing or replacing such equipment and the associated downtime of the affected production line could have a significant effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

while we believe our capital resources will be adequate to meet our current projected operating needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements if for any reason we are unable to access capital for our operating needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements on acceptable economic terms or at all we could experience a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

foreign currency 

we will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates 

we have manufacturing operations in canada we are also an exporter and compete with global producers of products very similar to ours therefore we are affected by changes in the strength of the us dollar particularly relative to the canadian dollar euro yuan and yen and the strength of the euro relative to the yen changes in exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our sales volume margins and results of operations 

  weyerhaeuser company  2018 annual report and form 10k   28 

                      



environmental laws and regulations 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with violations of or liabilities under applicable environmental laws and other laws and regulations 

we are subject to a wide range of general and industryspecific laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing 

 we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations and as a result of remedial obligations we also could incur substantial costs such as civil or criminal fines sanctions and enforcement actions including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions cleanup and closure costs and thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations 

as the owner and operator of real estate we may be liable under environmental laws for cleanup closure and other damages resulting from the presence and release of hazardous substances on or from our properties or operations in addition surface water management regulations may present liabilities and are subject to change the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict and in some cases our liability may exceed forecasted amounts or the value of the property itself the discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at our sites or thirdparty sites may result in significant additional costs 

we also lease some of our properties to thirdparty operators for the purpose of exploring extracting developing and producing oil gas rock and other minerals in exchange for fees and royalty payments these activities are also subject to federal state and local laws and regulations these operations may create risk of environmental liabilities for any unlawful discharge of oil gas or other chemicals into the air soil or water generally these thirdparty operators indemnify us against any such liability and we require that that they maintain liability insurance during the term of our lease with them however if for any reason our thirdparty operators are not able to honor their indemnity obligation or if the required liability insurance were not in effect then it is possible that we could be deemed responsible for costs associated with   environmental liability caused by such thirdparty operators 

any material liability we incur as a result of activities conducted on our properties by us or by others with whom we have a business relationship could adversely affect our financial condition 

we also anticipate public policy developments at the state federal and international level regarding climate change and energy access security and competitiveness we expect these developments to address emission of carbon dioxide renewable energy and fuel standards and the monetization of carbon compliance with regulations that implement new public policy in these areas might require significant expenditures these developments may also include mandated changes to energy use and building codes which could affect our homebuilding practices enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretation of these laws or regulations might require significant expenditures we also anticipate public policy developments at the state federal and international level regarding taxes and a number of other areas that could require significant expenditures 

changes in global or regional climate conditions and governmental response to such changes at the international us federal and state levels may affect our operations or our planned or future growth activities 

there continue to be numerous international us federal and statelevel initiatives and proposals to address domestic and global climate issues within the us and canada some of these proposals would and have in some canadian provinces regulate andor tax the production of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to facilitate the reduction of carbon compound emissions into the atmosphere and provide tax and other incentives to produce and use cleaner energy climate change effects if they occur and governmental initiatives laws and regulations to address potential climate concerns could increase our costs and have a longterm adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations future legislation or regulatory activity in this area remains uncertain and its effect on our operations is unclear at this time however it is possible that legislation or government mandates standards or regulations intended to mitigate or reduce carbon compound or greenhouse gas emissions or other climate change effects could adversely affect our operations for example such activities could limit harvest levels or result in significantly higher costs for energy and other raw materials because our manufacturing operations depend upon significant amounts of energy and raw materials these initiatives could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability 

legal matters 

we are involved in various environmental regulatory product liability and other legal matters disputes and proceedings that if determined or concluded in a manner adverse to our interests could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

we are from time to time involved in a number of legal matters disputes and proceedings legal matters some of which involve ongoing litigation these include without limitation legal matters involving environmental cleanup and remediation warranty and nonwarranty product liability claims regulatory issues contractual and personal injury claims and other legal matters in some cases all or a portion of any loss we experience in connection with any such legal matters will be covered by insurance in other cases any such losses will not be covered 

  weyerhaeuser company  2018 annual report and form 10k   29 

                      

the outcome costs and other effects of current legal matters in which we are involved and any related insurance recoveries cannot be determined with certainty although the disclosures in note 15 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies  and note 20 income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  contain management ’ s current views of the effect such legal matters could have on our financial results there can be no assurance that the outcome of such legal matters will be as currently expected it is possible that there could be adverse judgments against us in some or all major litigation matters against us and that we could be required to take a charge and make cash payments for all or a portion of any related awards of damages any one or more of such charges or cash payment could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows for the quarter or year in which we record or pay it 

reit status and tax implications 

if we fail to remain qualified as a reit our taxable income would be subject to tax at corporate rates and we would not be able to deduct dividends to shareholders 

in any taxable year in which we fail to qualify as a reit unless we are entitled to relief under the internal revenue code 

 qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code to our operations and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions although we operate in a manner consistent with the reit qualification rules we cannot assure you that we are or will remain so qualified 

certain of our business activities are subject to corporatelevel income tax and potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax 

under the internal revenue code reits generally must engage in the ownership and management of income producing real estate for the 

company this generally includes owning and managing a timberland portfolio for the production and sale of standing timber accordingly the harvesting and sale of logs the development or sale of certain timberlands and other real estate and the manufacture and sale of wood products are conducted through one or more of our whollyowned taxable reit subsidiaries trss the net income of which is subject to corporatelevel tax because such activities could generate nonqualifying reit income and thus could constitute “prohibited transactions” prohibited transactions are defined by the internal revenue code generally to be sales or other dispositions of property to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business by conducting our business in this manner we believe that we satisfy the reit requirements of the internal revenue code however if the irs were to successfully assert that these or any of our activities conducted at the reit constituted prohibited transactions we could be subject to the 100 percent tax on the net income from such activities 

the extent of our use of our trss may affect the price of our common shares relative to the share price of other reits 

we conduct a significant portion of our business activities through one or more trss the use of our trss enables us to engage in nonreit qualifying business activities such as the sale of logs production and sale of wood products and the development and sale of certain higher and better use hbu property our trss are subject to corporatelevel income tax under the code no more than 20 percent of the value of the gross assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss this limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our trss’ operations furthermore our use of trss may cause the market to value our common shares differently than the shares of other reits which may not use trss as extensively as we use them 

we may be limited in our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our trss 

the ability of the reit to receive dividends from our trss is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a reit in particular at least 75 percent of gross income for each taxable year as a reit must be derived from real estate sources including sales of our standing timber and other types of qualifying real estate income and no more than 25 percent of our gross income may consist of dividends from our trss and other nonreal estate income 

this limitation on our ability to receive dividends from our trss may affect our ability to fund cash distributions to our shareholders using cash flows from our trss the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed and trs income that is not distributed to the reit will not be subject to the reit income distribution requirement 

our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate  

generally reits are required to distribute 90 percent of their ordinary taxable income and 95 percent of their net capital gains income capital gains may be retained by the reit but would be subject to corporate income taxes if capital gains are retained rather than distributed our shareholders would be notified and they would be deemed to have received a taxable distribution with a refundable credit for any federal income tax paid by the reit accordingly we believe that we are not required to distribute material amounts of cash since substantially all of our taxable income is treated as capital gains income our board of directors in its sole discretion determines the amount of quarterly dividends to be provided to our shareholders based on consideration of a number of factors these factors include but are not limited to our results of operations cash flow and capital requirements economic conditions tax considerations borrowing capacity and other factors including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments future acquisitions and divestitures harvest levels changes in the price and demand for our products and general market demand for timberlands including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses consequently our dividend levels may fluctuate 

changes in tax laws or their interpretation could adversely affect our shareholders and our results of operations 

federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process the internal revenue service the united states department of the treasury and state taxing authorities changes to tax laws could adversely affect our shareholders or increase our effective tax rates we cannot predict with certainty whether when in what forms or with what effective dates the tax laws applicable to us or our shareholders may be changed 

  weyerhaeuser company  2018 annual report and form 10k   30 

                      

importexport taxes and duties 

we may be required to pay significant taxes or tariffs on our exported products or countervailing and antidumping duties or tariffs on our imported products 

we export logs and finished wood products to foreign markets and our ability to do so profitably is affected by us and foreign trade policy international trade disputes occur frequently and can be taken to an international trade court for resolution of unfair trade practices between countries 

us international trade policy could result in one or more of our foreign export market jurisdictions adopting responsive trade policy making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries we could therefore experience reduced revenues and margins in any of our businesses that is adversely affected by international trade tariffs duties taxes customs or dispute settlement terms to the extent such trade policies increase prices they could also reduce the demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial results and financial condition including facility closures or impairments of assets we cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any settlements of international trade disputes and their effect on our business 

our merger with plum creek timber company inc 

we could incur substantial us federal tax liability in connection with our merger with plum creek 

on february 19 2016 plum creek timber company inc merged with and into weyerhaeuser company with weyerhaeuser continuing as the surviving company both companies have operated in a manner intended to qualify them as “reits” for us federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code see “reit status and tax implications” above for a description of the consequences of our failure to maintain reit status however even if we have operated in a manner that allows us to retain our reit status if plum creek were deemed to have lost its reit status for a taxable year before the merger or the taxable year in which the merger occurred we could face serious tax consequences that could substantially reduce cash available for distribution to our shareholders and significantly impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital in addition if the merger were determined not to qualify as a taxfree merger we could incur substantial federal tax liability that could materially and adversely affect the companys cash flows financial condition and results of operations 



cybersecurity 

we rely on information technology to support our operations and reporting environments a security failure of that technology could affect our ability to operate our businesses effectively adversely affect our reported financial results affect our reputation and expose us to potential liability or litigation 

we use information systems to carry out our operational activities maintain our business records collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property other proprietary and personally identifiable information some systems are internally managed and some are maintained by thirdparty service providers we and our service providers employ what we believe are reasonably adequate security measures but notwithstanding these efforts our systems could be compromised as a result of a cyber incident natural disaster hardware or software corruption failure or error telecommunications system failure service provider error or failure intentional or unintentional personnel actions or other disruption if by any cause our systems or information resources were compromised or if our data were destroyed misappropriated or inappropriately disclosed our business operations could be negatively affected additionally we could suffer significant loss or incur significant liability including damage to our reputation loss of customer confidence or goodwill and significant expenditures of time and money to address and remediate resulting damages to affected individuals or business partners or to defend ourselves in resulting litigation or other legal proceedings by affected individuals business partners or regulators 

pension plan liability 

investment returns on our pension assets may be lower than expected or interest rates may decline requiring us to make significant additional cash contributions to our benefit plans 

a portion of our current and former employees have accrued benefits under our defined benefit pension plans although the plans are not open to employees hired on or after january 1 2014 current employees hired before that time continue to accrue benefits requirements for funding our pension plan liabilities are based on a number of actuarial assumptions including the expected rate of return on our plan assets and the discount rate applied to our pension plan obligations fluctuations in equity market returns and changes in longterm interest rates could increase our costs under our plans and may significantly affect future contribution requirements it is unknown what the actual investment return on our pension assets will be in future years and what interest rates may be at any given point in time we cannot therefore provide any assurance of what our actual pension plan costs will be in the future or whether we will be required under applicable law to make future material plan contributions see note 10 pension and other postretirement benefit plans  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about these plans including funding status 

strategic initiatives 

our business and financial results may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully execute on important strategic initiatives   

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations which may result in an adverse effect on our business and financial results these strategic initiatives are designed to improve our results of operations and drive longterm shareholder value and include among others optimizing cash flow through operational excellence reducing costs to achieve industryleading cost structure and innovating in highermargin products  

we may be unsuccessful in carrying out our acquisition strategy 

we intend to strategically pursue acquisitions of timberland properties when market conditions warrant as with any investment our acquisitions may not perform in accordance with our expectations in addition we anticipate financing such acquisitions through cash from operations

borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities proceeds from equity or debt offerings or proceeds from asset dispositions or any combination thereof our inability to finance future acquisitions on favorable terms could adversely affect our results of operations 

workforce 

our business is dependent upon attracting retaining and developing key personnel 

our success depends to a significant extent upon our ability to attract retain and develop senior management operations management and other key personnel our financial condition or results of operations could be significantly adversely affected if we were to fail to recruit retain and develop such personnel or if there were to occur any significant increase in the cost of providing such personnel with competitive total compensation and benefits 

availability of independent contractors 

we use independent thirdparty contract loggers and haulers to deliver our logs to our customers as a result of the weak business conditions in the timber business that persisted for several years there are fewer of these contractors available in certain markets to harvest and deliver logs this shortage in logging and hauling contractors has resulted in an overall increase in logging and hauling costs and in some cases the general availability of these contractors any increase in harvest levels due to positive changes in macroeconomic conditions driving demand for logs could further strain the existing supply of logging and hauling contractors this in turn could increase the cost of log supply and delivery or prevent us from fully capitalizing on favorable market conditions by limiting our ability to access and deliver our logs to market 

stock price volatility 

the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors some of which are beyond our control 

the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors some of which are beyond our control including without limitation those described above and elsewhere in this report as well as the following 

 in addition there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in the forest products industry that often has been unrelated to individual company operating performance 

some companies that have experienced volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them if litigation of this type is brought against us it could result in substantial costs and divert management ’ s attention and resources

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda 



  

our mda includes the following major sections 

 



the demand for grade logs within our timberlands segment is directly affected by production levels of domestic woodbased building products the strength of the us housing market strongly affects demand in our wood products segment as does repair and remodeling activity our timberlands segment specifically the western region is also affected by export demand and trade policy japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in japan the demand for pulpwood from our timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp paper and osb as well as the demand for biofuels such as pellets made from pulpwood 

due to the partial government shutdown that occurred through late january 2019 fullyear 2018 housing data is unavailable however for the january 2018 through november 2018 period housing starts were 118 million total units which is 5 percent above the total of 112 units for the same period in 2017 according to the us census bureau single family units totaled 825 thousand compared to 794 thousand in 2017 a 4 percent increase multifamily starts were 354 thousand units for the first 11 months of 2018 which is 8 percent higher than 2017 for the same period we continue to expect improving us housing starts and anticipate a level of approximately 130 million units in 2019 which would be a 3 percent gain over 2018 assuming the year to date gains continue into december we attribute this continued improvement primarily to ongoing employment growth strong consumer confidence and mortgage rates which have stabilized and declined since peaking in late 2018 and remain affordable on a historic basis 

according to the joint center for housing of harvard university the leading indicator of remodeling activity lira projects that the yearoveryear increase in residential remodeling expenditures reached 72 percent in 2018 and is expected to average 65 percent in 2019 with expenditure growth tapering through the year and reaching the long term average level of 52 percent in the fourth quarter 2019 

in us wood product markets prices in 2018 were mixed rising the first half of the year to post record levels in may and june only to fall sharply in third and fourth quarter 2018 as supply issues related to transportation eased and producers increased output in response to high prices according to random lengths the framing lumber composite averaged 459mbf in 2018 an 11 percent increase over 2017 according to forest economic advisors llc us lumber consumption is expected to grow at a 35 percent rate in 2019 however due to declines forecast in offshore export volumes and increases in offshore imports the increase in overall demand on north american mills is expected to rise by 25 percent over 2018 log markets in the west were consistent with wood products manufacturing exhibiting strong demand and pricing in the first half followed by slower demand and weaker market prices for western logs in the second half of 2018 in the south log supplies kept pace with demand leaving prices flat throughout 2018 

log inventories in chinese ports decreased 09 percent in december 2018 compared to november 2018 as reported by international wood markets china bulletin while the decline in overall volume was slight there was a greater decline in north american hemlock and douglas fir volumes these species were 59 percent lower in december 2018 compared to november 2018 which has positive implications for demand at the start of 2019 as suppliers will need to rebuild depleted inventories total north american volumes increased in 2018 by 3 percent over 2017 despite retaliatory tariffs imposed by the chinese government against us imports in addition exchange rates also have an effect on our export business to china a weaker yuan relative to the us dollar reduces the competitiveness of us logs relative to those imported from other countries whose currencies have not appreciated in a similar manner during 2018 the yuan weakened relative to the us dollar which affects the competitiveness of our export logs to china 

in japan housing starts for november year to date for 2018 were down 27 percent from the same period in 2017 while the key post and beam segment was 08 percent lower in the first 11 months of 2018 compared to 2017 

we expect demand from china and japan in 2019 to be similar to demand experienced in 2018 

our real estate  enr segment is affected by the health of the us economy and especially the us housing sector of the economy according to the realtors land institute rli of the national association of realtors the dollar volume of rural properties sold including timber grew 2 percent in 2018 and per acre prices were also up 2 percent on average additionally rli expects these trends to continue with prices and volumes of land transactions forecast to rise 3 percent in 2019

we operate a total of 19 softwood lumber mills with a total capacity of approximately 5 billion  board feet three of these mills located in canada produce approximately 900 million board feet annually and sell products in canada asia and the us 

in april 2017 the us department of commerce announced a preliminary determination that it would implement countervailing duties cvd on canadian softwood lumber shipments to the us at the rate of 1988 percent with a 90 day retroactive period the preliminary countervailing duties were suspended in august 2017 at which time we effectively stopped accruing for the expense the suspension of the countervailing duties was set to last until the us international trade commission reached its final determination of injury which was issued in december 2017 

in june 2017 the us department of commerce announced a preliminary determination that it would implement antidumping duties ad on canadian softwood lumber shipments to the us at the rate of 687 percent with a 90 day retroactive period 

affirmative final determinations by the department of commerce doc and the us international trade commission usitc in december 2017 issued cvd and ad duty orders on certain softwood lumber products from canada based on these determinations the cvd rate applicable to weyerhaeuser is 1419 percent and is assessed on entries of softwood lumber from canada for consumption on or after april 28 2017 the ad rate applicable to weyerhaeuser is 604 percent and is assessed on entries of softwood lumber from canada for consumption on or after june 30 2017 

for the years ended december 31 2018 and december 31 2017 we have expensed cvd and ad duties at the final published rates totaling 21 million  and 7 million  respectively these costs are recorded in costs of sales within the wood products segment

see note 15 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies   in the notes to consolidated financial statements  



critical accounting policies 

in the preparation of our financial statements we follow established accounting policies and make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets liabilities revenues and expenses some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position are considered critical accounting policies 

in accounting we base our judgments and estimates on 

 actual results however may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded 

our most critical accounting policies relate to our 



  weyerhaeuser company  2018 annual report and form 10k   50 

                      

details about our other significant accounting policies — what we use and how we estimate — are in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

pension and postretirement benefit plans   

we sponsor several pension and postretirement benefit plans for our employees key estimates we use in accounting for the plans include our 

 at the end of every year we review our key estimates with external advisers and make adjustments as appropriate we use these estimates to calculate plan asset and liability information as of yearend as well as pension and postretirement expense for the following year actual experience that differs from our estimates or any changes in our estimates could have a significant effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

fair value of plan assets 

plan assets are assets of the pension plan trusts that fund the benefits provided under the pension plans the fair value of our plan assets estimates the amount that would be received if we were to sell each asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date we estimate the fair value of these assets based on the information available during the yearend reporting process in some cases primarily private equity and hedge funds the available information consists of net asset values as of an interim date adjusted for known events occurring between the interim date and yearend 

we value the pension plan assets based on the observability of exit pricing inputs and classify pension plan assets based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the pension plan assets in their entirety these inputs are classified within the fair value hierarchy as follows 

 assets that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share as a practical expedient are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy 

in general we value our pension plan assets as follows 

 

assets that do not have readily available quoted prices in an active market require more judgment to value and have increased risk 

expected longterm rate of return on plan assets 

the expected longterm rate of return is our estimate of the longterm rate of return that our plan assets will earn our expected longterm rate of return is important in determining the net periodic benefit or cost we recognize for our plans 

after considering available information at the end of 2016 we determined that it was appropriate to reduce our assumption of longterm rate of return on plan assets from 90 percent for the year ended december 31 2016 to 80 percent for the year ended december 31 2017 this decision was based on a variety of factors including the net compounded annual return achieved by our investment strategy and expected valuation levels in the global equity and credit markets we continued to use an assumption of 80 percent for the year ended december 31 2018 

as of the end of 2018 we have begun implementing a change in our asset strategy to an allocation that will more closely match the plan’s liability profile moving forward resulting in a larger allocation of our assets into fixed income securities with this change we have determined that we will further reduce our assumption of longterm rate of return on plan assets to 70 percent  for the year ended december 31 2019 

factors we considered include 

 our expected longterm rate of return is important in determining the net periodic benefit or cost we recognize for our plans every 50 basis point decrease in our expected longterm rate of return would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately 

 the actual return on plan assets in any given year may vary from our expected longterm rate of return actual returns on plan assets affect the funded status of the plans differences between actual returns on plan assets and the expected longterm rate of return are reflected as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive loss a component of total equity 

discount rates 

the discount rate is used to estimate the net present value of our plan obligations our discount rates as of december 31 2018  are 



  weyerhaeuser company  2018 annual report and form 10k   51 

                      

the discount rates are selected at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of highquality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits 

pension and postretirement benefit expenses for 2019  will be based on the 44 percent  and 42 percent  assumed discount rates for us plans respectively and 37 percent  assumed discount rates for the canadian plans 

our discount rates are important in determining the cost of our plans a 50 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately 

 

longlived assets 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets whenever an event or a change in circumstance a triggering event indicates that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable through future operations the carrying value is the original cost less accumulated depreciation and any past impairments recorded there were no significant triggering events during 2018 

if we evaluate recoverability we are required to estimate future cash flows and residual values of the asset or asset groups key assumptions used in developing these estimates would include probability of alternative outcomes product pricing raw material costs and product sales 

an impairment occurs when the carrying value of a longlived asset is greater than the amount that could be recovered from the estimated future cash flows of the asset and greater than fair market value the amount we could receive if we were to sell the asset   key assumptions used in developing estimates of fair value would include the estimated future cash flows used to assess recoverability discount rates and probability of alternative outcomes 

contingent liabilities 

we are subject to lawsuits investigations and other claims related to environmental product and other matters and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 

we record contingent liabilities when 

 assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors including 

 in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that an ultimate loss may occur 

while we do our best in developing our projections recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain if estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges these exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flow in any given quarter or year see note 15 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for more information 

prospective accounting pronouncements

our timberlands segment manages 124 million  acres of private commercial timberlands in the us we own 115 million  of those acres and have longterm leases on the remaining acres in addition we have renewable longterm licenses on 140 million  acres of canadian timberlands the tables presented in this section include data from this segments business units as of the end of 2017  

what we do 

forestry management 

our timberlands segment 

 our goal is to maximize returns by selling logs and stumpage to internal and external customers we leverage our expertise in forestry and use intensive silviculture to improve forest productivity and returns while managing our forests on a sustainable basis to meet customer needs and public expectations 

competitive factors within each of our market areas generally include price species grade quality proximity to wood consuming facilities and the ability to consistently meet customer requirements we compete in the marketplace through our ability to provide customers with a consistent and reliable supply of highquality logs at scale volumes and competitive price our customers also value our status as a sustainable forestry initiative® certified supplier 

sustainable forestry practices 

we manage our forests intensively to maximize the value of each acre and produce a sustainable supply of wood fiber for our customers at the same time we are careful to protect biological diversity water quality and other ecosystem services our working forests also provide unique environmental cultural historical and recreational value we work hard to protect these and other qualities while still managing our forests to produce financially mature timber we follow regulatory requirements voluntary standards and certify one hundred percent of our north american timberlands under the sustainable forestry initiative® sfi forest management standard 

canadian forestry operations 

in canada we manage timberlands under longterm licenses that provide the primary source of the raw material for our manufacturing facilities in various provinces when we harvest trees we pay the provinces at stumpage rates set by the government we transfer logs to our manufacturing facilities at cost and do not generate any significant profit in the timberlands segment from the harvest of timber from the licensed acres in canada 

timberlands products 



how we measure our product 

we use multiple units of measure when transacting business including 

 we report timberland volumes in ton equivalents prior to 2016 we reported timberlands volumes information in cubic meters volumes for periods prior to 2016 have been converted from cubic meters to tons using conversion factors as follows 

 where we do it 

we manage sustainable timberlands in twenty states this includes owned or leased acres in the following locations

in canada we manage timberlands under longterm licenses that provide raw material for our manufacturing facilities these licenses are in alberta british columbia ontario license is managed by partnership and saskatchewan license is managed by partnership 

our total timber inventory — including timber on owned and leased land— is approximately 635 million  tons the amount of timber inventory does not translate into an amount of lumber or panel products because the quantity of end products varies according to the species size and quality of the timber and will change through time as these variables adjust 

we maintain our timber inventory in an integrated resource inventory system and geographic information system “gis” the resource inventory component of the system is proprietary and is largely based on internally developed methods including growth and yield models developed by our research and development organization the gis component is based on gis software that is viewed as the standard in our industry 

timber inventory data collection and verification techniques include the use of industry standard field sampling procedures as well as proprietary remote sensing technologies in some geographies the data is collected and maintained at the timber stand level 

we also own and operate nurseries and seed orchards in alabama arkansas georgia louisiana mississippi oregon south carolina and washington

real estate energy and natural resources 

our real estate  enr segment maximizes the value of our timberland ownership through application of our asset value optimization avo process and captures the full value of surface and subsurface assets such as oil natural gas minerals and wind resources 

what we do 

real estate 

properties that exhibit higher value than commercial timberlands are monetized within our real estate business we analyze existing us timberland holdings using a process we call avo we start with understanding the value of a parcel operating as commercial timberlands and then assess the specific real estate attributes of the parcel and its corresponding market the assessment includes demographics infrastructure and proximity to amenities and recreation to determine the potential to yield a premium value to commercial timberland attributes can evolve over time and accordingly the assignment of value and opportunity can change 

these properties are acres we expect to sell andor entitle to support development for recreational conservation commercial or residential purposes over time development outside of entitlement activities is typically performed by third parties some of our real estate activities are conducted through our taxable reit subsidiary 

occasionally we sell a small amount of timberlands acreage in areas where we choose to reduce our market presence or we can capture a price that exceeds the value derivable from holding and operating as commercial timberlands these transactions will vary based on factors including the locations and physical characteristics of the timberlands 

the timing of real estate sales is a function of many factors including the general state of the economy demand in local real estate markets the ability of buyers to obtain financing the number of competing properties listed for sale the seasonal nature of sales particularly in the northern states the plans of adjacent landowners our expectation of future price appreciation the timing of the harvesting activities and the availability of government and notforprofit funding in any period the average sales price per acre will vary based on the location and physical characteristics of parcels sold 

the avo review of our legacy weyerhaeuser southern timberlands was completed in fourth quarter 2016 the avo review of our legacy weyerhaeuser western timberlands was completed in second quarter 2017 we will continually revisit our avo assessment of all of our us timberland acres including legacy plum creek acres for which avo assessment was completed prior to the merger

we are subject to a multitude of laws and regulations in the operation of our businesses we also participate in voluntary certification of our timberlands to ensure that we sustain their overall quality including the protection of wildlife and water quality changes in law and regulation or certification standards can significantly affect our business 

regulations affecting forestry practices 

in the united states regulations established by federal state and local government agencies to protect water quality wetlands and other wildlife habitat could affect future harvests and forest management practices on our timberlands forest practice laws and regulations that affect present or future harvest and forest management activities in certain states include 

 each state in which we own timberlands has developed best management practices to reduce the effects of forest practices on water quality and aquatic habitats additional and more stringent regulations may be adopted by various state and local governments to achieve waterquality standards under the federal clean water act protect fish and wildlife habitats human health or achieve other public policy objectives 

in canada our forest operations are carried out on public timberlands under forest licenses with the provinces all forest operations are subject to 

    protect environmental values and 

    encourage other stewardship values 

in canada 21 member companies of the forest products association of canada fpac including weyerhaeuser ’ s canadian subsidiary announced in may 2010 the signing of a canadian boreal forest agreement cbfa with nine environmental organizations the cbfa applies to approximately 72 million hectares of public forests licensed to fpac members and when fully implemented was expected to lead to the conservation of significant areas of canada ’ s boreal forest and protection of boreal species at risk in particular woodland caribou while the cbfa mandate came to an end in 2017 cbfa signatories continue to work on management plans with provincial governments and seek the participation of aboriginal and local communities in advancing the goals of the cbfa 

endangered species protections 

in the united states a number of fish and wildlife species that inhabit geographic areas near or within our timberlands have been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal endangered species act esa or similar state laws such as 

 additional species or populations may be listed as threatened or endangered as a result of pending or future citizen petitions or petitions initiated by federal or state agencies in addition significant citizen litigation seeks to compel the federal agencies to designate critical habitat for esalisted species and many cases have resulted in settlements under which designations will be implemented over time such designations may adversely affect some management activities and options restrictions on timber harvests can result from 

 

such actions could increase our operating costs and affect timber supply and prices in general to date we do not believe that these measures have had and we do not believe that in 2018  they will have a significant effect on our harvesting operations we anticipate that likely future actions will not disproportionately affect weyerhaeuser as compared with comparable operations of us competitors 

in canada 

 

  weyerhaeuser company  2017 annual report and form 10k   19 

  

the identification and protection of habitat and the implementation of range plans and land use action plans may over time result in additional restrictions on timber harvests and other forest management practices that could increase operating costs for operators of timberlands in canada to date we do not believe that these canadian measures have had and we do not believe that in 2018  they will have a significant effect on our harvesting operations we anticipate that likely future measures will not disproportionately affect weyerhaeuser as compared with similar operations of canadian competitors 

forest certification standards 

we operate in north america under the sustainable forestry initiative sfi ®  this is a certification standard designed to supplement government regulatory programs with voluntary landowner initiatives to further protect certain public resources and values sfi ®  is an independent standard overseen by a governing board consisting of 

 ongoing compliance with sfi ®  may result in some increases in our operating costs and curtailment of our timber harvests in some areas there also is competition from other private certification systems primarily the forest stewardship council fsc coupled with efforts by supporters to further those systems by persuading customers of forest products to require products certified to their preferred system certain features of the fsc system could impose additional operating costs on timberland management because of the considerable variation in fsc standards and variability in how those standards are interpreted and applied if sufficient marketplace demand develops for products made from raw materials sourced from other than sficertified forests we could incur substantial additional costs for operations and be required to reduce harvest levels 

what these regulations and certification programs mean to us 

the regulatory and nonregulatory forest management programs described above have 

 we believe that these kinds of programs have not had and in 2018  will not have a significant effect on our total harvest of timber in the united states or canada however these kinds of programs may have such an effect in the future we expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these programs as compared with typical owners of comparable timberlands we also expect that these programs will not significantly disrupt our planned operations over large areas or for extended periods 

canadian aboriginal rights 

many of the canadian timberlands are subject to the constitutionally protected treaty or commonlaw rights of aboriginal peoples of canada most of british columbia bc is not covered by treaties and as a result the claims of bc’s aboriginal peoples relating to forest resources have been largely unresolved on june 26 2014 the supreme court of canada ruled that the tsilhqot’in nation holds aboriginal title to approximately 1900 square kilometers in bc this was the first time that the court has declared title to exist based on historical occupation by aboriginal peoples many aboriginal groups continue to be engaged in treaty discussions with the governments of bc other provinces and canada 

final or interim resolution of claims brought by aboriginal groups can be expected to result in 

 we believe that such claims will not have a significant effect on our total harvest of timber or production of forest products in 2018  although they may have such an effect in the future in 2008 fpac of which we are a member signed a memorandum of understanding with the assembly of first nations under which the parties agree to work together to strengthen canada ’ s forest sector through economicdevelopment initiatives and business investments strong environmental stewardship and the creation of skilldevelopment opportunities particularly targeted to aboriginal youth 

pollutioncontrol regulations 

our operations are subject to various laws and regulations including 

 these laws and regulations as well as market demands impose controls with regard to 



  weyerhaeuser company  2017 annual report and form 10k   20 

  

compliance with these laws regulations and demands usually involves capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs we cannot easily quantify the future amounts of capital expenditures we might have to make to comply with these laws regulations and demands or the effects on our operating costs because in some instances compliance standards have not been developed or have not become final or definitive in addition it is difficult to isolate the environmental component of most manufacturing capital projects 

our capital projects typically are designed to 

 

environmental cleanup 

we are involved in the environmental investigation or remediation of numerous sites of these sites 

 our liability with respect to these various sites ranges from insignificant to substantial the amount of liability depends on 

 we spent approximately 15 million  in 2017  and expect to spend approximately 14 million  in 2018  on environmental remediation of these sites 

it is our policy to accrue for environmentalremediation costs when we 

 we currently believe it is reasonably possible that our costs to remediate all the identified sites may exceed our current accruals of 48 million  based on currently available information and analysis remediation costs for all identified sites may exceed our existing reserves by up to 150 million  this estimate of the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs is much less certain than the estimates we currently are using to determine how much to accrue the estimate of the upper range also uses assumptions less favorable to us among the range of reasonably possible outcomes 

regulation of air emissions in the us 

the united states environmental protection agency epa has promulgated regulations for air emissions from 

 these regulations cover 

 between 2011 and 2015 the epa issued three related portions of new mact standards for industrial boilers and process heaters in july 2016 a court decision was issued that remains unsettled at this time but which will cause certain of the emissions standards to be reissued some of these reissued emissions standards will be applicable to a small number of our wood products mills because the court decision remains unsettled and because we do not know how or when the epa will implement the final court decision we cannot predict whether or when the emission standard revisions may have a material impact on regulatory compliance costs at our mills we do not expect any material expenditures in 2017 to comply with mact standards 

the epa must still promulgate supplemental mact standards for plywood lumber and composite wood products facilities the epa is expected to collect information for these future rulemakings in 2017 

we cannot currently quantify the amount of capital we will need in the future to comply with new regulations being developed by the epa because final rules have not been promulgated 

in 2010 the epa issued a final greenhouse gas rule limiting the growth of emissions from new projects meeting certain thresholds on june 23 2014 the us supreme court issued a decision that removed potential applicability of the underlying 2010 regulations based solely on greenhouse gas emissions and limited application of the rule’s technology requirements to larger emission sources as a result of new emissions from nongreenhouse gas pollutants as a result of this supreme court ruling epa is expected to issue new regulations to set thresholds for when the greenhouse gas technology requirements apply if the nongreenhouse gas emissions trigger the rule in the first instance the impact of the supreme court ruling is to end the potential applicability of the technology requirements for our smaller manufacturing operations and limit the applicability for our other operations 

in 2015 the epa issued an extensive regulatory program for new and existing electric utility generating units to scale back emissions of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide co2 arising from fossil fuel use to generate electricity epa also proposed additional regulations related to how states and federal agencies may implement the requirements finalized in 2015 this regulatory program potentially will have indirect impacts on our operations such as from rising purchased electricity prices or from mandated energy demand reductions that could apply to our mills and other facilities that we operate we are evaluating the regulations and additional proposals but are not able to predict whether the regulations when complete and implemented will have a material impact on our operations 

  weyerhaeuser company  2017 annual report and form 10k   21 

  

we use significant biomass for energy production at our mills epa is currently working on rules regarding regulation of biomass emissions 

the impact of these greenhouse gas and biomass rules as well as recent court decisions on our operations remains uncertain 

to address concerns about greenhouse gases as a pollutant we 

 additional factors that could affect greenhouse gas emissions in the future include 

 we believe these developments have not had and in 2018  will not have a significant effect on our operations although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations we maintain an active forestry research program to track and understand any potential effect from actual climate change related parameters that could affect the forests we own and manage and do not anticipate any disruptions to our planned operations 

regulation of air emissions in canada 

in addition to existing provincial air quality regulations the canadian federal government has proposed an air quality management system aqms as a comprehensive national approach for improving air quality in canada the federal proposed aqms includes 

 in 2016 environment canada released the pancanadian framework on clean growth and climate change a greenhouse gas emission framework the framework put in place a national sectorbased greenhouse gas reduction program applicable to a number of industries 

all canadian provincial governments 

 in addition british columbia has adopted a carbon tax and alberta has a mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction regulation 

we believe these measures have not had and in 2018  will not have a significant effect on our operations although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations we also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations 

regulation of water 

in the us as a result of litigation under the federal clean water act additional federal or state permits are now required in some states for the application of pesticides including herbicides on timberlands those permits have entailed payment of additional costs in 2015 federal regulatory agencies adopted rules that potentially expand the definition of waters subject to federal clean water act jurisdiction which could increase the scope and number of permits required for forestryrelated activities and entail additional costs for weyerhaeuser and other forest landowners in the us those rules were challenged in various federal courts by numerous parties and states and a nationwide injunction was issued against the rule by the sixth circuit court of appeals the us supreme court recently ruled that the circuit court does not have jurisdiction over the case so the nationwide injunction will be dissolved in the immediate future but one other injunction still blocks the rule in several states on january 31 2018 federal agencies took regulatory action to further delay the 2015 rules from going into effect until february 2020 that action will likely be challenged in litigation if any such challenge is successful other injunctive efforts will likely be pursued by the parties to one or more of the other pending cases challenging the 2015 rules whose jurisdiction has now been confirmed by the supreme court meanwhile the federal agencies will likely continue to pursue the repeal of the 2015 rules entirely and replacement of them with the pre2015 rules we are not able to predict the ultimate resolution of these pending legal and regulatory actions 

in 2016 washington state department of ecology wa doe adopted human healthbased water quality criteria the epa subsequently promulgated its own water quality standards for washington state for the protection of human health for certain pollutants it is unclear what effect if any these rules will have on our manufacturing operations in washington state 

in 2016 the epa finalized new and revised federal clean water act water quality standards and human health criteria that would apply to waters under the state of maines jurisdiction 

in addition in 2013 amendments to the canadian federal fisheries act came into force these amendments change the focus from habitat protection to fisheries protection and increase penalties we expect further changes to these regulations subsequent to review and regulatory consultations that took place in 2016 but we cannot predict the scope or potential impact if any on our operations 

we believe the above developments have not had and in 2018  will not have a significant effect on our operations although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations we also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations

potential changes in pollution regulation 

state governments continue to promulgate total maximum daily load tmdl requirements for pollutants in water bodies that do not meet state or epa water quality standards state tmdl requirements may 

 it is not possible to estimate the capital expenditures that may be required for us to meet pollution allocations across the various proposed state tmdl programs until a specific tmdl is promulgated 

in canada various levels of government have been working to address water issues including use quality and management recent areas of focus include water allocation regional watershed protection protection of drinking water water pricing and a national water quality index

risk factors 

we are subject to various risks and events that could adversely affect our business our financial condition our results of operations our cash flows and the price of our common stock 

you should consider the following risk factors in addition to the information presented elsewhere in this report particularly in  our business  who we are   our business  what we do   our business  natural resources and environmental matters  “ forwardlooking statements ” and  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as in the filings we make from time to time with the sec in evaluating us our business and an investment in our securities 

the risks discussed below are not the only risks we face additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely affect our business 



macroeconomic conditions 

the industries in which we operate are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions and consequently are highly cyclical 

the overall levels of demand for the products we manufacture and distribute reflect fluctuations in levels of enduser demand which consequently impact our sales and profitability enduser demand depends in large part on general macroeconomic conditions both in the us and globally as well as on local economic conditions current economic conditions in the united states reflect growth at or below historical trends global economic conditions reflect issues such as inflation and volatile and sporadic growth in emerging countries the length and magnitude of industry cycles vary over time both by market and by product but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions and levels of industry capacity any decline or stagnation in macroeconomic conditions could cause us to experience lower sales volume and reduced margins 

commodity products 

many of our products are commodities that are widely available from other producers 

because commodity products have few distinguishing properties from producer to producer competition for these products is based primarily on price which is determined by supply relative to demand and competition from substitute products in addition prices for our products are affected by many other factors outside of our control as a result we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes which often are volatile our profitability with respect to these products depends in part on managing our costs particularly raw material labor including contract labor and energy costs which represent significant components of our operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control both sales and profitability of our products are subject to volatility due to market forces beyond our control 

industry supply of logs and wood products 

excess supply of logs and wood products may adversely affect prices and margins 

our industry may increase harvest levels which could lead to an oversupply of logs wood products producers may likewise expand manufacturing capacity which could lead to an oversupply of manufactured wood products any increase of industry supply to our markets could adversely affect our prices and margins 

homebuilding market and economic risks 

high unemployment low demand and low levels of consumer confidence can adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our business is dependent upon the health of the us housing market demand for homes is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as the level of employment consumer confidence consumer income the availability of financing and interest rate levels other factors that could limit or adversely affect demand for new homes and hence demand for our products include factors such as limited wage growth increases in nonmortgage consumer debt any weakening in consumer confidence and any increase in foreclosure rates and distress sales of houses 

homebuyers’ ability to qualify for and obtain affordable mortgages could be affected by changes in interest rates changes in home loan underwriting standards and government sponsored entities and private mortgage insurance companies supporting the mortgage market 

access to affordable mortgage financing is critical to the health of the us housing market generally increases in interest rates make it more difficult for home buyers to obtain mortgage financing which could negatively affect demand for housing and in turn negatively affect demand for our wood products after an extended period during which the us federal reserve kept its benchmark interest rate at historically low levels it began raising rates again in 2016 and 2017 the number and extent of further rate increases is uncertain 

credit requirements were severely tightened and the number of mortgage loans available for financing home purchases were severely reduced during the most recent recession and ensuing credit crisis although the availability of credit has improved since that time the demand for new homes could be limited or adversely affected if credit requirements were to again tighten or become more restrictive for any reason 

the liquidity provided to the mortgage industry by fannie mae and freddie mac both of which purchase home mortgages and mortgagebacked securities originated by mortgage lenders has been critical to the housing market any political or other developments that would have the effect of limiting or restricting the availability of financing by these government sponsored entities could also adversely affect interest rates and the availability of mortgage financing whether resulting from direct increases in borrowing rates tightened underwriting standards on mortgage loans or reduced federal support of the mortgage lending industry a challenging mortgage financing environment could reduce demand for housing and therefore adversely affect demand for our products 

  weyerhaeuser company  2017 annual report and form 10k   25 

  

changes in regulations relating to tax deductions for mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes could harm our future sales and earnings 

significant costs of homeownership include mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes both of which are generally deductible for an individual ’ s federal and in some cases state income taxes recent federal legislation reduced the amount of mortgage interest and real estate taxes that certain taxpayers may deduct these and any similar changes to income tax laws by the federal government or by a state government to eliminate or substantially reduce these income tax deductions or any increase in real property taxes by local governments may increase the cost of homeownership and thus could adversely affect the demand for our products 

transportation 

we depend on third parties for transportation services and increases in costs and disruptions in the availability of transportation could materially adversely affect our business and operations 

our business depends heavily on the availability of thirdparty transportation service providers for the transportation of our manufactured wood products and wood fiber we are therefore materially affected by the availability and cost of these services any significant increase in the operating costs to our service providers including without limitation the cost of fuel or labor could have a material negative impact on our financial results by increasing the cost of these services to us as well as result in an overall reduction in the availability of these services altogether 

our thirdparty transportation providers are also subject to several events outside of their control such as disruption of transportation infrastructure labor issues and natural disasters any failure of a thirdparty transportation provider to timely deliver our products including delivery of our wood products to our customer and delivery of wood fiber to our mills could harm our supply chain negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and our reputation 



managing commercial timberlands risks 

our ability to harvest and deliver timber may be subject to limitations which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our primary assets are our timberlands weather conditions timber growth cycles access limitations and availability of contract loggers and haulers may adversely affect our ability to harvest our timberlands other factors that may adversely affect our timber harvest include damage to our standing timber by fire or by insect infestation disease prolonged drought flooding severe weather and other natural disasters changes in global climate conditions could intensify one or more of these factors although damage from such causes usually is localized and affects only a limited percentage of standing timber there can be no assurance that any damage affecting our timberlands will in fact be limited as is common in the forest products industry we do not maintain insurance coverage for damage to our timberlands our revenues net income and cash flow from operations are dependent to a significant extent on the pricing of our products and our continued ability to harvest timber at adequate levels therefore if we were to be restricted from harvesting on a significant portion of our timberlands for a prolonged period of time or if material damage to a significant portion of our standing timber were to occur we could suffer a materially adverse impact to our results of operations 

our timber harvest levels may be affected by acquisitions of additional timberlands sales of existing timberlands and shifts in harvest from one region to another future timber harvest levels may also be affected by our ability to timely and effectively replant harvested areas which depends on several factors including changes in estimates of longterm sustainable yield because of silvicultural advances natural disasters fires pests insects and other hazards regulatory constraints and other factors beyond our control 

timber harvest activities are also subject to a number of federal state and local regulations pertaining to the protection of fish wildlife water and other resources regulations reinterpretations and litigation can restrict timber harvest activities and increase costs examples include federal and state laws protecting threatened endangered and “atrisk” species harvesting and forestry road building activities that may be restricted under the us federal clean water act state forestry practices laws laws protecting aboriginal rights and other similar regulations 

our estimates of timber inventories and growth rates may be inaccurate and include risks inherent in calculating such estimates which may impair our ability to realize expected revenues 

whether in connection with managing our existing timberland portfolio or assessing potential timberland acquisitions we make and rely on important estimates of merchantable timber inventories these include estimates of timber inventories that may be lawfully and economically harvested timber growth rates and endproduct yields timber growth rates and yield estimates are developed by forest biometricians and other experts using statistical measurements of tree samples on given property these estimates are central to forecasting our anticipated timber harvests revenues and expected cash flows while the company has confidence in its timber inventory processes and the professionals in the field who administer it growth and yield estimates are inherently inexact and uncertain if these estimates are inaccurate our ability to manage our timberlands in a sustainable or profitable manner may be compromised which may cause our results of operations and our stock price to be adversely affected 

our operating results and cash flows will be materially affected by supply and demand for timber 

a variety of factors affect prices for timber including available supply changes in economic conditions that impact demand the level of domestic new construction and remodeling activity interest rates credit availability population growth weather conditions and pest infestation and other factors these factors vary by region by timber type ie sawlogs or pulpwood logs and by species 

timber prices are affected by changes in demand on a local national and international level the closure of a mill in a region where we own timber could have a material adverse effect on demand in that region and therefore pricing for example as the demand for paper continues to decline closures of pulp mills in some of our operating regions have adversely affected the regional demand for pulpwood and wood chips another example involves our export of logs to asia while recent demand from asian markets has remained steady some asian markets particularly in china have a history of significant volatility a decrease in demand for logs from one or more asian markets could have a negative impact on log and lumber prices 

  weyerhaeuser company  2017 annual report and form 10k   26 

  

timber prices are also affected by changes in timber availability at the local national and international level our timberland ownership is concentrated in alabama arkansas louisiana mississippi north carolina oklahoma oregon and washington in some of these states much of the timberland is privately owned increases in timber prices often result in substantial increases in harvesting on private timberlands including lands not previously made available for commercial timber operations causing a shortterm increase in supply that moderates such price increases in western states such as oregon and washington where a greater proportion of timberland is governmentowned any substantial increase in timber harvesting from governmentowned land could significantly reduce timber prices any decrease in the demand from our log export markets could also result in significant downward pressure on timber prices particularly in the western region on a local level timber supplies can fluctuate depending on factors such as changes in weather conditions and harvest strategies of local timberland owners as well as occasionally high timber salvage efforts due to events such as pest infestations fires or other natural disasters 

timberlands make up a significant portion of our business portfolio 

our real property holdings are primarily timberlands and we may make additional timberlands acquisitions in the future as the owner and manager of approximately 124 million  acres of timberlands we are subject to the risks that are inherent in concentrated real estate investments a downturn in the real estate industry generally or the timber or forest products industries specifically could reduce the value of our properties and adversely affect our results of operations such a downturn could also adversely affect our customers and reduce the demand for our products as well as our ability to realize upon our strategy of selling nonstrategic timberlands and timberland properties that have higher and better uses at attractive prices these risks may be more pronounced than if we diversified our investments outside of real property holdings 

manufacturing and selling wood products risks 

a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales or negatively affect our results of operation and financial condition 

any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

 any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products or require us to make unplanned capital expenditures if one of our facilities or machines were to incur significant downtime our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired resulting in lower sales and income although some risks are not insurable and some coverage is limited we purchase insurance protecting our manufacturing facilities from fires floods windstorms earthquakes equipment failures and boiler explosions 

some of our products are vulnerable to declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials 

our products may compete with nonfiber based alternatives or with alternative products in certain market segments for example plastic woodplastic or composite materials may be used by builders as alternatives to the products produced by our wood products businesses such as lumber veneer plywood and oriented strand board changes in prices for oil chemicals and woodbased fiber can change the competitive position of our products relative to available alternatives and could increase substitution of those products for our products if use of these alternative products grows demand for and pricing of our products could be adversely affected 

our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by changes in product mix or pricing 

our results may be materially adversely affected by a change in our product mix or pricing if we are not successful in implementing previously announced or future price increases or in our plans to increase sales of higherpriced highervalue products or if there are delays in acceptance of price increases or if customers do not accept higherpriced products our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected price discounting if required to maintain our competitive position in one or more markets could result in lower than anticipated price realizations and margins 

we face intense competition in our markets any failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we compete with north american producers and for some of our product lines global producers some of which may have greater financial resources and lower production costs than do we the principal basis for competition for many of our products is selling price our ability to maintain satisfactory margins depends in large part on our ability to control our costs our industries also are particularly sensitive to other factors including innovation design quality and service with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line to the extent that one or more of our competitors become more successful with respect to any key competitive factor our ability to attract and retain customers could be materially adversely affected any failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  weyerhaeuser company  2017 annual report and form 10k   27 

  

another emerging form of competition is between brands of sustainably produced products customer demand for certain brands could reduce competition among buyers for our products or cause other adverse effects 

in north america our forests are third partycertified to the sustainable forestry initiative sfi ®  standard some of our customers have expressed a preference in certain of our product lines for products made from raw materials sourced from forests certified to different standards including standards of the forest stewardship council fsc if and to the extent that preference for a standard other than sfi ® becomes a customer requirement there may be reduced demand and lower prices for our products relative to competitors who can supply products sourced from forests certified to competing certification standards if we seek to comply with such other standards we could incur materially increased costs for our operations or be required to modify our operations such as reducing harvest levels fsc in particular employs standards that are geographically variable and could cause a material reduction in the harvest levels of some of our timberlands most notably in the pacific northwest 

our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials and energy 

we rely heavily on certain raw materials principally wood fiber and chemicals and energy sources principally natural gas electricity and fuel oil in our manufacturing processes our ability to increase earnings has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials and energy sources we may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material or energy costs through price increases productivity improvements costreduction programs or hedging arrangements 



capital markets 

deterioration in economic conditions and capital markets could adversely affect our access to capital 

challenging market conditions could impair the company ’ s ability to raise debt or equity capital or otherwise access capital markets on terms acceptable to us which may among other impacts reduce our ability to take advantage of growth and expansion opportunities likewise our customers and suppliers may be unable to raise capital to fund their operations which could in turn adversely affect their ability to purchase products or sell products to us 

credit ratings 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results and balance sheet actions that we take their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy ratings decisions by these agencies include maintaining upgrading or downgrading our current rating as well as placing the company on a watch list for possible future ratings actions any downgrade of our credit rating or decision by a rating agency to place us on a watch list for possible future downgrading could have an adverse impact on our ability to access credit markets increase our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

capital requirements and access to capital 

our operations require substantial capital 

our businesses require substantial capital for expansion and for repair or replacement of existing facilities or equipment although we maintain our production equipment with regular scheduled maintenance key pieces of equipment may need to be repaired or replaced periodically the costs of repairing or replacing such equipment and the associated downtime of the affected production line could have a significant impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

while we believe our capital resources will be adequate to meet our current projected operating needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements if for any reason we are unable to provide for our operating needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements on acceptable economic terms we could experience a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

foreign currency 

we will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates 

we have manufacturing operations in canada we are also an exporter and compete with global producers of products very similar to ours therefore we are affected by changes in the strength of the us dollar particularly relative to the canadian dollar euro and yen and the strength of the euro relative to the yen changes in exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our sales volume margins and results of operations

environmental laws and regulations 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with violations of or liabilities under applicable environmental laws and other laws and regulations 

we are subject to a wide range of general and industryspecific laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing 

 we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations and as a result of remedial obligations we also could incur substantial costs such as civil or criminal fines sanctions and enforcement actions including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions cleanup and closure costs and thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations 

as the owner and operator of real estate we may be liable under environmental laws for cleanup closure and other damages resulting from the presence and release of hazardous substances on or from our properties or operations in addition surface water management regulations may present liabilities and are subject to change the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict and in some cases our liability may exceed forecasted amounts or the value of the property itself the discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at our sites or thirdparty sites may result in significant additional costs 

we also lease some of our properties to thirdparty operators for the purpose of exploring extracting developing and producing oil gas rock and other minerals in exchange for fees and royalty payments these activities are also subject to federal state and local laws and regulations these operations may create risk of environmental liabilities for any unlawful discharge of oil gas or other chemicals into the air soil or water generally these thirdparty operators indemnify us against any such liability and we require that that they maintain liability insurance during the term of our lease with them however if for any reason our thirdparty operators are not able to honor their indemnity obligation or if the required liability insurance were not in effect then it is possible that we could be deemed responsible for costs associated with   environmental liability caused by such thirdparty operators 

any material liability we incur as a result of activities conducted on our properties by us or by others with whom we have a business relationship could adversely affect our financial condition 

we also anticipate public policy developments at the state federal and international level regarding climate change and energy access security and competitiveness we expect these developments to address emission of carbon dioxide renewable energy and fuel standards and the monetization of carbon compliance with regulations that implement new public policy in these areas might require significant expenditures these developments may also include mandated changes to energy use and building codes which could affect our homebuilding practices enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretation of these laws or regulations might require significant expenditures we also anticipate public policy developments at the state federal and international level regarding taxes and a number of other areas that could require significant expenditures 

changes in global or regional climate conditions and governmental response to such changes at the international us federal and state levels may affect our operations or our planned or future growth activities 

there continue to be numerous international us federal and statelevel initiatives and proposals to address domestic and global climate issues within the us and canada some of these proposals would and have in some canadian provinces regulate andor tax the production of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to facilitate the reduction of carbon compound emissions into the atmosphere and provide tax and other incentives to produce and use cleaner energy climate change impacts if they occur and governmental initiatives laws and regulations to address potential climate concerns could increase our costs and have a longterm adverse impact on our businesses and results of operations future legislation or regulatory activity in this area remains uncertain and its impact on our operations is unclear at this time however it is possible that legislation or government mandates standards or regulations intended to mitigate or reduce carbon compound or greenhouse gas emissions or other climate change impacts could adversely affect our operations for example such activities could limit harvest levels or result in significantly higher costs for energy and other raw materials because our manufacturing operations depend upon significant amounts of energy and raw materials these initiatives could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and profitability 

legal matters 

we are involved in various environmental regulatory product liability and other legal matters disputes and proceedings that if determined or concluded in a manner adverse to our interests could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

we are from time to time involved in a number of legal matters disputes and proceedings “legal matters” some of which involve ongoing litigation these include without limitation legal matters involving environmental cleanup and remediation warranty and nonwarranty product liability claims regulatory issues contractual and personal injury claims and other legal matters in some cases all or a portion of any loss we experience in connection with any such legal matters will be covered by insurance in other cases any such losses will not be covered 

  weyerhaeuser company  2017 annual report and form 10k   29 

  

the outcome costs and other effects of current legal matters in which we are involved and any related insurance recoveries cannot be determined with certainty although the disclosures in note 14 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies  and note 20 income taxes  of notes to consolidated financial statements  contain management ’ s current views of the effect such legal matters could have on our financial results there can be no assurance that the outcome of such legal matters will be as currently expected it is possible that there could be adverse judgments against us in some or all major litigation matters against us and that we could be required to take a charge and make cash payments for all or a portion of any related awards of damages any one or more of such charges or cash payment could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows for the quarter or year in which we record or pay it 

reit status and tax implications 

if we fail to remain qualified as a reit our taxable income would be subject to tax at corporate rates and we would not be able to deduct dividends to shareholders 

in any taxable year in which we fail to qualify as a reit unless we are entitled to relief under the internal revenue code 

 qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code to our operations and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions although we operate in a manner consistent with the reit qualification rules we cannot assure you that we are or will remain so qualified 

certain of our business activities are subject to corporatelevel income tax and potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax 

under the internal revenue code reits generally must engage in the ownership and management of income producing real estate for the 

company this generally includes owning and managing a timberland portfolio for the production and sale of standing timber accordingly the harvesting and sale of logs the development or sale of certain timberlands and other real estate and the manufacture and sale of wood products are conducted through one or more of our whollyowned taxable reit subsidiaries trss because such activities could generate nonqualifying reit income and could constitute “prohibited transactions” prohibited transactions are defined by the internal revenue code generally to be sales or other dispositions of property to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business by conducting our business in this manner we believe that we satisfy the reit requirements of the internal revenue code and are not subject to the 100 percent tax that could be imposed if a reit were to conduct a prohibited transaction the net income of our trss is subject to corporatelevel income tax 

the extent of our use of our trss may affect the price of our common shares relative to the share price of other reits 

we conduct a significant portion of our business activities through one or more trss the use of our trss enables us to engage in nonreit qualifying business activities such as the sale of logs production and sale of wood products and the development and sale of certain higher and better use hbu property our trss are subject to corporatelevel income tax under the code no more than 20 percent of the value of the gross assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss this limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our trss’ operations furthermore our use of trss may cause the market to value our common shares differently than the shares of other reits which may not use trss as extensively as we use them 

we may be limited in our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our trss 

the ability of the reit to receive dividends from our trss is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a reit in particular at least 75 percent of gross income for each taxable year as a reit must be derived from real estate sources including sales of our standing timber and other types of qualifying real estate income and no more than 25 percent of our gross income may consist of dividends from our trss and other nonreal estate income 

this limitation on our ability to receive dividends from our trss may affect our ability to fund cash distributions to our shareholders using cash flows from our trss the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed and trs income that is not distributed to the reit will not be subject to the reit income distribution requirement 

our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate 

generally reits are required to distribute 90 percent of their ordinary taxable income and 95 percent of their net capital gains income capital gains may be retained by the reit but would be subject to corporate income taxes if capital gains are retained rather than distributed our shareholders would be notified and they would be deemed to have received a taxable distribution with a refundable credit for any federal income tax paid by the reit accordingly we believe that we are not required to distribute material amounts of cash since substantially all of our taxable income is treated as capital gains income our board of directors in its sole discretion determines the amount of quarterly dividends to be provided to our shareholders based on consideration of a number of factors these factors include but are not limited to our results of operations cash flow and capital requirements economic conditions tax considerations borrowing capacity and other factors including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments future acquisitions and divestitures harvest levels changes in the price and demand for our products and general market demand for timberlands including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses consequently our dividend levels may fluctuate 

changes in tax laws or their interpretation could adversely affect our shareholders and our results of operations 

federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process the internal revenue service the united states department of the treasury and state taxing authorities changes to tax laws could adversely affect our shareholders or increase our effective tax rates we cannot predict with certainty whether when in what forms or with what effective dates the tax laws applicable to us or our shareholders may be changed

importexport taxes and duties 

we may be required to pay significant taxes on our exported products or countervailing and antidumping duties on our imported products 

we export logs and finished wood products to foreign markets and our ability to do so profitably is affected by us and foreign trade policy international trade disputes occur frequently and can be taken to an international trade court for resolution of unfair trade practices between countries for example there have been many disputes and subsequent trade agreements regarding sales of softwood lumber between canada historically a significant source of lumber for the us market and the united states the softwood lumber agreement sla between canada and the us originally signed in october 2006 expired in october 2015 and a new agreement has not been reached the prior agreement imposed a sliding scale export tax on canadian lumber exported to the us when the price of lumber was at or below a threshold price in november 2016 a coalition of us lumber producers filed petitions seeking countervailing and antidumping duties on canadian lumber on the basis of the us international trade commissions affirmative finding of injury to us lumber producers the us department of commerce recently imposed final antidumping and countervailing duties at a combined rate of 2023 on most canadian softwood lumber exporters 

for more information regarding the status of the softwood lumber agreement and any us government regulatory action regarding imposition of countervailing and antidumping duties or other actions and the effect of any such actions on our business see the discussion in the managements discussion and analysis  softwood lumber agreement  section of this report 

us international trade policy could result in one or more of our foreign export market jurisdictions adopting responsive trade policy making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries we could therefore experience reduced revenues and margins in any of our businesses that is adversely affected by international trade tariffs duties taxes customs or dispute settlement terms to the extent such trade policies increase prices they could also reduce the demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial results and financial condition including facility closures or impairments of assets we cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any settlements of international trade disputes and their impact on our business 

distribution of wreco shares 

we could incur substantial us federal tax liability if the wreco transaction were found not to qualify as a taxfree “reorganization” or the distribution of wreco shares to weyerhaeuser shareholders were found not to qualify as a taxfree distribution 

in 2014 we closed the divestiture of our home building business weyerhaeuser real estate company wreco via a reverse morris trust transaction pursuant to which a wholly  owned subsidiary of tri pointe homes inc tri pointe merged with and into wreco with wreco surviving the merger and becoming a wholly  owned subsidiary of tri pointe the reverse morris trust transaction was structured to qualify as a taxfree reorganization and the associated distribution of wreco shares to weyerhaeuser shareholders as a taxfree distribution if the transaction were determined not to qualify as a taxfree reorganization   or if the distribution does not qualify as a taxfree distribution then weyerhaeuser or its subsidiaries or weyerhaeuser shareholders may be required to pay substantial us federal income taxes 

if the transaction were determined not to qualify as a taxfree reorganization or the distribution not to qualify as a taxfree distribution or if weyerhaeuser were required to indemnify tri pointe and wreco such taxes and indemnification obligations could be substantial and could materially and adversely affect the company’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

our merger with plum creek timber company inc 

we could incur substantial us federal tax liability in connection with our merger with plum creek 

on february 19 2016 plum creek timber company inc merged with and into weyerhaeuser company with weyerhaeuser continuing as the surviving company both companies have operated in a manner intended to qualify them as “reits” for us federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code see “reit status and tax implications” above for a description of the consequences of our failure to maintain reit status however even if we have operated in a manner that allows us to retain our reit status if plum creek were deemed to have lost its reit status for a taxable year before the merger or the taxable year in which the merger occurred we could face serious tax consequences that could substantially reduce cash available for distribution to our shareholders and significantly impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital in addition if the merger were determined not to qualify as a taxfree merger we could incur substantial federal tax liability that could materially and adversely affect the companys cash flows financial condition and results of operations 



cybersecurity 

we rely on information technology to support our operations and reporting environments a security failure of that technology could impact our ability to operate our businesses effectively adversely affect our reported financial results impact our reputation and expose us to potential liability or litigation 

we use information systems to carry out our operational activities maintain our business records collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property other proprietary and personally identifiable information some systems are internally managed and some are maintained by thirdparty service providers we and our service providers employ what we believe are reasonably adequate security measures but notwithstanding these efforts our systems could be compromised as a result of a cyber incident natural disaster hardware or software corruption failure or error telecommunications system failure service provider error or failure intentional or unintentional personnel actions or other disruption if by any cause our systems or information resources were compromised or if our data were destroyed misappropriated or inappropriately disclosed we could suffer significant loss or incur significant liability including damage to our reputation loss of customer confidence or goodwill and significant expenditures of time and money to address and remediate resulting damages to affected individuals or business partners or to defend ourselves in resulting litigation or other legal proceedings by affected individuals business partners or regulators

pension plan liability 

we have a significant pension liability 

a portion of our current and former employees have accrued benefits under our defined benefit pension plans although the plans are not open to employees hired on or after january 1 2014 current employees hired before that time continue to accrue benefits requirements for funding our pension plan liabilities are based on a number of actuarial assumptions including the expected rate of return on our plan assets and the discount rate applied to our pension plan obligations fluctuations in equity market returns and changes in longterm interest rates could increase our costs under our plans and may significantly impact future contribution requirements it is unknown what the actual investment return on our pension assets will be in future years and what interest rates may be at any given point in time we cannot therefore provide any assurance of what our actual pension plan costs will be in the future or whether we will be required under applicable law to make future material plan contributions see note 9 pension and other postretirement benefit plans  of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about these plans including funding status 

strategic initiatives 

our business and financial results may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully execute on important strategic initiatives   

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results these strategic initiatives are designed to improve our results of operations and drive longterm shareholder value and include among others optimizing cash flow through operational excellence reducing costs to achieve industryleading cost structure and innovating in highermargin products  

we may be unsuccessful in carrying out our acquisition strategy 

we intend to strategically pursue acquisitions of timberland properties when market conditions warrant as with any investment our acquisitions may not perform in accordance with our expectations in addition we anticipate financing such acquisitions through cash from operations borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities proceeds from equity or debt offerings or proceeds from asset dispositions or any combination thereof our inability to finance future acquisitions on favorable terms could adversely affect our results of operations 

people 

our business is dependent upon attracting retaining and developing key personnel 

our success depends to a significant extent upon our ability to attract retain and develop senior management operations management and other key personnel our financial condition or results of operations could be significantly adversely affected if we were to fail to recruit retain and develop such personnel or if there were to occur any significant increase in the cost of providing such personnel with competitive total compensation and benefits 

stockprice volatility 

the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors some of which are beyond our control 

the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors some of which are beyond our control including without limitation those described above and elsewhere in this report as well as the following 

 in addition there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in the forest products industry that often has been unrelated to individual company operating performance 

some companies that have experienced volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them if litigation of this type is brought against us it could result in substantial costs and divert management ’ s attention and resources

our mda includes the following major sections 

 



the demand for logs within our timberlands segment is directly affected by production levels of domestic woodbased building products this segment specifically the western region is also affected by export demand japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in japan the strength of the us housing market strongly affects demand in our wood products segment as does repair and remodeling activity 

according to the us census bureau housing starts in 2017 totaled 12 million units single family units accounted for 08 million of total housing starts year to date increasing the share of single family units to 71 percent of total housing starts compared with 67 percent in 2016 while total housing start growth slowed in 2017 rising by a modest 24 percent overall there has been a shift in construction away from multifamily units which are down 10 percent year over year to single family units which have increased 9 percent over the same period this shift to the more wood intensive single family construction has been positive for wood products demand we continue to expect improving us housing starts and anticipate a 4 percent to 10 percent increase in total starts in 2018 consensus forecasts place expected total housing starts between 125 and 131 million units for 2018 sources include national association of home builders nahb fannie mae mortgage bankers association the engineered wood association apa and forest economic advisors llc fea demand for homes remains strong relative to inventories us census reported new homes sales of 608   thousand units in 2017 an increase of 84 percent over 2016 this sales level was characterized by consistently low inventories as measured by months of supply which averaged 54 months through 2017 existing home sales continued to rise in 2017 with total sales of 551 million units a gain of 11 percent over 2016 and the highest sales level since 2006 according to the national association of realtors existing home inventories were also tight with supplies averaging 39   months for the year down from 43 months in 2016 we attribute this continued improvement primarily to employment growth improving consumer confidence and favorable mortgage rates 

according to the joint center for housing studies at harvard university the leading indicator of remodeling activity lira increased by 64 percent in 2017 and is expected to increase by 75 percent year over year for 2018 

us wood product markets advanced in 2017 consistent with growth in homebuilding and remodeling segments as described above according to fea north american lumber consumption grew at a 72 percent rate in 2017 the random lengths framing lumber composite price increased 194 percent in 2017 versus 2016 while oriented strand board osb increased 31 percent in 2017 versus 2016 as measured by random lengths north central price we expect similar to slightly higher wood product prices in 2018 as demand continues to increase with growth in housing starts and remodeling 

consistent with this demand for logs increased with wood products production within our western region this coupled with higher market prices year over year drove higher realizations within this region douglas fir sawlog prices as reported by loglines increased 10 percent from 2016 for the domestic market and 57 percent for japan export logs in the south log supplies increased consistent with increased demand leaving prices flat to slightly down yearoveryear according to timbermart  south prices for delivered sawtimber and stumpage were down 26 percent and 46 percent respectively 

log inventories in chinese ports have been stable through 2017 ranging from 10 million to 15 million cubic meters m 3  per month as reported by international wood markets china bulletin log and lumber demand in china remain strong primarily due to the strength of construction activity total imports of logs and lumber increased 13 percent and 20 percent respectively for the first 11 months of 2017 compared on a year ago basis in japan post and beam housing starts the primary source of log demand for january through november 2017 are up 10 percent from the same period last year while total housing starts are down 01 percent on a year ago basis 

we expect demand from china and japan in 2018 to be similar to modestly improved from demand experienced in 2017 

our real estate energy and natural resources segment is affected by the health of the us economy and especially the us housing sector of the economy according to the realtors land institute of the national association of realtors the dollar volume of rural properties including timber sold in 2017 grew 4 percent over 2016 sales while per acre prices were up 3 percent on average 

energy markets recovered steadily in 2017 for the year brent crude oil averaged 54 per barrel in 2017 an increase of 10 per barrel from 2016 levels prices increased fairly steadily through the second half of the year with yearend prices higher than the annual average natural gas prices were also higher in 2017 averaging 299 per million british thermal units mmbtu a 19 percent increase over 2016 expectations are for energy prices to be stable to gradually increasing in 2018

we operate a total of 19 softwood lumber mills with a total capacity of 49 billion board feet three of these mills located in canada produce approximately 900 million board feet annually and sell products in canada asia and the us 

on april 24 2017 the us department of commerce announced a preliminary determination that it would implement countervailing duties on canadian softwood lumber shipments to the us the rate applicable to weyerhaeuser was 1988 percent and became effective as of april 28 2017 the us department of commerce also announced that retroactive deposits at the 1988 percent rate would be collected from certain canadian lumber producers including weyerhaeuser for softwood lumber shipments from canada to the us during the 90day period prior to april 28 2017 

the preliminary countervailing duties were suspended on august 26 2017 at which time we effectively stopped accruing for the expense the suspension of the countervailing duties was set to last until the us international trade commission reaches its final determination of injury which was issued december 28 2017 

on june 26 2017 the us department of commerce announced a preliminary determination that it would implement antidumping duties on canadian softwood lumber shipments to the us the rate applicable to weyerhaeuser was 687 percent and became effective as of june 30 2017 the us department of commerce also announced that retroactive deposits at the 687 percent rate would be collected from certain canadian lumber producers including weyerhaeuser for softwood lumber shipments from canada to the us during the 90day period prior to june 30 2017 

based on affirmative final determinations by the department of commerce doc and the us international trade commission usitc on december 28 2017 the doc issued countervailing duty cvd and antidumping ad duty orders on certain softwood lumber products from canada 

the cvd rate applicable to weyerhaeuser is 1419 percent and will be assessed on entries of softwood lumber from canada for consumption on or after april 28 2017 the date of publication of the preliminary determination it will not include entries occurring after the expiration of the provisional measures period and before publication of the itc’s final injury determination cvd suspension date was august 26 2017  december 27 2017 

the ad rate applicable to weyerhaeuser is 604 percent and will be assessed on entries of softwood lumber from canada for consumption on or after june 30 2017 the date of publication of the preliminary determination it will not include entries occurring after the expiration of the provisional measures period until and through the day preceding the day of publication of the usitc’s final injury determinations in the federal register ad suspension date was december 26 2017  january 2 2018 

for retroactive imposition of cvd and ad duties to apply 90 days prior to the dates of publication of the preliminary determinations both the usitc and doc must make a positive determination the usitc made a negative determination regarding critical circumstances on december 7 2017 as a result we reversed the accrual for the retroactive duties for both cvd and ad which totaled 9 million  additionally we reduced our accrual by 2 million  related to reduced rate applicable to prospective period duties as of december 31 2017 we have expensed cvd and ad duties at the final published rates totaling 7 million  



in reviewing our results of operations it is important to understand these terms 

 our merger with plum creek during first quarter 2016 significantly affected the comparability of our consolidated operating results between 2016 and prior periods as a result of progress made to integrate financial processes and systems since the merger date the results beginning on february 19 2016 from acquired plum creek operations and the respective impacts of these results on our current period results are impracticable to disclose in the yeartodate period ended december 31 2016 our prior period results do not include premerger results of plum creek operations

comparing 2016  with 2015 

compared to 2015 the changes to the results of operations for our timberlands segment during 2016 are primarily attributable to the addition of approximately 63 million acres of plum creek timberlands which produced over 18 million tons of harvest volume in 2015 the merger resulted in the expansion of our southern timberlands from 40 million acres to 74 million acres — an 85 percent increase — and our western timberlands from 26 to 30 million acres — a 15 percent increase the merger also added 25 million acres across maine michigan montana new hampshire vermont west virginia and wisconsin which we refer to collectively as our northern timberlands increases to sales volume are primarily attributable to the significant increases in the overall size of and harvests from our timberlands holdings by region particularly in the south and north regions 

the composition of our sales volume by region was also altered by the merger as the south and north regions which historically had lower average sales realizations compared to the west comprise a greater portion of our overall sales subsequent to the merger additionally within the south the acquired timberlands altered the overall sales mix as lower realization pulpwood sales increased and higher realization grade logs decreased as a percentage of total sales volume resulting in lower average sales realizations overall for the region in 2016 compared with 2015 

as a result of applying acquisition accounting to our timber and timberland assets acquired as described in note 4 merger with plum creek  in notes to consolidated financial statements  depletion rates increased significantly in 2016 compared to 2015 when combined with increased sales volume these higher depletion rates drove significant increases in our costs of products sold in 2016 compared to 2015

the increase in the united states intersegment sales was partially offset by a 21 million  decrease in intersegment sales in canada this decrease is attributable to lower log and chip sales volume to our former cellulose fibers segment as a result of divesting from our pulp mill in grande prairie alberta there was also a slight decrease in average intersegment sales realizations compared to 2015 

costs of products sold 

costs of products sold increased 488 million  — 31 percent  — primarily due to a 78 percent increase in sales volume attributable to the operations acquired in our merger with plum creek additionally per unit costs increased due to higher depletion rates in the south and west attributable to acquired plum creek timberlands which were measured at fair value as of the merger date 

operating income and net contribution to earnings 

net contribution to earnings increased 29 million  — 6 percent  — primarily attributable to the changes in net sales and costs of products sold as explained above

we are required to pay corporate income taxes on earnings of our trss which includes our wood products segment and portions of our timberlands and real estate  enr segments earnings our provision for income taxes is primarily driven by earnings generated by our trss overall performance results for our business segments can be found in results of operationstimberlands  results of operationsreal estate energy and natural resources  and results of operationswood products  

on december 22 2017 hr 1 commonly known as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act was enacted the tax act contains significant changes to corporate taxation including the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent increased deductions for capital spending and limitations on interest expense deductions the tax act does not affect our reit status or the provisions that allow us to pay capital gain dividends to our shareholders 

as a result of the reduction in the corporate tax rate we have revalued our deferred tax assets and liabilities and have recorded a tax expense of 74 million during 2017 which reduced our net deferred tax asset 

for 2018 we expect our effective tax rate will be between 11 percent and 13 percent the estimated range is based on current assumptions with respect to our earnings and the tax act our actual effective tax rate in 2018 may differ the reduced effective tax rate is expected to result in overall lower tax expense beginning in 2018

critical accounting policies 

in the preparation of our financial statements we follow established accounting policies and make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets liabilities revenues and expenses some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position are considered critical accounting policies 

in accounting we base our judgments and estimates on 

 actual results however may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded 

our most critical accounting policies relate to our 

 details about our other significant accounting policies — what we use and how we estimate — are in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements

pension and postretirement benefit plans   

we sponsor several pension and postretirement benefit plans for our employees key assumptions we use in accounting for the plans include our 

 at the end of every year we review our assumptions with external advisers and make adjustments as appropriate we use these assumptions to calculate liability information as of yearend and pension and post retirement expense for the following year actual experience that differs from our assumptions or any changes in our assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

other factors that affect our accounting for the plans include 

 this section provides more information about our 

 expected longterm rate of return on plan assets 

plan assets are assets of the pension plan trusts that fund the benefits provided under the pension plans the expected longterm rate of return is our estimate of the longterm rate of return that our plan assets will earn our expected longterm rate of return is important in determining the net periodic benefit or cost we recognize for our plans 

over the 33 years  it has been in place our us pension trust investment strategy has achieved a 137 percent  net compound annual return rate 

after considering available information at the end of 2016 we determined that it was appropriate to reduce our assumption of longterm rate of return on plan assets used in determining net periodic benefit cost from 90 percent for the year ended december 31 2016 to 80 percent  for the year ended december 31 2017 based on the information available at the end of 2017 we determined that it is appropriate to continue to use the 80 percent  return on plan assets assumption during 2018 

factors we considered include 

 our expected longterm rate of return is important in determining the net periodic benefit or cost we recognize for our plans every 50 basis point decrease in our expected longterm rate of return would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately 

 the actual return on plan assets in any given year may vary from our expected longterm rate of return actual returns on plan assets affect the funded status of the plans differences between actual returns on plan assets and the expected longterm rate of return are reflected as adjustments to cumulative other comprehensive income loss a component of total equity 

discount rates 

our discount rates as of december 31 2017  are 

 we review our discount rates annually and revise them as needed the discount rates are selected at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of highquality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits 

pension and postretirement benefit expenses for 2018  will be based on the 37 percent  and 35 percent  assumed discount rates for us plans and 35 percent  and 34 percent  assumed discount rates for the canadian plans 

our discount rates are important in determining the cost of our plans a 50 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately 

 longlived assets 

we review the carrying value of our longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations the carrying value is the amount assigned to longlived assets in our financial statements 

an impairment occurs when the carrying value of longlived assets will not be recovered from future cash flows and is more than fair market value fair market value is the estimated amount we would receive if we were to sell the assets 

  weyerhaeuser company  2017 annual report and form 10k   53 

  

in determining fair market value and whether impairment has occurred we are required to estimate 

 key assumptions we use in developing the estimates include 

 contingent liabilities 

we are subject to lawsuits investigations and other claims related to environmental product and other matters and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 

we record contingent liabilities when 

 assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors including 

 in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that an ultimate loss may occur 

while we do our best in developing our projections recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain if estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges these exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flow in any given quarter or year see note 14 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for more information 

timber depletion 

we record depletion the costs attributed to timber harvested as trees are harvested 

to calculate our depletion rates which are updated annually we 

 

estimating the volume of timber available for harvest over the harvest cycle requires consideration of the following factors 

 

in addition the duration of the harvest cycle varies by geographic region and species of timber 

depletion rate calculations do not include estimates for 

 

a 5 percent decrease in our estimate of future harvest volumes would have 

 business combinations 

we recognize identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair value goodwill if any as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed while we use our best estimates and assumptions for the purchase price allocation process to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to any goodwill previously recorded or to earnings in the event that no goodwill was previously recorded to the extent that we identify adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation beginning january 1 2016 we adopted asu 201516 which eliminates the requirements to retrospectively apply measurement period adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation and revise comparative information on the income statement and balance sheet for any prior periods affected we will recognize measurement period adjustments and any resulting effect on earnings during the period in which the adjustment is identified upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final

competition in our markets 

we operate in highly competitive domestic and foreign markets with numerous companies selling similar products many of our products also face competition from substitutes for wood products we compete in our markets primarily through product quality service levels and price we are relentlessly focused on improving operational excellence to ensure a competitive cost structure and producing quality products customers want and are willing to pay for 

our business segments’ competitive strategies are as follows 

 

sales outside the us

  weyerhaeuser company  2016 annual report and form 10k   2 

  



this section provides information about how we 

 for each of our business segments we provide details about what we do where we do it how much we sell and where we are headed 

timberlands 

our timberlands segment manages 131 million  acres of private commercial timberlands worldwide we own 120 million  of those acres and have longterm leases on the other 11 million  acres in addition we have renewable longterm licenses on 139 million  acres of canadian timberlands the tables presented in this section include data from this segments business units as of the end of 2016  

what we do 

forestry management 

our timberlands segment 

 our goal is to maximize returns by selling logs and stumpage to internal and external customers we focus on solid wood and use intensive silviculture to improve forest productivity and returns while managing our forests on a sustainable basis to meet customer needs and public expectations 

sustainable forestry practices 

we are committed to responsible environmental stewardship wherever we operate managing forests to produce financially mature timber while protecting the ecosystem services they provide our working forests include places with unique environmental cultural historical or recreational value to protect their unique qualities we follow regulatory requirements voluntary standards and implement the sustainable forestry initiative ®  sfi standard independent auditing of all of the forests we own or manage in the united states and canada certifies that we meet the sfi standard our timberlands in uruguay are certified under the forest stewardship council fsc standard or the uruguayan national forestry management standard which is endorsed by the program for the endorsement of forest certification pefc 

canadian forestry operations 

in canada we manage timberlands under longterm licenses that provide raw material for our manufacturing facilities in various provinces when we harvest trees we pay the provinces at stumpage rates set by the government which generally are based on prevailing market prices we transfer logs to our manufacturing facilities at cost and do not generate any profit in the timberlands segment from the harvest of timber from the licensed acres in canada 

timberlands products 

how we measure our product 

we previously reported timberlands volumes information in cubic meters prior period volumes have been converted from cubic meters to tons using conversion factors as follows 

 we also use multiple units of measure when transacting business including 



  weyerhaeuser company  2016 annual report and form 10k   3 

  

where we do it 

our timberlands assets are located primarily in north america in the us we own and manage sustainable timberlands in twenty states for use in wood products manufacturing we own or lease 

 

included in the acreage above is the approximately 63 million acres of timberlands added through our merger with plum creek which produced over 18 million tons of harvest volume in 2015 the merger resulted in the addition of the following acres 

 in uruguay we own 299000  acres and have longterm leases on 10000  acres in canada we manage timberlands under longterm licenses that provide raw material for our manufacturing facilities these licenses are in alberta british columbia ontario license is managed by partnership and saskatchewan 

our total timber inventory — including timber on owned and leased land— is approximately 645 million  tons the amount of timber inventory does not translate into an amount of lumber or panel products because the quantity of end products varies according to the species size and quality of the timber and will change through time as the mix of these variables adjust 

the species size and grade of the trees affects the relative value of our timberlands 

we maintain our timber inventory in an integrated resource inventory and geographic information system “gis” the resource inventory component of the system is proprietary and is largely based on internally developed technologies including growth and yield models developed by our research and development organization the gis component is based on gis software that is viewed as the standard in our industry 

timber inventory data collection and verification techniques include the use of industry standard field sampling procedures as well as proprietary remote sensing technologies in some geographies where they generate improved estimates the data is collected and maintained at the timber stand level 

we also own and operate nurseries and seed orchards in arkansas georgia louisiana mississippi oregon south carolina and washington

summary of 2016  timberland locations 



we provide a constant year round flow of logs to internal and thirdparty customers we sell grade logs to mills that manufacture a diverse range of products including lumber plywood and veneer we also sell standing timber to third parties our timberlands are well located to take advantage of road logging and transportation systems for efficient delivery of logs to these customers 

western united states 

our western acres are well situated to serve the wood product markets in oregon and washington additionally our location on the west coast provides access to highervalue export markets for douglas fir and whitewood logs to japan china and korea the size and quality of our western timberlands coupled with their proximity to several deepwater port facilities positions us to meet the needs of pacific rim log markets 

our holdings are composed primarily of douglas fir a species highly valued for its structural strength our coastal holdings also contain whitewood and have a higher proportion of hemlock and other whitewoods than our western interior holdings our management systems provide us a competitive operating advantage in the areas of research and forestry to technical planning models mechanized harvesting and marketing and logistics

2016  western us inventory by age  species 

the average age of timber harvested from our western timberlands in 2016  was 52 years most of our western timberlands are intensively managed for timber production but some areas are conserved for environmental andor recreational reasons some of our older trees are protected in acreage set aside for conservation and some are not yet logged due to harvest rate regulations while over the long term our average harvest age will decrease in accordance with our sustainable forestry practices we harvest approximately 2 percent of our western acreage each year 

southern united states 

our southern forests predominantly contain southern yellow pine and include timberlands in 11 states 

we intensively manage our timber plantations using forestry research and planning systems to optimize grade log production we do this while providing quality habitat for a range of animals and birds we lease more than 92 percent of our southern acreage for recreational purposes

2016  northern us inventory by age  species 

the average age of timber harvested from our northern timberlands in 2016  was 66 years timber harvested in the north is sold predominately as delivered logs to domestic mills including our manufacturing facilities located in montana and west virginia in accordance with our sustainable forestry practices we harvest less than 1 percent of our acreage each year in the north 

uruguay 

our timberland acres in uruguay are split approximately 49 percent loblolly pine and 51 percent eucalyptus loblolly pine comprises more of our timber inventory due to its older age on average our timber in uruguay is in the second third of its rotation age it is entering into that part of the growth rotation when we will see increased volume about 98 percent of the area to be planted has been afforested to date 

  weyerhaeuser company  2016 annual report and form 10k   7 

  

2016  uruguay inventory by species 

in uruguay the target rotation ages are 21 to 22 years for pine and 14 to 17 years for eucalyptus we manage both species to a grade appearance regime 

we also operate a plywood mill in uruguay with a production capacity of approximately 260 thousand cubic meters mill operations are included in our timberlands business segment production volume reached 228 thousand cubic meters in 2016  

on october 12 2016 we announced the exploration of strategic alternatives for our timberlands and manufacturing operations in uruguay we intend to consider a broad range of alternatives including continuing to hold and operate the business or a sale 

canada — licensed timberlands 

we manage timberlands in canada under longterm licenses from the provincial governments to secure volume for our manufacturing facilities in various provinces the provincial governments regulate the volume of timber that may be harvested each year through annual allowable cuts aac which are updated every 10 years as of december 31 2016  our aac by province was 

 when the volume is harvested we pay the province at stumpage rates set by the government the harvested logs are transferred to our manufacturing facilities at cost stumpage plus harvest haul and overhead costs less any margin on selling logs to third parties any profit from harvesting the log through to converting to finished products is recognized at the respective mill in our wood products segment 

a small amount of harvested volumes are sold to unaffiliated customers 



  weyerhaeuser company  2016 annual report and form 10k   8 

  

how much we harvest 

our fee harvest volumes are managed sustainably across all regions to ensure the preservation of longterm economic value of the timber and to capture maximum value from the markets this is accomplished by ensuring annual harvest schedules target financially mature timber and reforestation activities align with the growing of timber through its life cycle to financial maturity

log sales volume 

logs sold to unaffiliated customers in 2016  increased 116 million  tons — 73 percent  — from 2015  

 we sell three grades of logs — domestic grade domestic fiber and export factors that may affect log sales in each of these categories include 

 our sales volume includes logs purchased in the open market and all our domestic and export logs that are sold to unaffiliated customers or transferred at market prices to our internal mills 

fiveyear summary of log sales volume to unaffiliated customers 



log prices 

the majority of our log sales to unaffiliated customers involve sales to domestic sawmills and the export market log prices in the following tables are on a delivered mill basis

  weyerhaeuser company  2016 annual report and form 10k   11 

  

fiveyear summary of export log prices 2 sawlog bark on — mbf 

our log prices are affected by the supply of and demand for grade and fiber logs and are influenced by the same factors that affect log sales export log prices are particularly affected by the japanese housing market and chinese demand 

our average 2016  log realizations in the west decreased by 2 percent compared to 2015  — primarily due to grade mix and export vs domestic sales mix 

our average 2016  log realizations in the south decreased by 5 percent compared to 2015  — primarily as a result of lower realization pulpwood sales having increased and higher realization grade logs having decreased as a percentage of total sales volume the change in mix is attributable to the addition of acquired plum creek timberlands that have historically produced a higher proportion of pulpwood vs grade logs compared to legacy weyerhaeuser timberlands 

where we’re headed 

our competitive strategies include 

 

real estate energy and natural resources 

our real estate  enr segment maximizes the value of our timberland ownership through application of our asset value optimization avo process and captures the full value of surface and subsurface assets through development of oil natural gas minerals and wind resources 

what we do 

real estate 

properties that exhibit higher value than commercial timberlands are monetized within our real estate business we analyze existing us timberland holdings using a process we call asset value optimization we start with understanding the value of a parcel operating as commercial timberlands and then assess the specific real estate attributes of the parcel and its corresponding market the assessment includes demographics infrastructure and proximity to amenities and recreation to determine the potential to yield a premium value to commercial timberland attributes can evolve over time and accordingly the assignment of value and opportunity can change 

the assessment includes third party experts and results in a categorization of properties with potential premium values these properties are acres we expect to sell exchange andor develop for recreational conservation commercial or residential purposes development is conducted using internal resources or through thirdparty arrangements 

occasionally we enter into small opportunistic timberlands transactions in areas where we choose to reduce our market presence or we can capture a price that exceeds the value derivable from holding and operating as commercial timberlands these transactions will vary based on factors including the locations and physical characteristics of the timberlands 

the timing of real estate sales is a function of many factors including the general state of the economy demand in local real estate markets the ability to obtain entitlements the ability of buyers to obtain financing the number of competing properties listed for sale the seasonal nature of sales particularly in the northern states the plans of adjacent landowners our expectation of future price appreciation the timing of the harvesting activities and the availability of government and notforprofit funding especially for conservation sales in any period the average sales price per acre will vary based on the location and physical characteristics of parcels sold 

  weyerhaeuser company  2016 annual report and form 10k   12 

  

energy and natural resources 

in the united states we analyze and manage mineral oil and gas and renewable energy opportunities on our timberlands we recognize leasing bonus and option revenue over the terms of agreements with buyers revenue primarily comes from 

 we generate revenue related to our ownership of mineral rights and separately related to our ownership of the surface the ownership of mineral rights and surface rights may be held by two separate parties materials that can be mined from the surface and whose value comes from factors other than their chemical composition typically belong to the surface owner examples of surface materials include rock sand and gravel the mineral rights owner holds the title to commodities that derive value from their unique chemical composition examples of mineral rights include oil gas coal even if mined at the surface and precious metals if the two types of rights conflict then mineral rights generally are superior to surface rights a third type of land right is geothermal which can belong to either the surface or mineral owner we generally reserve mineral and geothermal rights when selling surface timberlands acreage 

we expect to continue to negotiate royalty arrangements and leases to capture the maximum value for our nontimber natural resources assets some of these activities are conducted through our whollyowned taxable reit subsidiaries 

real estate development joint venture 

our share of equity earnings from westrockcharleston land partners llc wrclp are included in the net contribution to earnings of our real estate  enr segment wrclp develops and sells its acreage of high value rural lands and developmentquality lands near charleston south carolina refer to note 8 related parties  in notes to consolidated financial statements  for further information 

real estate energy and natural resources sources of revenue 



certain activities within this segment are performed by our reit whereas others are activities of our taxable reit subsidiaries 

where we do it 

our real estate  enr segment identifies opportunities to realize premium value for our us timberland acreage 

the avo review of our legacy weyerhaeuser southern timberlands was completed in fourth quarter 2016 the avo review of our legacy weyerhaeuser western timberlands is currently underway and is expected to be completed in 2017 beyond initially applying the avo process to legacy weyerhaeuser timberlands we will continually revisit our avo assessment of all of our us timberland acres including acreage acquired in our merger with plum creek that was subjected to the avo process prior to the merger 

our significant energy and natural resources revenue sources are generated from construction materials royalties in south carolina and georgia oil and natural gas royalties in west virginia and louisiana and coal reserves in west virginia

we are subject to a multitude of laws and regulations in the operation of our businesses we also participate in voluntary certification of our timberlands to ensure that we sustain their overall quality including the protection of wildlife and water quality changes in law and regulation or certification standards can significantly affect our business 

regulations affecting forestry practices 

in the united states regulations established by federal state and local government agencies to protect water quality and wetlands could affect future harvests and forest management practices on our timberlands forest practice laws and regulations that affect present or future harvest and forest management activities in certain states include 

 each state in which we own timberlands has developed best management practices to reduce the effects of forest practices on water quality and aquatic habitats additional and more stringent regulations may be adopted by various state and local governments to achieve waterquality standards under the federal clean water act protect fish and wildlife habitats human health or achieve other public policy objectives 

in canada our forest operations are carried out on public timberlands under forest licenses with the provinces all forest operations are subject to 

    protect environmental values and 

    encourage other stewardship values 

in canada 21 member companies of the forest products association of canada fpac including weyerhaeuser ’ s canadian subsidiary announced in may 2010 the signing of a canadian boreal forest agreement cbfa with nine environmental organizations the cbfa applies to approximately 72 million hectares of public forests licensed to fpac members and when fully implemented is expected to lead to the conservation of significant areas of canada ’ s boreal forest and protection of boreal species at risk in particular woodland caribou cbfa signatories continue to work on management plans with provincial governments and seek the participation of aboriginal and local communities in advancing the goals of the cbfa progress under the cbfa is measured and reported on by an independent auditor 

endangered species protections 

in the united states a number of fish and wildlife species that inhabit geographic areas near or within our timberlands have been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal endangered species act esa or similar state laws such as 

 additional species or populations may be listed as threatened or endangered as a result of pending or future citizen petitions or petitions initiated by federal or state agencies in addition significant citizen litigation seeks to compel the federal agencies to designate critical habitat for esalisted species and many cases have resulted in settlements under which designations will be implemented over time such designations may adversely affect some management activities and options restrictions on timber harvests can result from 

 

such actions could increase our operating costs and affect timber supply and prices in general to date we do not believe that these measures have had and we do not believe that in 2017  they will have a significant effect on our harvesting operations we anticipate that likely future actions will not disproportionately affect weyerhaeuser as compared with comparable operations of us competitors 

in canada 

 

the identification and protection of habitat and the implementation of range plans and land use action plans may over time result in additional restrictions on timber harvests and other forest management practices that could increase operating costs for operators of timberlands in canada to date we do not believe that these canadian measures have had and we do not believe that in 2017  they will have a significant effect on our harvesting operations we anticipate that likely future measures will not disproportionately affect weyerhaeuser as compared with similar operations of canadian competitors 

  weyerhaeuser company  2016 annual report and form 10k   19 

  

forest certification standards 

we operate in north america under the sustainable forestry initiative sfi ®  this is a certification standard designed to supplement government regulatory programs with voluntary landowner initiatives to further protect certain public resources and values sfi ®  is an independent standard overseen by a governing board consisting of 

 ongoing compliance with sfi ®  may result in some increases in our operating costs and curtailment of our timber harvests in some areas there also is competition from other private certification systems primarily the forest stewardship council fsc coupled with efforts by supporters to further those systems by persuading customers of forest products to require products certified to their preferred system certain features of the fsc system could impose additional operating costs on timberland management because of the considerable variation in fsc standards and variability in how those standards are interpreted and applied if sufficient marketplace demand develops for products made from raw materials sourced from other than sficertified forests we could incur substantial additional costs for operations and be required to reduce harvest levels 

what these regulations and certification programs mean to us 

the regulatory and nonregulatory forest management programs described above have 

 we believe that these kinds of programs have not had and in 2017  will not have a significant effect on our total harvest of timber in the united states or canada however these kinds of programs may have such an effect in the future we expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these programs as compared with typical owners of comparable timberlands we also expect that these programs will not significantly disrupt our planned operations over large areas or for extended periods 

canadian aboriginal rights 

many of the canadian timberlands are subject to the constitutionally protected treaty or commonlaw rights of aboriginal peoples of canada most of british columbia bc is not covered by treaties and as a result the claims of bc’s aboriginal peoples relating to forest resources have been largely unresolved on june 26 2014 the supreme court of canada ruled that the tsilhqot’in nation holds aboriginal title to approximately 1900 square kilometers in bc this was the first time that the court has declared title to exist based on historical occupation by aboriginal peoples many aboriginal groups continue to be engaged in treaty discussions with the governments of bc other provinces and canada 

final or interim resolution of claims brought by aboriginal groups can be expected to result in 

 we believe that such claims will not have a significant effect on our total harvest of timber or production of forest products in 2017  although they may have such an effect in the future in 2008 fpac of which we are a member signed a memorandum of understanding with the assembly of first nations under which the parties agree to work together to strengthen canada ’ s forest sector through economicdevelopment initiatives and business investments strong environmental stewardship and the creation of skilldevelopment opportunities particularly targeted to aboriginal youth 

pollutioncontrol regulations 

our operations are subject to various laws and regulations including 

 these laws and regulations as well as market demands impose controls with regard to 

 compliance with these laws regulations and demands usually involves capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs we cannot easily quantify the future amounts of capital expenditures we might have to make to comply with these laws regulations and demands or the effects on our operating costs because in some instances compliance standards have not been developed or have not become final or definitive in addition it is difficult to isolate the environmental component of most manufacturing capital projects 

  weyerhaeuser company  2016 annual report and form 10k   20 

  

our capital projects typically are designed to 

 

environmental cleanup 

we are involved in the environmental investigation or remediation of numerous sites of these sites 

 our liability with respect to these various sites ranges from insignificant to substantial the amount of liability depends on 

 we spent approximately 10 million  in 2016  and expect to spend approximately 10 million in 2017  on environmental remediation of these sites 

it is our policy to accrue for environmentalremediation costs when we 

 we currently believe it is reasonably possible that our costs to remediate all the identified sites may exceed our current accruals of 34 million  the excess amounts required may be insignificant or could range in the aggregate up to 110 million  over several years this estimate of the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs is much less certain than the estimates we currently are using to determine how much to accrue the estimate of the upper range also uses assumptions less favorable to us among the range of reasonably possible outcomes 

regulation of air emissions in the us 

the united states environmental protection agency epa has promulgated regulations for air emissions from 

 these regulations cover 

 between 2011 and 2015 epa issued three related portions of new mact standards for industrial boilers and process heaters in july 2016 a court decision was issued that remains unsettled at this time but which will cause certain of the emissions standards to be reissued some of these reissued emissions standards will be applicable to a small number of our wood products mills because the court decision remains unsettled and because we do not know how or when the epa will implement the final court decision we cannot predict whether or when the emission standard revisions may have a material impact on regulatory compliance costs at our mills we do not expect any material expenditures in 2017 to comply with mact standards 

the epa must still promulgate supplemental mact standards for plywood lumber and composite wood products facilities the epa is expected to collect information for these future rulemakings in 2017 

we cannot currently quantify the amount of capital we will need in the future to comply with new regulations being developed by the epa because final rules have not been promulgated 

in 2010 epa issued a final greenhouse gas rule limiting the growth of emissions from new projects meeting certain thresholds on june 23 2014 the us supreme court issued a decision that removed potential applicability of the underlying 2010 regulations based solely on greenhouse gas emissions and limited application of the rule’s technology requirements to larger emission sources as a result of new emissions from nongreenhouse gas pollutants as a result of this supreme court ruling epa is expected to issue new regulations to set thresholds for when the greenhouse gas technology requirements apply if the nongreenhouse gas emissions trigger the rule in the first instance the impact of the supreme court ruling is to end the potential applicability of the technology requirements for our smaller manufacturing operations and limit the applicability for our other operations 

in 2015 epa issued an extensive regulatory program for new and existing electric utility generating units to scale back emissions of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide co2 arising from fossil fuel use to generate electricity epa also proposed additional regulations related to how states and federal agencies may implement the requirements finalized in 2015 this regulatory program potentially will have indirect impacts on our operations such as from rising purchased electricity prices or from mandated energy demand reductions that could apply to our mills and other facilities that we operate we are evaluating the regulations and additional proposals but are not able to predict whether the regulations when complete and implemented will have a material impact on our operations 

we use significant biomass for energy production at our mills epa is currently working on rules regarding regulation of biomass emissions 

the impact of these greenhouse gas and biomass rules as well as recent court decisions on our operations remains uncertain 

to address concerns about greenhouse gases as a pollutant we 



  weyerhaeuser company  2016 annual report and form 10k   21 

  

 additional factors that could affect greenhouse gas emissions in the future include 

 we believe these developments have not had and in 2017  will not have a significant effect on our operations although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations we maintain an active forestry research program to track and understand any potential effect from actual climate change related parameters that could affect the forests we own and manage and do not anticipate any disruptions to our planned operations 

regulation of air emissions in canada 

in addition to existing provincial air quality regulations the canadian federal government has proposed an air quality management system aqms as a comprehensive national approach for improving air quality in canada the federal proposed aqms includes 

 in 2016 environment canada released the pancanadian framework on clean growth and climate change a greenhouse gas emission framework the framework put in place a national sectorbased greenhouse gas reduction program applicable to a number of industries 

all canadian provincial governments 

 in addition british columbia has adopted a carbon tax and alberta has a mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction regulation 

we believe these measures have not had and in 2017  will not have a significant effect on our operations although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations we also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations 

regulation of air emissions in uruguay 

some provinces in uruguay have established air quality monitoring networks and ambient air objectives have been proposed for the region where our los piques mill is located 

we believe these measures have not had and in 2017  will not have a significant effect on our operations although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations we also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations  

regulation of water 

in the us as a result of litigation under the federal clean water act additional federal or state permits are now required in some states for the application of pesticides including herbicides on timberlands those permits have entailed payment of additional costs in addition there is continuing litigation in the federal courts that may result in permit requirements for pollution discharges from forest roads and other drainage features on timberland which would entail additional costs for forest landowners including weyerhaeuser finally federal regulatory agencies adopted rules in 2015 that potentially expand the definition of waters subject to federal clean water act jurisdiction which could increase the scope and number of permits required for forestryrelated activities and entail additional costs for weyerhaeuser and other forest landowners in the us those rules have been challenged in federal court by multiple parties and states and an injunction has been entered that prevents them from going into effect we are not able to predict the ultimate resolution of these pending legal actions 

in 2016 washington state department of ecology wa doe adopted human healthbased water quality criteria the epa subsequently promulgated its own water quality standards for washington state for the protection of human health for certain pollutants it is unclear what effect if any these rules will have on our manufacturing operations in washington state 

in 2016 the epa finalized new and revised federal clean water act water quality standards and human health criteria that would apply to waters under the state of maines jurisdiction 

in addition 



  weyerhaeuser company  2016 annual report and form 10k   22 

  

we believe the above developments have not had and in 2017  will not have a significant effect on our operations although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations we also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations 

potential changes in pollution regulation 

state governments continue to promulgate total maximum daily load tmdl requirements for pollutants in water bodies that do not meet state or epa water quality standards state tmdl requirements may 

 it is not possible to estimate the capital expenditures that may be required for us to meet pollution allocations across the various proposed state tmdl programs until a specific tmdl is promulgated 

in canada various levels of government have been working to address water issues including use quality and management recent areas of focus include water allocation regional watershed protection protection of drinking water water pricing and a national water quality index

risk factors 

we are subject to various risks and events that could adversely affect our business our financial condition our results of operations our cash flows and the price of our common stock 

you should consider the following risk factors in addition to the information presented elsewhere in this report particularly in  our business  who we are   our business  what we do   our business  natural resources and environmental matters  “ forwardlooking statements ” and  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as in the filings we make from time to time with the sec in evaluating us our business and an investment in our securities 

the risks discussed below are not the only risks we face additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely affect our business 



macroeconomic conditions 

the industries in which we operate are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions and consequently are highly cyclical 

the overall levels of demand for the products we manufacture and distribute reflect fluctuations in levels of enduser demand which consequently impact our sales and profitability enduser demand depends in part on general macroeconomic conditions both in the us and globally as well as on local economic conditions current economic conditions in the united states reflect growth at or below historical trends and general business uncertainty global economic conditions reflect issues such as inflation and slowing growth in emerging countries the construction and homebuilding industries continue to recover from the severe downturn caused by the overall collapse of credit markets and recession of 2009 however construction activity remains below prerecession and trend levels our wood products segment is highly dependent on the strength of the homebuilding industry the decline in home construction activity due to the recession resulted in depressed prices of and reduced demand for wood products and building materials this resulted in lower prices and demand for logs and reduced harvests in our timberlands segment the length and magnitude of industry cycles vary over time and by product but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions and levels of industry capacity those conditions have improved since the recession but if macroeconomic conditions do not continue to improve we could experience lower sales volume and smaller margins 

commodity products 

many of our products are commodities that are widely available from other producers 

because commodity products have few distinguishing properties from producer to producer competition for these products is based primarily on price which is determined by supply relative to demand and competition from substitute products in addition prices for our products are affected by many other factors outside of our control as a result we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes which often are volatile our profitability with respect to these products depends in part on managing our costs particularly raw material and energy costs which represent significant components of our operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control both sales and profitability of our products are subject to volatility due to market forces beyond our control 

industry supply of logs and wood products 

excess supply of logs and wood products may adversely affect prices and margins 

our industry may increase harvest levels which could lead to an oversupply of logs wood products producers may likewise expand manufacturing capacity which could lead to an oversupply of manufactured wood products any occurrence continuation or increase of industry oversupply to our markets could adversely affect our prices and margins 

homebuilding market and economic risks 

high unemployment low demand and low levels of consumer confidence can adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our business is dependent upon the health of the us housing market demand for homes is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as the level of employment consumer confidence consumer income the availability of financing and interest rate levels the legacy of the housing bubble its collapse and ensuing credit crisis was tightened credit requirements and a reduced number of mortgage loans available for financing home purchases although credit conditions have eased they remain more restrictive than prior to the housing bubble demand for new homes also has been adversely affected by factors such as limited wage growth and weak consumer confidence additionally rising student loan debt among younger adults is limiting access to mortgage financing and home ownership foreclosure rates and distress sales of houses have fallen significantly and are less of an impact compared to the years immediately following the housing collapse 

homebuyers’ ability to qualify for and obtain affordable mortgages could be affected by changes in interest rates government sponsored entities and private mortgage insurance companies supporting the mortgage market 

access to affordable mortgage financing is critical to the health of the us housing market recently the us federal reserve increased its benchmark interest rate and further increases are expected in 2017 generally increases in interest rates make mortgage financing more difficult for home buyers to obtain which could negatively affect demand for housing and in turn for our products 

another significant role of the federal government in supporting mortgage lending has been through its sponsorship of fannie mae and freddie mac as a result of turbulence in credit markets and the mortgage finance industry in the last few years the effect of the federal government ’ s conservatorship of these government sponsored entities on the shortterm and longterm demand for new housing remains unclear   the liquidity provided to the mortgage industry by fannie mae and freddie mac both of which purchase home mortgages and mortgagebacked securities originated by mortgage lenders has been critical to the housing market however there have been questions and concerns about the future purpose of fannie mae and freddie mac and a number of proposals to curtail their activities over time are under review limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these entities could also adversely affect interest rates and the availability of mortgage financing 

  weyerhaeuser company  2016 annual report and form 10k   25 

  

whether resulting from direct increases in borrowing rates or reduced federal support of the mortgage lending industry a challenging mortgage financing environment could reduce demand for housing and therefore adversely affect demand for our products 

changes in regulations relating to tax deductions for mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes could harm our future sales and earnings 

significant costs of homeownership include mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes both of which are generally deductible for an individual ’ s federal and in some cases state income taxes any changes to income tax laws by the federal government or a state government to eliminate or substantially reduce these income tax deductions as has been considered from time to time would increase the aftertax cost of owning a home increases in real estate taxes by local governmental authorities would also increase the cost of homeownership any such increases to the cost of homeownership could adversely affect the demand for our products 

capital markets 

deterioration in economic conditions and the credit markets could adversely affect our access to capital 

challenging financial or credit market conditions can impair the company ’ s ability to borrow money or otherwise access credit markets on terms acceptable to us which may among other impacts reduce our ability to take advantage of growth and expansion opportunities similarly our customers may be unable to borrow money to fund their operations similarly deteriorating or volatile market conditions could have an adverse effect on our customers and suppliers and their ability to purchase our products or sell products to us 

changes in credit ratings 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results and balance sheet actions that we take their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing the company on a watch list for possible future ratings actions downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading could limit our access to the credit markets increase our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

substitution 

some of our products are vulnerable to declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials 

our products may compete with nonfiber based alternatives or with alternative products in certain market segments for example plastic woodplastic or composite materials may be used by builders as alternatives to the products produced by our wood products businesses such as lumber veneer plywood and oriented strand board changes in prices for oil chemicals and woodbased fiber can change the competitive position of our products relative to available alternatives and could increase substitution of those products for our products if use of these alternative products grows demand for and pricing of our products could be adversely affected 

changes in product mix or pricing 

our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by changes in product mix or pricing 

our results may be adversely affected by a change in our product mix or pricing if we are not successful in implementing previously announced or future price increases or in our plans to increase sales of higherpriced highervalue products or if there are delays in acceptance of price increases or failure of customers to accept higherpriced products our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected price discounting if required to maintain our competitive position could result in lower than anticipated price realizations and margins 

intense competition 

we face intense competition in our markets and the failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we compete with north american producers and for some of our product lines global producers some of which may have greater financial resources and lower production costs than we do the principal basis for competition for many of our products is selling price our ability to maintain satisfactory margins depends in large part on our ability to control our costs our industries also are particularly sensitive to other factors including innovation design quality and service with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line to the extent that one or more of our competitors become more successful with respect to any key competitive factor our ability to attract and retain customers could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to compete effectively such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

expiration of the softwood lumber agreement creates uncertainty about competition from canadian imports  

historically canada has been a significant source of lumber for the us market particularly in the new home construction market we produce lumber in our canadian mills but the bulk of our production is in the us the softwood lumber agreement sla between canada and the us originally signed in october 2006 expired in october 2015 the 2006 sla required canadian softwood lumber facilities including our mills to pay an export tax when the price of lumber is at or below a threshold price we are not able to predict when or if a new agreement will be reached or if reached what the terms of the agreement would be we could experience downward pressure on timber and lumber prices caused by canadian lumber imports 

another emerging form of competition is between brands of sustainably produced products customer demand for certain brands could reduce competition among buyers for our products or cause other adverse effects 

in north america our forests are third partycertified to the sustainable forestry initiative sfi ®  standard some of our customers have expressed a preference in certain of our product lines for products made from raw materials sourced from forests certified to different standards including standards of the forest stewardship council fsc if and to the extent that preference for a standard other than sfi ® becomes a 

  weyerhaeuser company  2016 annual report and form 10k   26 

  

customer requirement there may be reduced demand and lower prices for our products relative to competitors who can supply products sourced from forests certified to competing certification standards if we seek to comply with such other standards we could incur materially increased costs for our operations or be required to modify our operations such as reducing harvest levels fsc in particular employs standards that are geographically variable and could cause a material reduction in the harvest levels of some of our timberlands most notably in the pacific northwest 

material disruption of manufacturing 

a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales or negatively affect our results of operation and financial condition 

any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

 any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products or require us to make unplanned capital expenditures if one of our facilities or machines were to incur significant downtime our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired resulting in lower sales and income although some risks are not insurable and some coverage is limited we purchase insurance protecting our manufacturing facilities from fires floods windstorms earthquakes equipment failures and boiler explosions 

strategic initiatives 

our business and financial results may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully execute on important strategic initiatives   

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results these strategic initiatives are designed to improve our results of operations and drive longterm shareholder value and include among others optimizing cash flow through operational excellence reducing costs to achieve industryleading cost structure and innovating in highermargin products  

we may be unsuccessful in carrying out our acquisition strategy 

we intend to strategically pursue acquisitions of timberland properties when market conditions warrant as with any investment our acquisitions may not perform in accordance with our expectations in addition we anticipate financing such acquisitions through cash from operations borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities proceeds from equity or debt offerings or proceeds from asset dispositions or any combination thereof our inability to finance future acquisitions on favorable terms could adversely affect our results of operations 

strategic review of our uruguay operations 

on october 12 2016 we announced that our board of directors authorized the exploration of strategic alternatives for our uruguay timberlands and manufacturing businesses including options to continue to hold and operate or sell the business if a sale is pursued there can be no assurance that an agreement with a thirdparty purchaser for the business will be reached and if any such an agreement is reached there can be no assurance that it will be on terms favorable to us or that the transactions contemplated by such an agreement will be consummated 

capital requirements 

our operations require substantial capital 

our businesses require substantial capital for expansion and for repair or replacement of existing facilities or equipment although we maintain our production equipment with regular scheduled maintenance key pieces of equipment may need to be repaired or replaced periodically the costs of repairing or replacing such equipment and the associated downtime of the affected production line could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

while we believe our capital resources will be adequate to meet our current projected operating needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements if for any reason we are unable to provide for our operating needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements on acceptable economic terms we could experience a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

environmental laws and regulations 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with violations of or liabilities under applicable environmental laws and other laws and regulations 

we are subject to a wide range of general and industryspecific laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing 

  weyerhaeuser company  2016 annual report and form 10k   27 

  

 we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations and as a result of remedial obligations we also could incur substantial costs such as civil or criminal fines sanctions and enforcement actions including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions cleanup and closure costs and thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations 

as the owner and operator of real estate we may be liable under environmental laws for cleanup closure and other damages resulting from the presence and release of hazardous substances on or from our properties or operations in addition surface water management regulations may present liabilities and are subject to change the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict and in some cases our liability may exceed forecasted amounts or the value of the property itself the discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at our sites or thirdparty sites may result in significant additional costs 

we also lease some of our properties to thirdparty operators for the purpose of exploring extracting developing and producing oil gas rock and other minerals in exchange for fees and royalty payments these activities are also subject to federal state and local laws and regulations these operations may create risk of environmental liabilities for any unlawful discharge of oil gas or other chemicals into the air soil or water generally these thirdparty operators indemnify us against any such liability and we require that that they maintain liability insurance during the term of our lease with them however if for any reason our thirdparty operators are not able to honor their indemnity obligation or if the required liability insurance were not in effect then it is possible that we could be responsible for costs associated with   environmental liability caused by such thirdparty operators 

any material liability we incur as a result of activities conducted on our properties by us or by others with whom we have a business relationship could adversely affect our financial condition or preclude us from making capital expenditures that otherwise would benefit our business 

we also anticipate public policy developments at the state federal and international level regarding climate change and energy access security and competitiveness we expect these developments to address emission of carbon dioxide renewable energy and fuel standards and the monetization of carbon compliance with regulations that implement new public policy in these areas might require significant expenditures these developments may also include mandated changes to energy use and building codes which could affect our homebuilding practices enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretation of these laws or regulations might require significant expenditures we also anticipate public policy developments at the state federal and international level regarding taxes and a number of other areas that could require significant expenditures 

changes in global or regional climate conditions and governmental response to such changes at the international us federal and state levels may affect our operations or our planned or future growth activities 

there continue to be numerous international us federal and statelevel initiatives and proposals to address domestic and global climate issues within the us and canada some of these proposals would and have in some canadian provinces regulate andor tax the production of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to facilitate the reduction of carbon compound emissions into the atmosphere and provide tax and other incentives to produce and use cleaner energy climate change impacts if they occur and governmental initiatives laws and regulations to address potential climate concerns could increase our costs and have a longterm adverse impact on our businesses and results of operations future legislation or regulatory activity in this area remains uncertain and its impact on our operations is unclear at this time however it is possible that legislation or government mandates standards or regulations intended to mitigate or reduce carbon compound or greenhouse gas emissions or other climate change impacts could adversely affect our operations for example such activities could limit harvest levels or result in significantly higher costs for energy and other raw materials because our manufacturing operations depend upon significant amounts of energy and raw materials these initiatives could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and profitability 

currency exchange rates 

we will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates 

we have manufacturing operations in canada and uruguay we are also an exporter and compete with global producers of products very similar to ours therefore we are affected by changes in the strength of the us dollar particularly relative to the canadian dollar euro and yen and the strength of the euro relative to the yen changes in exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our sales volume margins and results of operations 

availability of raw materials and energy 

our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials and energy 

we rely heavily on certain raw materials principally wood fiber and chemicals and energy sources principally natural gas electricity and fuel oil in our manufacturing processes our ability to increase earnings has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials and energy sources we may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material or energy costs through hedging arrangements price increases productivity improvements or costreduction programs

people 

our business is dependent upon attracting retaining and developing key personnel 

we believe that our success depends to a significant extent upon our ability to attract retain and develop key senior management and operations management personnel our failure to recruit retain and develop key personnel could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

transportation 

we depend on third parties for transportation services and increases in costs and disruptions in the availability of transportation could materially adversely affect our business and operations 

our business depends on the transportation of a large number of products both domestically and internationally we rely primarily on third parties for transportation of the products we manufacture or distribute as well as delivery of our raw materials a significant portion of the goods we manufacture and raw materials we use are transported by marine rail and truck each of which is highly regulated in addition each has historically been subject to periodic disruption due to labor issues 

if any of our thirdparty transportation providers were to fail to deliver the goods we manufacture or distribute in a timely manner we may be unable to sell those products at full value or at all similarly if any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner we may be unable to manufacture our products in response to customer demand in addition if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us we may be unable to replace them at reasonable cost our thirdparty transportation providers are also subject to events outside of their control such as disruption of transportation infrastructure due to labor issues or natural disasters 

any failure of a thirdparty transportation provider to deliver raw materials or finished products in a timely manner could harm our reputation negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition an increase in transportation rates or fuel surcharges could materially adversely affect our sales and profitability 

reit status and tax implications 

if we fail to remain qualified as a reit our taxable income would be subject to tax at corporate rates and we would not be able to deduct dividends to shareholders 

in any taxable year in which we fail to qualify as a reit unless we are entitled to relief under the internal revenue code 

 qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code to our operations and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions although we operate in a manner consistent with the reit qualification rules we cannot assure you that we are or will remain so qualified 

certain of our business activities are subject to corporatelevel income tax and potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax 

under the internal revenue code reits generally must engage in the ownership and management of income producing real estate for the 

company this generally includes owning and managing a timberland portfolio for the production and sale of standing timber accordingly the harvesting and sale of logs the development or sale of certain timberlands and other real estate and the manufacture and sale of wood products are conducted through one or more of our whollyowned taxable reit subsidiaries trss because such activities could generate nonqualifying reit income and could constitute “prohibited transactions” prohibited transactions are defined by the internal revenue code generally to be sales or other dispositions of property to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business by conducting our business in this manner we believe that we satisfy the reit requirements of the internal revenue code and are not subject to the 100 percent tax that could be imposed if a reit were to conduct a prohibited transaction the net income of our trss is subject to corporatelevel income tax 

the extent of our use of our trss may affect the price of our common shares relative to the share price of other reits 

we conduct a significant portion of our business activities through one or more trss the use of our trss enables us to engage in nonreit qualifying business activities such as the sale of logs production and sale of wood products and the development and sale of certain higher and better use hbu property our trss are subject to corporatelevel income tax under the code no more than 25 percent 20 percent after december 31 2017 of the value of the gross assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss this limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our trss’ operations furthermore our use of trss may cause the market to value our common shares differently than the shares of other reits which may not use trss as extensively as we use them 

we may be limited in our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our trss 

the ability of the reit to receive dividends from our trss is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a reit in particular at least 75 percent of gross income for each taxable year as a reit must be derived from real estate sources including sales of our standing timber and other types of qualifying real estate income and no more than 25 percent of our gross income may consist of dividends from our trss and other nonreal estate income 

this limitation on our ability to receive dividends from our trss may affect our ability to fund cash distributions to our shareholders using cash flows from our trss the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed and trs income that is not distributed to the reit will not be subject to the reit income distribution requirement 

our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate 

generally reits are required to distribute 90 percent of their ordinary taxable income and 95 percent of their net capital gains income capital gains may be retained by the reit but would be subject to corporate income taxes if capital gains are retained rather than distributed our shareholders would be notified and they would be deemed to have received a taxable distribution with a refundable credit for any federal income tax paid by the reit accordingly we believe that we are not required to distribute material amounts of cash since substantially all of our taxable income is treated as capital gains income our board of directors in its sole discretion determines the amount of quarterly dividends to be 

  weyerhaeuser company  2016 annual report and form 10k   29 

  

provided to our shareholders based on consideration of a number of factors these factors include but are not limited to our results of operations cash flow and capital requirements economic conditions tax considerations borrowing capacity and other factors including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments future acquisitions and divestitures harvest levels changes in the price and demand for our products and general market demand for timberlands including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses consequently our dividend levels may fluctuate 

changes in tax laws or their interpretation could adversely affect our shareholders and our results of operations 

federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process the internal revenue service the united states department of the treasury and state taxing authorities changes to tax laws could adversely affect our shareholders or increase our effective tax rates we cannot predict with certainty whether when in what forms or with what effective dates the tax laws applicable to us or our shareholders may be changed

legal proceedings 

see note 14 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies   and note 19 income taxes   in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for a summary of legal proceedings 




 

legal proceedings 

we are a party to a number of legal proceedings and adverse judgments in certain legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

the costs and other effects of pending litigation and legal proceedings against us and if any related insurance recoveries cannot be determined with certainty although the disclosures in note 14 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies  and note 19 income taxes  of notes to consolidated financial statements  contain management ’ s current views of the effect such litigation and legal proceedings could have on our financial results there can be no assurance that the outcome of such proceedings will be as expected 

it is possible that there could be adverse judgments against us in some or all major litigation against us and that we could be required to take a charge and make cash payments for all or a portion of any damage award any such charge or cash payment could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows for the quarter or year in which we record or pay it 

importexport taxes and duties 

we may be required to pay significant taxes on our exported products or countervailing and antidumping duties on our imported products 

we export logs and finished wood products to foreign markets and our ability to do so profitably is affected by us and foreign trade policy international trade disputes occur frequently and can be taken to an international trade court for resolution of unfair trade practices between countries as an example there have been many disputes and subsequent trade agreements regarding sales of softwood lumber between canada and the united states the softwood lumber agreement sla between canada and the us originally signed in october 2006 expired in october 2015 and a new agreement has not been reached the sla required canadian softwood lumber facilities including our mills to pay an export tax when the price of lumber is at or below a threshold price which could be as high as 225 percent if a province exceeds its total allotted export share as well as potentially impose additional countervailing antidumping duties additionally the new us administration might adopt international trade policy that could result in one or more of our foreign export market jurisdictions adopting responsive trade policy making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products in those countries 

we could therefore experience reduced revenues and margins in any of our businesses that is adversely affected by international trade  tariffs  duties taxes customs or dispute settlement terms  to the extent such trade policies increase prices they could also reduce the demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial results and financial condition including facility closures or impairments of assets we cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any settlements of international trade disputes and their impact on our business 

distribution of wreco shares 

we could incur substantial us federal tax liability if the wreco transaction were found not to qualify as a taxfree “reorganization” or the distribution of wreco shares to weyerhaeuser shareholders were found not to qualify as a taxfree distribution 

in 2014 we closed the divestiture of our home building business weyerhaeuser real estate company wreco via a reverse morris trust transaction pursuant to which a wholly  owned subsidiary of tri pointe homes inc tri pointe merged with and into wreco with wreco surviving the merger and becoming a wholly  owned subsidiary of tri pointe the reverse morris trust transaction was structured to qualify as a taxfree reorganization and the associated distribution of wreco shares to weyerhaeuser shareholders as a taxfree distribution if the transaction were determined not to qualify as a taxfree reorganization   or if the distribution does not qualify as a taxfree distribution then weyerhaeuser or its subsidiaries or weyerhaeuser shareholders may be required to pay substantial us federal income taxes 

if the transaction were determined not to qualify as a taxfree reorganization or the distribution not to qualify as a taxfree distribution or if weyerhaeuser were required to indemnify tri pointe and wreco such taxes and indemnification obligations could be substantial and could materially and adversely affect the company’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

our merger with plum creek timber company inc 

the merger with plum creek involved substantial costs and the combined company may be unable to successfully integrate the businesses of the two companies and realize the anticipated benefits of the merger  

on february 19 2016 plum creek timber company inc merged with and into weyerhaeuser company with weyerhaeuser continuing as the surviving company we have incurred substantial costs and expenses and expect to incur additional costs and expenses relating to the integration of the businesses policies procedures operations employees technologies and systems of plum creek with those of weyerhaeuser these expenses could particularly in the near term exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from the realization of economies of scale and cost savings and synergies related to the integration of the businesses and could therefore result in additional charges against earnings but the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain 

the merger involved the combination of two independently operated public companies and will require management to devote significant attention and resources to integrating business practices and operations the combined company may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the merger if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected 

  weyerhaeuser company  2016 annual report and form 10k   30 

  

we are dependent on the valuable experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other employees to execute our business plans and successfully conduct operations our success after the merger will depend in part upon our ability to retain key personnel current and prospective employees may feel uncertain about their roles following the merger which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel  

the market price of our common stock may decline in the future as a result of the merger  

the market price of our common stock may decline in the future as a result of the merger for a number of reasons including our inability to successfully integrate the two companies or our failure to achieve the perceived benefits of the merger including financial results as rapidly as or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts failure to successfully integrate the two companies could negatively impact our revenues earnings and cash flows and could materially adversely affect our ability to pay dividends at historical levels or at all 

the combined company may incur adverse tax consequences if either weyerhaeuser or plum creek has failed or fails to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes  

each of weyerhaeuser and plum creek has operated in a manner that it believes has allowed it to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes under the code see “reit status and tax implications” above for a description of the reit requirements and consequences of failing to maintain reit status we intend to operate in a manner that allows us to continue to qualify as a reit after the merger however even if we have operated so as to retain our reit status if plum creek were to lose its reit status for a taxable year before the merger or that includes the merger we will face serious tax consequences that could substantially reduce cash available for distribution to our shareholders and significantly impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital if the merger were determined not to qualify as a taxfree merger we could incur substantial federal tax liability that could materially and adversely affect the companys cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

timberland specific risks 

our ability to harvest and deliver timber may be subject to limitations which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our primary assets are our timberlands weather conditions timber growth cycles access limitations and availability of contract loggers and haulers may restrict our ability to harvest our timberlands other factors that may restrict our timber harvest include damage to our standing timber by fire or by insect infestation disease prolonged drought flooding severe weather and other natural disasters changes in global climate conditions could intensify one or more of these factors although damage from such causes usually is localized and affects only a limited percentage of standing timber there can be no assurance that any damage affecting our timberlands will in fact be limited as is common in the forest products industry we do not maintain insurance coverage for damage to our timberlands our revenues net income and cash flow from operations are dependent to a significant extent on the pricing of our products and our continued ability to harvest timber at adequate levels therefore if we were to be restricted from harvesting on a significant portion of our timberlands for a prolonged period of time or if material damage to a significant portion of our standing timber were to occur we could suffer a materially adverse impact to our results of operations 

on a shortterm basis we may adjust our timber harvest levels in response to market conditions longer term our timber harvest levels may be affected by acquisitions of additional timberlands sales of existing timberlands and shifts in harvest from one region to another in addition to timberland acquisitions and sales future timber harvest levels may be affected by changes in estimates of longterm sustainable yield because of silvicultural advances natural disasters fires pests insects and other hazards regulatory constraints and other factors beyond our control 

timber harvest activities are also subject to a number of federal state and local regulations pertaining to the protection of fish wildlife water and other resources regulations reinterpretations and litigation can restrict timber harvest activities and increase costs examples are federal and state laws protecting threatened endangered and “atrisk” species harvesting and forestry road building activities that may be restricted under the us federal clean water act state forestry practices laws laws protecting aboriginal rights and other similar regulations 

our estimates of timber inventories and growth rates may be inaccurate include risks inherent to such estimates and may impair our ability to realize expected revenues 

we rely upon estimates of merchantable timber inventories which include judgments regarding inventories that may be lawfully and economically harvested timber growth rates and endproduct yields when acquiring and managing working forests these estimates which are inherently inexact and uncertain in nature are central to forecasting our anticipated timber harvests revenues and expected cash flows timber growth rates and yield estimates are developed by forest biometricians and other experts using statistical measurements of a sample of trees on a given property timber growth equations are used that predict the rate of height and diameter growth of trees so that foresters can estimate the volume of timber that may be present in the tree stand at a given age tree growth varies by soil type geographic area and climate inappropriate application of growth equations in forest management planning may lead to inaccurate estimates of future volumes if these estimates are inaccurate our ability to manage our timberlands in a sustainable or profitable manner may be diminished which may cause our results of operations and our stock price to be adversely affected 

our operating results and cash flows will be materially affected by supply and demand for timber 

a variety of factors affect prices for timber including available supply changes in economic conditions that impact demand the level of domestic new construction and remodeling activity interest rates credit availability population growth weather conditions and pest infestation and other factors these factors vary by region timber type sawlogs or pulpwood logs and species 

timber prices are affected by changes in demand on a local national or international level the closure of a mill in the regions where we own timber can have a material adverse effect on demand and therefore pricing as the demand for paper continues to decline closures of pulp mills have adversely affected the demand for pulpwood and wood chips in certain regions in which we operate we export logs to asia while demand for asia has remained steady recently asian markets have experienced a high degree of volatility especially in china a decrease in demand of logs from asia may have a negative impact on log and lumber in the markets in which we compete 

timber prices are affected by changes in timber availability at the local national and international level our timberland ownership is concentrated in alabama arkansas louisiana mississippi north carolina oklahoma oregon and washington in some of these states much of the timberland is privately owned increases in timber prices often result in substantial increases in harvesting on private timberlands including lands not previously made available for commercial timber operations causing a shortterm increase in supply that moderates price increases in western states such as oregon and washington where a greater proportion of timberland is government owned any substantial 

  weyerhaeuser company  2016 annual report and form 10k   31 

  

increase in timber harvesting from governmentowned land could significantly reduce timber prices on a local level timber supplies can fluctuate depending upon factors such as changes in weather conditions and harvest strategies of local timberland owners as well as occasionally high timber salvage efforts due to events such as unusual pest infestations or fires 

timberlands make up a significant portion of our business portfolio 

our real estate holdings are primarily timberlands and we may make additional timberlands acquisitions in the future as the owner and manager of approximately 131 million  acres of timberlands we are subject to the risks that are inherent in concentrated real estate investments a downturn in the real estate industry generally or the timber or forest products industries specifically could reduce the value of our properties and adversely affect our results of operations such a downturn could also adversely affect our customers and reduce the demand for our products as well as our ability to realize upon our strategy of selling nonstrategic timberlands and timberland properties that have higher and better uses at attractive prices these risks may be more pronounced than if we diversified our investments outside real estate or outside timberlands 

cybersecurity risks 

we rely on information technology to support our operations and reporting environments a security failure of that technology could impact our ability to operate our businesses effectively adversely affect our reported financial results impact our reputation and expose us to potential liability or litigation 

we use information systems to carry out our operational activities and maintain our business records some systems are internally managed and some are maintained by thirdparty service providers we and our service providers employ what we believe are adequate security measures our ability to conduct business could be materially and adversely affected if these systems or resources are compromised damaged or fail this could be a result of a cyber incident natural disaster hardware or software corruption failure or error telecommunications system failure service provider error or failure intentional or unintentional personnel actions or other disruption 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property other proprietary information and personally identifiable information if this data is compromised destroyed or inappropriately disclosed it could have a material adverse effect including damage to our reputation loss of customers significant expenses to address and resolve the issues or litigation or other proceedings by affected individuals business partners andor regulators 



stockprice volatility 

the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors some of which are beyond our control 

the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors some of which are beyond our control including those described above under  risks related to our industries and business  and the following 

 in addition there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in the forest products industry that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 

some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them if litigation of this type is brought against us it could result in substantial costs and divert management ’ s attention and resources

our mda includes the following major sections 

 



the strength of the us housing market strongly affects our wood products timberlands and real estate segments as published by the us census bureau total us housing starts for 2016 were 1166000 units with singlefamily units accounting for 781000 of the total this represents an almost 10 percent increase in singlefamily starts from 2015 which were 715000 units multifamily construction was slightly weaker in 2016 falling to 385000 units compared with 396000 in 2015 expectations are for a 6 percent to 12 percent increase in total starts in 2017 consensus forecasts place expected total housing starts between 124 and 131 million units for 2017 sources include nahb fannie mae mortgage bankers association apa and fea demand for homes remains strong relative to inventories us census reported new homes sales of 563 thousand units a 122 percent rise in sales over 2015 and consistently low inventories as measured by months of supply which averaged 53 months through 2016 existing homes performed similarly with total sales for 2016 of 545 million units a gain of 4 percent over 2015 and the highest sales level since 2006 according to the national association of realtors existing home inventories were also tight with supplies averaging 43 months for the year while housing has improved significantly since the recession of 2009 current demand for new housing continues to run below historic levels the joint center for housing studies at harvard projects trend demand at 17 million total units which is well above current levels remodeling activity also affects our wood products and timberlands segments according to the joint center for housing studies at harvard the leading indicator of remodeling activity lira increased 6 percent in 2016 and is expected to rise 78 percent in 2017 

real estate sales are affected by local economic conditions the ability of borrowers to obtain financing the number of competing properties listed for sale and the availability of government and not for profit funding especially for conservation sales 

wood products primarily sells into the new residential building and repair and remodel markets demand for wood products continued to improve in 2016 following the growth in home construction and remodeling the random lengths framing lumber composite was 4 percent higher in 2016 versus 2015 while oriented strand board osb was 29 percent higher in 2016 versus 2015 as measured by random lengths north central price expectations are for similar to slightly higher wood product prices in 2017 as demand continues to increase with growth in housing starts and remodeling 

demand for logs from our timberlands segment is affected by the production of woodbased building products as well as export demand in our western holdings in the south southern pine sawlog prices as reported by timbermartsouth were 2 percent lower in 2016 compared with 2015 as available supplies continue to match or exceed growth in demand western domestic log prices as reported by loglines were flat in 2016 while export logs to japan were 1 percent higher however exports of hemlock logs whose primary destinations are china and korea sold at prices 8 percent below 2015 levels expectations are for slightly improved log prices as offshore demand improves over 2016 and domestic wood products manufacturing output increases with rising housing starts creating increased log demand 

energy markets hit their low point in early 2016 and rebounded through the remainder of the year for the year oil prices averaged 43bbl for west texas intermediate crude an 11 percent decline from 2015 prices bottomed in february at 30bbl recovering to almost 52bbl in december natural gas prices were also lower in 2016 but the decline from 2015 was more modest at 4 percent for the henry hub price expectations are for energy prices to slowly increase in 2017

in reviewing our results of operations it is important to understand these terms 

 our merger with plum creek during first quarter 2016 significantly affected the comparability of our consolidated operating results between 2016 and prior periods as a result of progress made to integrate financial processes and systems since the merger date the results beginning on february 19 2016 from acquired plum creek operations and the respective impacts of these results on our current period results are impracticable to disclose in the yeartodate period ended december 31 2016 our prior period results do not include premerger results of plum creek operations 

when compared to historical plum creek results the postmerger results of the acquired operations are significantly affected by the following items

 net earnings attributable to weyerhaeuser common shareholders 

our net earnings attributable to weyerhaeuser common shareholders increased 543 million  — 118 percent — compared to 2015 earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 151 million — 43 percent — due to the variances in net sales costs of products sold and operating income explained above the increase was offset by a 147 million increase to income taxes from continuing operations resulting from increased taxable earnings generated by our trss

timberlands 

how we did in 2016 

we report sales volume and annual production data for our timberlands segment in our businesswhat we dotimberlands  

here is a comparison of net sales to unaffiliated customers intersegment sales cost of products sold and net contribution to earnings for the last three years 

net sales and net contribution to earnings for timberlands   

comparing 2016  with 2015 

compared to 2015 the changes to the results of operations for our timberlands segment are primarily attributable to the addition of approximately 63 million acres of plum creek timberlands which produced over 18 million tons of harvest volume in 2015 the merger results in expansion of our southern timberlands from 40 million acres to 74 million acres — an 85 percent increase — and our western timberlands from 26 to 30 million acres — a 15 percent increase the merger also added 25 million acres across maine michigan montana new hampshire vermont west virginia and wisconsin which we refer to collectively as our northern timberlands increases to sales volume are primarily attributable to the significant increases in the overall size of and harvests from our timberlands holdings by region particularly in the south and north regions 

the composition of our sales volume by region was also altered by the merger as the south and north regions which have lower average sales realizations compared to the west now comprise a greater portion of our overall sales additionally within the south the acquired timberlands alter the overall sales mix as lower realization pulpwood sales have increased and higher realization grade logs have decreased as a percentage of total sales volume resulting in lower average sales realizations overall for the region compared with 2015 

as a result of applying acquisition accounting to timber and timberland assets acquired as described in note 4 merger with plum creek  in notes to consolidated financial statements  depletion rates have increased significantly in 2016 compared to 2015 when combined with increased sales volume these higher depletion rates drive the significant increases in our costs of products sold in 2016 compared to 2015 for the periods presented

here is a comparison of net sales cost of products sold and net contribution to earnings for the last three years 

net sales and net contribution to earnings for real estate energy and natural resources 



the timing of real estate sales is a function of many factors including the general state of the economy demand in local real estate markets the ability to obtain entitlements the ability of buyers to obtain financing the number of competing properties listed for sale the seasonal nature of sales particularly in the northern states the plans of adjacent landowners our expectations of future price appreciation the timing of harvesting activities and the availability of government and notforprofit funding especially for conservation sales in any period the average sales price per acre will vary based on the location and physical characteristics of parcels sold 

comparing 2016  with 2015   

land acquired as a result of our merger with plum creek generally carries a higher per acre cost basis compared to our other acreage as a result of measuring acquired land at fair value via acquisition accounting as of the february 19 2016 merger date as a result our costs of timberlands will vary periodtoperiod based on the sales mix between acquired plum creek acreage and acreage owned by weyerhaeuser prior to the merger

net contribution to earnings decreased 24 million  — 30 percent — primarily attributable to increased general and administrative expenses of 20 million the increase in general and administrative expenses is the result of creating a standalone business segment separate from timberlands and dedicating more staff to the expanded land and natural resource footprint 

comparing 2015  with 2014 

net sales 

net sales decreased 3 million  — 3 percent  — attributable to decreased net energy and natural resources sales — 6 million  — primarily due to decreased oil and gas prices 

this decrease was partially offset by increased net real estate sales — 3 million  attributable to increases in volume of timberlands acres sold and an increase in average price realized per acre

critical accounting policies 

our critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and estimates they also have a high degree of complexity 

in accounting we base our judgments and estimates on 

 actual results however may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded 

our most critical accounting policies relate to our 

 details about our other significant accounting policies — what we use and how we estimate — are in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

pension and postretirement benefit plans   

we sponsor several pension and postretirement benefit plans for our employees key assumptions we use in accounting for the plans include our 

 at the end of every year we review our assumptions with external advisers and make adjustments as appropriate actual experience that differs from our assumptions or any changes in our assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

other factors that affect our accounting for the plans include 

 this section provides more information about our 

 expected longterm rate of return on plan assets 

plan assets are assets of the pension plan trusts that fund the benefits provided under the pension plans the expected longterm rate of return is our estimate of the longterm rate of return that our plan assets will earn our expected longterm rate of return is important in determining the net periodic benefit or cost we recognize for our plans 

over the 32 years  it has been in place our us pension trust investment strategy has achieved a 138 percent  net compound annual return rate 

after considering available information at the end of 2016  we have determined that we will reduce our assumption of longterm rate of return on plan assets used in determining net periodic benefit cost from 9 percent for the year ended december 31 2016 to 8 percent for the year ended december 31 2017 

factors we considered include 

 our expected longterm rate of return is important in determining the net periodic benefit or cost we recognize for our plans every 50 basis point decrease in our expected longterm rate of return would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately 

 the actual return on plan assets in any given year may vary from our expected longterm rate of return actual returns on plan assets affect the funded status of the plans differences between actual returns on plan assets and the expected longterm rate of return are reflected as adjustments to cumulative other comprehensive income loss a component of total equity 

discount rates 

our discount rates as of december 31 2016  are 



  weyerhaeuser company  2016 annual report and form 10k   52 

  

 we review our discount rates annually and revise them as needed the discount rates are selected at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of highquality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits 

pension and postretirement benefit expenses for 2017  will be based on the 43 percent  and 37 percent  assumed discount rates for us plans and 37 percent  and 36 percent  assumed discount rates for the canadian plans 

our discount rates are important in determining the cost of our plans a 50 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately 

 longlived assets 

we review the carrying value of our longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations the carrying value is the amount assigned to longlived assets in our financial statements 

an impairment occurs when the carrying value of longlived assets will not be recovered from future cash flows and is more than fair market value fair market value is the estimated amount we would receive if we were to sell the assets 

in determining fair market value and whether impairment has occurred we are required to estimate 

 key assumptions we use in developing the estimates include 

 contingent liabilities 

we are subject to lawsuits investigations and other claims related to environmental product and other matters and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 

we record contingent liabilities when 

 assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors including 

 in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that an ultimate loss may occur 

while we do our best in developing our projections recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain if estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges in other income expense net these exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flow in any given quarter or year see note 14 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for more information 

timber depletion 

we record depletion the costs attributed to timber harvested as trees are harvested 

to calculate our depletion rates which are updated annually we 

 

estimating the volume of timber available for harvest over the harvest cycle requires consideration of the following factors 

 

in addition the duration of the harvest cycle varies by geographic region and species of timber

depletion rate calculations do not include estimates for 

 

a 5 percent decrease in our estimate of future harvest volumes would have 

 business combinations 

we recognize identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair value goodwill if any as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed while we use our best estimates and assumptions for the purchase price allocation process to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to any goodwill previously recorded or to earnings in the event that no goodwill was previously recorded to the extent that we identify adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation beginning january 1 2016 we have adopted asu 201516 which eliminates the requirements to retrospectively apply measurement period adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation and revise comparative information on the income statement and balance sheet for any prior periods affected we will recognize measurement period adjustments and any resulting effect on earnings during the period in which the adjustment is identified upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statement of operations 

prospective accounting pronouncements 

a summary of prospective accounting pronouncements is in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  



we use adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation depletion and amortization adjusted ebitda as a key performance measure to evaluate the performance of the consolidated company and our business segments this measure should not be considered in isolation from and is not intended to represent an alternative to our results reported in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap however we believe adjusted ebitda provides meaningful supplemental information for our investors about our operating performance better facilitates period to period comparisons and is widely used by analysts lenders rating agencies and other interested parties our definition of adjusted ebitda may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to organizational changes and our february 19 2016 merger with plum creek effective for 2016 we have revised our definition of adjusted ebitda to add back the basis of real estate sold we have revised our priorperiod presentation to conform to our current reporting adjusted ebitda as we define it is operating income from continuing operations adjusted for depreciation depletion amortization basis of real estate sold pension and postretirement costs not allocated to business segments primarily interest cost expected return on plan assets amortization of actuarial loss and amortization of prior service costcredit and special items adjusted ebitda excludes results from joint ventures

effect of market conditions 

the health of the us housing market strongly affects our wood products and timberlands segments wood products primarily sells into the new residential building and repair and remodel markets demand for logs from our timberlands segment is affected by the production of woodbased building products as well as export demand cellulose fibers is primarily affected by global demand and the relative strength of the us dollar 

competition in our markets 

we operate in highly competitive domestic and foreign markets with numerous companies selling similar products many of our products also face competition from substitutes for wood and woodfiber products we compete in our markets primarily through price product quality and service levels we are relentlessly focused on improving operational excellence to ensure a competitive cost structure and producing quality products customers want and are wiling to pay for 

our business segments’ competitive strategies are as follows 

 

sales outside the us 

in 2015  23 billion  — 32 percent  — of our total consolidated sales from continuing operations were to customers outside the us our sales outside the us are generally denominated in us dollars the table below shows sales outside the us for the last three years 



our employees

 of these employees approximately 3500  are members of unions covered by multiyear collectivebargaining agreements more information about these agreements is in note 9 pension and other postretirement benefit plans   in the notes to consolidated financial statements  



this section provides information about how we 

 for each of our business segments we provide details about what we do where we do it how much we sell and where we are headed 

timberlands 

our timberlands segment manages 69 million  acres of private commercial timberlands worldwide we own 63 million  of those acres and have longterm leases on the other 06 million  acres in addition we have renewable longterm licenses on canadian timberlands the tables presented in this section include data from this segments business units as of the end of 2015  

what we do 

forestry management 

our timberlands segment 

 our goal is to maximize returns by selling logs and stumpage to internal and external customers we focus on solid wood and use intensive silviculture to improve forest productivity and returns while managing our forests on a sustainable basis to meet customer and public expectations 

  weyerhaeuser company  2015 annual report and form 10k   2 

sustainable forestry practices 

we are committed to responsible environmental stewardship wherever we operate managing forests to produce financially mature timber while protecting the ecosystem services they provide our working forests include places with unique environmental cultural historical or recreational value to protect their unique qualities we follow regulatory requirements voluntary standards and implement the sustainable forestry initiative ®  sfi standard independent auditing of all of the forests we own or manage in the united states and canada certifies that we meet the sfi standard our timberlands in uruguay are certified under the forest stewardship council fsc standard or the uruguayan national forestry management standard which is endorsed by the program for the endorsement of forest certification pefc 

canadian forestry operations 

in canada we manage timberlands under longterm licenses that provide raw material for our manufacturing facilities in various provinces when we harvest trees we pay the provinces at stumpage rates set by the government which generally are based on prevailing market prices we transfer logs to our manufacturing facilities at cost and do not generate any profit in the timberlands segment from the harvest of timber from the licensed acres in canada 

other values from our timberlands 

in the united states we actively manage mineral oil and gas leases on our land and use geologic databases to identify and market opportunities for commercial mineral and geothermal development we recognize leasing bonus and option revenue over the terms of agreements with customers revenue primarily comes from 

 in managing mineral resources we generate revenue related to our ownership of the minerals and separately related to our ownership of the surface the ownership of mineral rights and surface acres may be held by two separate parties materials that can be mined from the surface and whose value comes from factors other than their chemical composition typically belong to the surface owner examples of surface materials include rock sand gravel dirt and topsoil the mineral owner holds the title to commodities that derive value from their unique chemical composition examples of mineral rights include oil gas coal even if mined at the surface and precious metals if the two types of rights conflict then mineral rights generally are superior to surface rights a third type of land right is geothermal which can belong to either the surface or mineral owner we routinely reserve mineral and geothermal rights when selling surface timberlands acreage 

timberlands products 



how we measure our product 

we report timberlands data in cubic meters cubic meters measure the total volume of wood fiber in a tree or log that we can sell cubic meter volume is determined from the large and smallend diameters and length and provides a comparative measure of timber and log volume among operating regions species size and seasons of the year 

we also use multiple units of measure when transacting business including 

 where we do it 

our timberlands assets are located primarily in north america in the us we own and manage sustainable timberlands in nine states for use in wood products and pulp and paper manufacturing we own or lease 

 

we also own and operate nurseries and seed orchards in washington oregon south carolina and georgia  

our international operations are located in uruguay where we own 298000  acres and have longterm leases on 25000  acres in canada we manage timberlands under longterm licenses that provide raw material for our manufacturing facilities these licenses are in alberta british columbia ontario license is managed by partnership and saskatchewan 

our total timber inventory — including timber on owned and leased land— is approximately 350 million  cubic meters the amount of timber inventory does not translate into an amount of lumber or panel products because the quantity of end products 

   weyerhaeuser company  2015 annual report and form 10k   3 

the species size and grade of the trees affects the relative value of our timberlands 

we maintain our timber inventory in an integrated resource inventory and geographic information system “gis” the resource inventory component of the system is proprietary and is largely based on internally developed technologies including growth and yield models developed by our research and development organization the gis component is based on gis software that is viewed as the standard in our industry 

timber inventory data collection and verification techniques include the use of industry standard field sampling procedures as well as proprietary remote sensing technologies in some geographies where they generate improved estimates the data is collected and maintained at the timber stand level 

united states 

summary of 2015  united states standing timber inventory

we provide a constant year round flow of logs to internal and thirdparty customers we sell grade logs to mills that manufacture a diverse range of products including lumber plywood and veneer we also sell chips and fiber logs to pulp paper and oriented strand board mills we also sell standing timber to third parties our timberlands are well located to take advantage of road logging and transportation systems for efficient delivery of logs to these customers 

western united states 

our western acres are well situated to serve the wood product markets in oregon and washington in addition our location on the west coast provides access to highervalue export markets for douglas fir and whitewood logs in japan china and korea the size and quality of our western timberlands coupled with their proximity to several deepwater port facilities positions us to meet the needs of pacific rim log markets 

our lands are composed primarily of douglas fir a species highly valued for its structural strength our coastal lands also contain whitewood and have a higher proportion of hemlock and other whitewoods than our interior holdings our management systems provide us a competitive operating advantage and range from research and forestry to technical planning models mechanized harvesting and marketing and logistics 

on july 23 2013 we purchased 100 percent of the equity interests in longview timber llc longview timber for 158 billion cash and assumed debt of 107 billion for an aggregate purchase price of 265 billion longview timber was a privatelyheld delaware limited liability company engaged in the ownership and management of approximately 645000 acres of timberlands in oregon and washington more information on this transaction can be found in note 4 acquisitions  in the notes to consolidated financial statements

southern united states 

our southern acres predominantly contain southern yellow pine and encompass timberlands in seven states 

we intensively manage our timber plantations using forestry research and planning systems to optimize grade log production we also actively manage our land to capture revenues from our oil gas and hard minerals resources we do this while providing quality habitat for a range of animals and birds we lease more than 94 percent of our acres to the public and state wildlife agencies for recreational purposes

our timberland acres in uruguay are split approximately 49 percent loblolly pine and 51 percent eucalyptus loblolly pine comprises more of our timber inventory due to its older age on average the timber in uruguay is in the second third of its rotation age it is entering into that part of the growth rotation when we will see increased volume accretion about 97 percent of the area to be planted has been afforested to date 

2015  international inventory by species uruguay 

in uruguay the target rotation ages are 21 to 22 years for pine and 14 to 17 years for eucalyptus we manage both species to a grade appearance regime

 when the volume is harvested we pay the province at stumpage rates set by the government and generally based on prevailing market prices the harvested logs are transferred to our manufacturing facilities at cost stumpage plus harvest haul and overhead costs less any margin on selling logs to third parties any profit from harvesting the log through to converting it to a finished product is recognized at the respective mill in either the cellulose fibers or wood products segment 



fiveyear summary of timberlands fee harvest volumes 



our timberlands annual fee harvest volumes represents the depletion of the timber assets we own depletion is a method of expensing the cost of establishing the fee timber asset base over the harvest or timber sales volume 

our fee harvest volumes are managed sustainably across all regions to ensure the preservation of longterm economic value of the timber and to capture maximum value from the markets this is accomplished by ensuring annual harvest schedules target financially mature timber and reforestation activities align with the growing of timber through its life cycle to financial maturity

we are subject to a multitude of laws and regulations in the operation of our businesses we also participate in voluntary certification of our timberlands to assure that we sustain their values including the protection of wildlife and water quality changes in law and regulation or certification standards can significantly affect our business 

regulations affecting forestry practices 

in the united states regulations established by federal state and local government agencies to protect water quality and wetlands could affect future harvests and forest management practices on some of our timberlands forest practice laws and regulations that affect present or future harvest and forest management activities in certain states include 

 each state in which we own timberlands has developed best management practices to reduce the effects of forest practices on water quality and aquatic habitats additional and more stringent regulations may be adopted by various state and local governments to achieve waterquality standards under the federal clean water act protect fish and wildlife habitats or achieve other public policy objectives 

in canada our forest operations are carried out on public timberlands under forest licenses with the provinces all forest operations are subject to 

    protect environmental values   and 

    encourage other stewardship values 

in canada 21 member companies of the forest products association of canada fpac including weyerhaeuser ’ s canadian subsidiary announced in may 2010 the signing of a canadian boreal forest agreement cbfa with nine environmental organizations the cbfa applies to approximately 72 million hectares of public forests licensed to fpac members and when fully implemented is expected to lead to the conservation of significant areas of canada ’ s boreal forest and protection of boreal species at risk in particular woodland caribou cbfa signatories continue to work on management plans with provincial governments and seek the participation of aboriginal and local communities in advancing the goals of the cbfa progress under the cbfa is measured and reported on by an independent auditor 

endangered species protections 

in the united states a number of fish and wildlife species that inhabit geographic areas near or within our timberlands have been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal endangered species act esa or similar state laws such as 

 additional species or populations may be listed as threatened or endangered as a result of pending or future citizen petitions or petitions initiated by federal or state agencies in addition significant citizen litigation seeks to compel the federal agencies to designate critical habitat for esalisted species and many cases have resulted in settlements under which designations will be implemented over time such designations may adversely affect some management activities and options restrictions on timber harvests can result from 

 

such actions could increase our operating costs and affect timber supply and prices in general to date we do not believe that these measures have had and we do not believe that in 2016  they will have a significant effect on our harvesting operations we anticipate that likely future actions will not disproportionately affect weyerhaeuser as compared with comparable operations of us competitors 

in canada 

 

the identification and protection of habitat and the implementation of range plans and land use action plans may over time result in additional restrictions on timber harvests and other forest management practices that could increase operating costs for operators of timberlands in canada to date we do not believe that these canadian measures have had and we do not believe that in 2016  they will have a significant effect on our harvesting operations we anticipate that likely future measures will not disproportionately affect weyerhaeuser as compared with similar operations of canadian competitors 

  weyerhaeuser company  2015 annual report and form 10k   18 

forest certification standards 

we operate in north america under the sustainable forestry initiative sfi ®  this is a certification standard designed to supplement government regulatory programs with voluntary landowner initiatives to further protect certain public resources and values sfi ®  is an independent standard overseen by a governing board consisting of 

 ongoing compliance with sfi ®  may result in some increases in our operating costs and curtailment of our timber harvests in some areas there also is competition from other private certification systems primarily the forest stewardship council fsc coupled with efforts by supporters to further those systems by persuading customers of forest products to require products certified to their preferred system certain features of the fsc system could impose additional operating costs on timberland management because of the considerable variation in fsc standards and variability in how those standards are interpreted and applied if sufficient marketplace demand develops for products made from raw materials sourced from other than sficertified forests we could incur substantial additional costs for operations and be required to reduce harvest levels 

what these regulations and certification programs mean to us 

the regulatory and nonregulatory forest management programs described above have 

 we believe that these kinds of programs have not had and in 2016  will not have a significant effect on our total harvest of timber in the united states or canada however these kinds of programs may have such an effect in the future we expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these programs as compared with typical owners of comparable timberlands we also expect that these programs will not significantly disrupt our planned operations over large areas or for extended periods 

canadian aboriginal rights 

many of the canadian timberlands are subject to the constitutionally protected treaty or commonlaw rights of aboriginal peoples of canada most of british columbia bc is not covered by treaties and as a result the claims of bc’s aboriginal peoples relating to forest resources have been largely unresolved on june 26 2014 the supreme court of canada ruled that the tsilhqot’in nation holds aboriginal title to approximately 1900 square kilometers in bc this was the first time that the court has declared title to exist based on historical occupation by aboriginal peoples many aboriginal groups continue to be engaged in treaty discussions with the governments of bc other provinces and canada 

final or interim resolution of claims brought by aboriginal groups can be expected to result in 

 we believe that such claims will not have a significant effect on our total harvest of timber or production of forest products in 2016  although they may have such an effect in the future in 2008 fpac of which we are a member signed a memorandum of understanding with the assembly of first nations under which the parties agree to work together to strengthen canada ’ s forest sector through economicdevelopment initiatives and business investments strong environmental stewardship and the creation of skilldevelopment opportunities particularly targeted to aboriginal youth 

pollutioncontrol regulations 

our operations are subject to various laws and regulations including 

 these laws and regulations as well as market demands impose controls with regard to 

 compliance with these laws regulations and demands usually involves capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs we cannot easily quantify the future amounts of capital expenditures we might have to make to comply with these laws regulations and demands or the effects on our operating costs because in some instances compliance standards have not been developed or have not become final or definitive in addition it is difficult to isolate the environmental component of most manufacturing capital projects 

  weyerhaeuser company  2015 annual report and form 10k   19 

our capital projects typically are designed to 

 we had capital expenditures of 23 million relating primarily to environmental compliance in 2015  based on our understanding of current regulatory requirements in the us and canada we expect no material capital expenditures relating primarily to environmental compliance in 2016  

environmental cleanup 

we are involved in the environmental investigation or remediation of numerous sites of these sites 

 our liability with respect to these various sites ranges from insignificant to substantial the amount of liability depends on 

 we spent approximately 7 million  in 2015  and expect to spend approximately 7 million in 2016  on environmental remediation of these sites 

it is our policy to accrue for environmentalremediation costs when we 

 we currently believe it is reasonably possible that our costs to remediate all the identified sites may exceed our current accruals of 37 million  the excess amounts required may be insignificant or could range in the aggregate up to 116 million  over several years this estimate of the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs is much less certain than the estimates we currently are using to determine how much to accrue the estimate of the upper range also uses assumptions less favorable to us among the range of reasonably possible outcomes 

regulation of air emissions in the us 

the united states environmental protection agency epa has promulgated regulations for air emissions from 

 these regulations cover 

 between 2011 and 2015 epa issued three related portions of new mact standards for industrial boilers and process heaters epa had completed a technology and residual risk review for mact standards applicable to pulping and bleaching operations at pulp and paper manufacturing facilities in 2012 and in 2014 had issued a revised new source performance standard for kraft pulp mills these latter two rules apply on a project specific basis when certain thresholds are exceeded as a result we cannot predict whether or when those rules may have a material impact on future projects regarding other recent final actions by the epa we do not expect any material expenditures in 2016 to comply with mact standards 

the epa must still promulgate 

 we cannot currently quantify the amount of capital we will need in the future to comply with new regulations being developed by the epa because final rules have not been promulgated 

in 2010 epa issued a final greenhouse gas rule limiting the growth of emissions from new projects meeting certain thresholds on june 23 2014 the us supreme court issued a decision that removed potential applicability of the underlying 2010 regulations based solely on greenhouse gas emissions and limited application of the rule’s technology requirements to larger emission sources as a result of new emissions from nongreenhouse gas pollutants as a result of this supreme court ruling epa is expected to issue new regulations to set thresholds for when the greenhouse gas technology requirements apply if the nongreenhouse gas emissions trigger the rule in the first instance the impact of the supreme court ruling is to end the potential applicability of the technology requirements for our smaller manufacturing operations and limit the applicability for our other operations 

in 2015 epa issued an extensive regulatory program for new and existing electric utility generating units to scale back emissions of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide co2 arising from fossil fuel use to generate electricity epa also proposed additional regulations related to how states and federal agencies may implement the requirements finalized in 2015 this regulatory program potentially will have indirect impacts on our operations such as from rising purchased electricity prices or from mandated energy demand reductions that could apply to our mills and other facilities that we operate we are evaluating the regulations and additional proposals but are not able to predict whether the regulations when complete and implemented will have a material impact on our operations 

  weyerhaeuser company  2015 annual report and form 10k   20 

we use significant biomass for energy production at our mills epa is currently working on rules regarding regulation of biomass emissions 

the impact of these greenhouse gas and biomass rules as well as recent court decisions on our operations remains uncertain 

to address concerns about greenhouse gases as a pollutant we 

 additional factors that could affect greenhouse gas emissions in the future include 

 we believe these developments have not had and in 2016  will not have a significant effect on our operations although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations we maintain an active forestry research program to track and understand any potential effect from actual climate change related parameters that could affect the forests we own and manage and do not anticipate any disruptions to our planned operations 

regulation of air emissions in canada 

in addition to existing provincial air quality regulations the canadian federal government has proposed an air quality management system aqms as a comprehensive national approach for improving air quality in canada the federal proposed aqms includes 

 environment canada is developing a “ greenhouse gas emission framework ”  that is expected to be proposed in 2016 with implementation in 2020 the framework will put in place a national sectorbased greenhouse gas reduction program applicable to a number of industries including pulp and paper manufacturing 

all canadian provincial governments 

 in addition british columbia has adopted a carbon tax and alberta has a mandatory ghg emission reduction regulation our grande prairie alberta cellulose fiber mill generates and sells carbon credits 

we believe these measures have not had and in 2016  will not have a significant effect on our operations although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations we also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations 

regulation of air emissions in poland and uruguay 

the european union ’ s “ clean air programme ”  includes new air quality objectives that poland and other european union countries will implement through 2030 some provinces in uruguay have established air quality monitoring networks and ambient air objectives have been proposed for the region where our los piques mill is located 

we believe these measures have not had and in 2016  will not have a significant effect on our operations although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations we also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations  

regulation of water 

in the us as a result of litigation under the federal clean water act additional federal or state permits are now required in some states for the application of pesticides including herbicides on timberlands those permits have entailed additional costs in addition there are continuing regulatory developments and continuing litigation in the federal courts that may result in permit requirements for pollution discharges from forest roads and other drainage features on timberland which would entail additional costs for forest landowners including weyerhaeuser finally federal regulatory agencies adopted rules in 2015 that potentially expand the definition of waters subject to federal clean water act jurisdiction which could increase the scope and number of permits required for forestryrelated activities and entail additional costs for weyerhaeuser and other forest landowners in the us those rules have been challenged in federal court by multiple parties and states and an injunction has been entered that prevents them from going into effect we are not able to predict the ultimate resolution of these pending legal actions 

in august 2014 epa issued a final regulation on thermal cooling water intakes for the protection of aquatic resources the final rule is not expected to have a material impact although the technology requirements to protect aquatic resources outlined in the rule may be applied on a casebycase basis when water permits are renewed 

  weyerhaeuser company  2015 annual report and form 10k   21 

in 2015 washington state department of ecology wa doe and the regional federal epa proposed rules to update the human health water quality criteria for the protection of human health it is unclear what effect if any the proposed rules will have on our manufacturing operations in washington state 

in addition 

 we believe the above developments have not had and in 2016 will not have a significant effect on our operations although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations we also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations 

potential changes in pollution regulation 

state governments continue to promulgate total maximum daily load tmdl requirements for pollutants in water bodies that do not meet state or epa water quality standards state tmdl requirements may 

 it is not possible to estimate the capital expenditures that may be required for us to meet pollution allocations across the various proposed state tmdl programs until a specific tmdl is promulgated 

in canada various levels of government have been working to address water issues including use quality and management recent areas of focus include water allocation regional watershed protection protection of drinking water water pricing and a national water quality index

risk factors 

we are subject to various risks and events that could adversely affect our business our financial condition our results of operations our cash flows and the price of our common stock 

you should consider the following risk factors in addition to the information presented elsewhere in this report particularly in “ forwardlooking statements ” and  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as in the filings we make from time to time with the sec in evaluating us our business and an investment in our securities 

the risks discussed below are not the only risks we face additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely affect our business 



macroeconomic conditions 

the industries in which we operate are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions and consequently are highly cyclical 

the overall levels of demand for the products we manufacture and distribute reflect fluctuations in levels of enduser demand which consequently impact our sales and profitability enduser demand depends in part on general macroeconomic conditions both in the us and globally as well as on local economic conditions current economic conditions in the united states reflect growth at or below historical trends and general business uncertainty global economic conditions reflect issues such as inflation and slowing growth in emerging countries the construction and homebuilding industries continue to slowly recover from the severe downturn caused by the overall collapse of credit markets and recession of 2009 however construction activity remains below prerecession and trend levels our wood products segment is highly dependent on the strength of the homebuilding industry the decline in home construction activity due to the recession resulted in depressed prices of and reduced demand for wood products and building materials this resulted in lower prices and demand for logs and reduced harvests in our timberlands segment the length and magnitude of industry cycles vary over time and by product but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions and levels of industry capacity those conditions have improved since the recession but if macroeconomic conditions do not continue to improve we could experience lower sales volumes and smaller margins 

commodity products 

many of our products are commodities that are widely available from other producers 

because commodity products have few distinguishing properties from producer to producer competition for these products is based primarily on price which is determined by supply relative to demand and competition from substitute products in addition prices for our products are affected by many other factors outside of our control as a result we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes which often are volatile our profitability with respect to these products depends in part on managing our costs particularly raw material and energy costs which represent significant components of our operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control both sales and profitability of our products are subject to volatility due to market forces beyond our control 

industry supply of logs wood products and pulp 

excess supply of products may adversely affect prices and margins 

oversupply of products may result from producers introducing new capacity for manufactured products or increasing harvest levels in response to favorable shortterm pricing trends industry supplies of pulp are also influenced by global production capacity which has grown in recent years and is expected to continue to grow continuation of these factors could adversely affect our sales volumes and margins 

homebuilding market and economic risks 

high unemployment low demand and low levels of consumer confidence can adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our business is dependent upon the health of the us housing market demand for homes is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as the level of employment consumer confidence consumer income the availability of financing and interest rate levels the legacy of the housing bubble its collapse and ensuing credit crisis was tightened credit requirements and a reduced number of mortgage loans available for financing home purchases although credit conditions have eased they remain more restrictive than prior to the housing bubble demand for new homes also has been adversely affected by factors such as unemployment and lower job participation limited wage growth and weak consumer confidence additionally rising student loan debt among younger adults is limiting access to mortgage financing and home ownership foreclosure rates and distress sales of houses have fallen significantly and are less of an impact compared to the years immediately following the housing collapse 

homebuyers’ ability to qualify for and obtain affordable mortgages could be affected by changes in government sponsored entities and private mortgage insurance companies supporting the mortgage market 

the federal government has historically had a significant role in supporting mortgage lending through its sponsorship of fannie mae and freddie mac as a result of turbulence in credit markets and the mortgage finance industry in the last few years the effect of the federal government ’ s conservatorship of these government sponsored entities on the shortterm and longterm demand for new housing remains unclear   the liquidity provided to the mortgage industry by fannie mae and freddie mac both of which purchase home mortgages and mortgagebacked securities originated by mortgage lenders is critical to the housing market there have been significant concerns about the future purpose of fannie mae and freddie mac and a number of proposals to curtail their activities over time are under review limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these entities could adversely affect interest rates and the availability of mortgage financing which could reduce demand for housing and adversely affect demand for our products 

  weyerhaeuser company  2015 annual report and form 10k   24 

changes in mortgage interest expense and real estate tax regulations could harm our future sales and earnings 

significant costs of homeownership include mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes both of which are generally deductible for an individual ’ s federal and in some cases state income taxes any changes to income tax laws by the federal government or a state government to eliminate or substantially reduce these income tax deductions as has been considered from time to time would increase the aftertax cost of owning a home increases in real estate taxes by local governmental authorities would also increase the cost of homeownership any such increases to the cost of homeownership could adversely affect the demand for our products 

capital markets 

deterioration in economic conditions and the credit markets could adversely affect our access to capital 

upset financial or credit market conditions can impair the company ’ s ability to borrow money or otherwise access credit markets on terms acceptable to us which may among other impacts reduce our ability to take advantage of growth and expansion opportunities similarly our customers may be unable to borrow money to fund their operations similarly deteriorating or volatile market conditions could have an adverse effect on our customers and suppliers and their ability to purchase our products or sell products to us 

changes in credit ratings 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results actions that we take their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing the company on a watch list for possible future downgrading downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading could limit our access to the credit markets increase our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

substitution 

some of our products are vulnerable to declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials 

our products may compete with nonfiberbased alternatives or with alternative products in certain market segments for example plastic woodplastic or composite materials may be used by builders as alternatives to the products produced by our wood products businesses such as lumber veneer plywood and oriented strand board changes in prices for oil chemicals and woodbased fiber can change the competitive position of our products relative to available alternatives and could increase substitution of those products for our products if use of these alternative products grows demand for and pricing of our products could be adversely affected 

changes in product mix or pricing 

our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by changes in product mix or pricing 

our results may be adversely affected by a change in our product mix or pricing if we are not successful in implementing previously announced or future price increases or in our plans to increase sales of higherpriced highervalue products or if there are delays in acceptance of price increases or failure of customers to accept higherpriced products our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected price discounting if required to maintain our competitive position could result in lower than anticipated price realizations 

intense competition 

we face intense competition in our markets and the failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we compete with north american and for many of our product lines global producers some of which may have greater financial resources and lower production costs than we do the principal basis for competition for many of our products is selling price our ability to maintain satisfactory margins depends in large part on our ability to control our costs our industries also are particularly sensitive to other factors including innovation design quality and service with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line to the extent that one or more of our competitors become more successful with respect to any key competitive factor our ability to attract and retain customers could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to compete effectively such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

expiration of the softwood lumber agreement creates uncertainty about competition from canadian imports  

historically canada has been a significant source of lumber for the us market particularly in the new home construction market we produce lumber in our canadian mills but the bulk of our production is in the us the softwood lumber agreement sla between canada and the us originally signed in october 2006 expired in october 2015 the 2006 sla required canadian softwood lumber facilities including our mills to pay an export tax when the price of lumber is at or below a threshold price we are not able to predict when or if a new agreement will be reached or if reached what the terms of the agreement would be we could experience downward pressure on timber and lumber prices caused by canadian lumber imports 

another emerging form of competition is between brands of sustainably produced products customer demand for certain brands could reduce competition among buyers for our products or cause other adverse effects 

in north america our forests are third partycertified to the sustainable forestry initiative sfi ®  standard some of our customers have expressed a preference in certain of our product lines for products made from raw materials sourced from forests certified to different standards including standards of the forest stewardship council fsc if and to the extent that preference for a standard other than sfi ® becomes a customer requirement there may be reduced demand and lower prices for our products relative to competitors who can supply products sourced from forests certified to competing certification standards if we seek to comply with such other standards we could incur materially increased costs for our operations or be required to modify our operations such as reducing harvest levels fsc in particular employs standards that are geographically variable and could cause a material reduction in the harvest levels of some of our timberlands most notably in the pacific northwest 

  weyerhaeuser company  2015 annual report and form 10k   25 

material disruption of manufacturing 

a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales or negatively affect our results of operation and financial condition 

any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

 any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products or require us to make unplanned capital expenditures if one of our facilities or machines were to incur significant downtime our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired resulting in lower sales and income although some risks are not insurable and some coverage is limited we purchase insurance protecting our manufacturing facilities from fires floods windstorms earthquakes equipment failures and boiler explosions 

strategic initiatives 

our business and financial results may be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully execute on important strategic initiatives   

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results these strategic initiatives are designed to improve our results of operations and drive longterm shareholder value and include among others maximizing cash flow through operational excellence reducing costs to achieve industryleading cost structure and innovating in highermargin products  

we may be unsuccessful in carrying out our acquisition strategy 

we intend to strategically pursue acquisitions of timberland properties when market conditions warrant as with any investment our acquisitions may not perform in accordance with our expectations in addition we anticipate financing such acquisitions through cash from operations borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities proceeds from equity or debt offerings or proceeds from asset dispositions or any combination thereof our inability to finance future acquisitions on favorable terms could adversely affect our results of operations 

capital requirements 

our operations require substantial capital 

our businesses require substantial capital for expansion and for repair or replacement of existing facilities or equipment although we maintain our production equipment with regular scheduled maintenance key pieces of equipment may need to be repaired or replaced periodically the costs of repairing or replacing such equipment and the associated downtime of the affected production line could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

while we believe our capital resources will be adequate to meet our current projected operating needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements if for any reason we are unable to provide for our operating needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements on acceptable economic terms we could experience a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

environmental laws and regulations 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with violations of or liabilities under applicable environmental laws and other laws and regulations 

we are subject to a wide range of general and industryspecific laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing 

 we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations and as a result of remedial obligations we also could incur substantial costs such as civil or criminal fines 

  weyerhaeuser company  2015 annual report and form 10k   26 

sanctions and enforcement actions including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions cleanup and closure costs and thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations 

as the owner and operator of real estate we may be liable under environmental laws for cleanup closure and other damages resulting from the presence and release of hazardous substances on or from our properties or operations in addition surface water management regulations may present liabilities and are subject to change the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict and in some cases our liability may exceed forecasted amounts or the value of the property itself the discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at our sites or thirdparty sites may result in significant additional costs any material liability we incur could adversely affect our financial condition or preclude us from making capital expenditures that otherwise would benefit our business 

we also anticipate public policy developments at the state federal and international level regarding climate change and energy access security and competitiveness we expect these developments to address emission of carbon dioxide renewable energy and fuel standards and the monetization of carbon compliance with regulations that implement new public policy in these areas might require significant expenditures these developments may also include mandated changes to energy use and building codes which could affect our homebuilding practices enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretation of these laws or regulations might require significant expenditures we also anticipate public policy developments at the state federal and international level regarding taxes and a number of other areas that could require significant expenditures 

changes in global or regional climate conditions and governmental response to such changes at the international us federal and state levels may affect our operations or our planned or future growth activities 

there continue to be numerous international us federal and statelevel initiatives and proposals to address domestic and global climate issues within the us and canada some of these proposals would and have in some canadian provinces regulate andor tax the production of carbon dioxide and other “greenhouse gases” to facilitate the reduction of carbon compound emissions into the atmosphere and provide tax and other incentives to produce and use “cleaner” energy climate change impacts if they occur and governmental initiatives laws and regulations to address potential climate concerns could increase our costs and have a longterm adverse impact on our businesses and results of operations future legislation or regulatory activity in this area remains uncertain and its impact on our operations is unclear at this time however it is possible that legislation or government mandates standards or regulations intended to mitigate or reduce carbon compound or greenhouse gas emissions or other climate change impacts could adversely affect our operations for example such activities could limit harvest levels or result in significantly higher costs for energy and other raw materials because our manufacturing operations depend upon significant amounts of energy and raw materials these initiatives could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and profitability 

currency exchange rates 

we will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates 

we have manufacturing operations in canada poland and uruguay we are also a large exporter and compete with global producers of products very similar to ours therefore we are affected by changes in the strength of the us dollar particularly relative to the canadian dollar euro and yen and the strength of the euro relative to the yen changes in exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our sales volumes margins and results of operations 

availability of raw materials and energy 

our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials and energy 

we rely heavily on certain raw materials principally wood fiber and chemicals and energy sources principally natural gas electricity coal and fuel oil in our manufacturing processes our ability to increase earnings has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials and energy sources we may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material or energy costs through hedging arrangements price increases productivity improvements or costreduction programs 

people 

our business is dependent upon attracting retaining and developing key personnel 

we believe that our success depends to a significant extent upon our ability to attract retain and develop key senior management and operations management personnel our failure to recruit retain and develop key personnel could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

transportation 

we depend on third parties for transportation services and increases in costs and disruptions in the availability of transportation could materially adversely affect our business and operations 

our business depends on the transportation of a large number of products both domestically and internationally we rely primarily on third parties for transportation of the products we manufacture or distribute as well as delivery of our raw materials a significant portion of the goods we manufacture and raw materials we use are transported by marine rail and truck each of which is highly regulated in addition each has historically been subject to periodic disruption due to labor issues 

if any of our thirdparty transportation providers were to fail to deliver the goods we manufacture or distribute in a timely manner we may be unable to sell those products at full value or at all similarly if any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner we may be unable to manufacture our products in response to customer demand in addition if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us we may be unable to replace them at reasonable cost our thirdparty transportation providers are also subject to events outside of their control such as disruption of transportation infrastructure due to labor issues or natural disasters 

any failure of a thirdparty transportation provider to deliver raw materials or finished products in a timely manner could harm our reputation negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation 

in addition an increase in transportation rates or fuel surcharges could materially adversely affect our sales and profitability

reit status and tax implications 

if we fail to remain qualified as a reit our taxable income would be subject to tax at corporate rates and we would not be able to deduct dividends to shareholders 

in any taxable year in which we fail to qualify as a reit unless we are entitled to relief under the internal revenue code 

 qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code to our operations and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions although we operate in a manner consistent with the reit qualification rules we cannot assure you that we are or will remain so qualified 

certain of our business activities are subject to corporatelevel income tax and potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax 

under the internal revenue code reits generally must engage in the ownership and management of income producing real estate for the company this generally includes owning and managing a timberland portfolio for the production and sale of standing timber accordingly the harvesting and sale of logs the development or sale of certain timberlands and other real estate the manufacture and sale of wood products and the manufacture and sale of pulp products are conducted through one or more of our whollyowned taxable reit subsidiaries trss because such activities could generate nonqualifying reit income and could constitute “ prohibited transactions ”  prohibited transactions are defined by the internal revenue code generally to be sales or other dispositions of property to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business by conducting our business in this manner we believe that we satisfy the reit requirements of the internal revenue code and are not subject to the 100 percent tax that could be imposed if a reit were to conduct a prohibited transaction the net income of our trss is subject to corporatelevel income tax 

the extent of our use of our trs may affect the price of our common shares relative to the share price of other reits 

we conduct a significant portion of our business activities through one or more trss our use of our trss enables us to engage in nonreit qualifying business activities such as the sale of logs production and sale of wood products and pulp products and sale of hbu property our trss are subject to corporatelevel tax therefore we pay income taxes on the income generated by our trss under the code no more than 25 percent 20 percent after december 31 2017 of the value of the gross assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trs this limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our trss ’  operations furthermore our use of trss may cause the market to value our common shares differently than the shares of other reits which may not use trss as extensively as we use them 

we may be limited in our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our taxable reit subsidiaries 

the ability of the reit to receive dividends from our trs is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a reit in particular at least 75 percent of gross income for each taxable year as a reit must be derived from passive real estate sources including sales of our standing timber and other types of qualifying real estate income and no more than 25 percent of our gross income may consist of dividends from our trs and other nonreal estate income 

this limitation on our ability to receive dividends from our trss may affect our ability to fund cash distributions to our shareholders using cash flows from our trss the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed and income that is not distributed will not be subject to the reit income distribution requirement 

our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate 

generally reits are required to distribute 90 percent of their ordinary taxable income and 95 percent of their net capital gains income capital gains may be retained by the reit but would be subject to income taxes if capital gains are retained rather than distributed our shareholders would be notified and they would be deemed to have received a taxable distribution with a refundable credit for any federal income tax paid by the reit accordingly we believe that we are not required to distribute material amounts of cash since substantially all of our taxable income is treated as capital gains income our board of directors in its sole discretion determines the amount of quarterly dividends to be provided to our shareholders based on consideration of a number of factors these factors include but are not limited to our results of operations cash flow and capital requirements economic conditions tax considerations borrowing capacity and other factors including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments future acquisitions and divestitures harvest levels changes in the price and demand for our products and general market demand for timberlands including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses consequently our dividend levels may fluctuate 

changes in tax laws or their interpretation could adversely affect our shareholders and our results of operations 

federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process the internal revenue service the united states department of the treasury and state taxing authorities changes to tax laws could adversely affect our shareholders or increase our effective tax rates we cannot predict with certainty whether when in what forms or with what effective dates the tax laws applicable to us or our shareholders may be changed

  weyerhaeuser company  2015 annual report and form 10k   32 




 

legal proceedings 

we are a party to a number of legal proceedings and adverse judgments in certain legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

the costs and other effects of pending litigation against us and related insurance recoveries cannot be determined with certainty although the disclosure in note 15 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies  of notes to consolidated financial statements  contains management ’ s current views of the effect such litigation will have on our financial results there can be no assurance that the outcome of such proceedings will be as expected 

it is possible that there could be adverse judgments against us in some or all major litigation against us and that we could be required to take a charge and make cash payments for all or a portion of any damage award any such charge or cash payment could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows for the quarter or year in which we record or pay it 

importexport taxes and duties 

we may be required to pay significant taxes on our exported products or countervailing and antidumping duties on our imported products 

international trade disputes occur frequently and can be taken to an international trade court for resolution of unfair trade practices between countries as an example there have been many disputes and subsequent trade agreements regarding sales of softwood lumber between canada and the united states the softwood lumber agreement sla between canada and the us originally signed in october 2006 expired in october 2015 a new agreement has not been reached the sla required canadian softwood lumber facilities including our mills to pay an export tax when the price of lumber is at or below a threshold price which could be as high as 225 percent if a province exceeds its total allotted export share as well as potentially impose additional countervailing antidumping duties we could experience reduced revenues and margins in any business that is subject to such tariffs or to the terms of the settlements of such international disputes to the extent such tariffs increase prices they could also reduce the demand for our products these tariffs or settlement terms could have a material adverse effect on our business financial results and financial condition including facility closures or impairments of assets we cannot predict whether or when there will be a further extension of the sla or a new agreement or if any extension or new agreement is completed its impact on our business 

distribution of wreco shares 

we could incur substantial us federal tax liability if the wreco transaction were found not to qualify as a taxfree “reorganization” or the distribution of wreco shares to weyerhaeuser shareholders were found not to qualify as a taxfree distribution 

in 2014 we closed the divestiture of our home building business weyerhaeuser real estate company wreco via a reverse morris trust transaction pursuant to which a wholly  owned subsidiary of tri pointe homes inc tri pointe merged with and into wreco with wreco surviving the merger and becoming a wholly  owned subsidiary of tri pointe the reverse morris trust transaction was structured to qualify as a taxfree reorganization and the associated distribution of wreco shares to weyerhaeuser shareholders as a taxfree distribution if the transaction were determined not to qualify as a taxfree reorganization   or if the distribution does not qualify as a taxfree distribution then weyerhaeuser or its subsidiaries or weyerhaeuser shareholders may be required to pay substantial us federal income taxes 

if the transaction were determined not to qualify as a taxfree reorganization or the distribution not to qualify as a taxfree distribution or if weyerhaeuser were required to indemnify tri pointe and wreco such taxes and indemnification obligations could be substantial and could materially and adversely affect the company’s liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

our merger with plum creek timber company inc 

the merger may not be completed on the terms currently contemplated or at all 

on november 6 2015 weyerhaeuser company and plum creek timber company inc “plum creek” entered into an agreement and plan of merger “merger agreement” pursuant to which plum creek will merge with and into weyerhaeuser company with weyerhaeuser continuing as the surviving corporation if the merger is not completed our businesses may be adversely affected and we may be subject to various risks without realizing any of the benefits of having the merger completed including the following 

 a delay in completing the merger which is subject to a number of conditions some of which are outside our control may reduce or eliminate the expected benefits from the merger 

the merger is subject to a number of conditions some of which are beyond our control that could prevent delay or otherwise materially adversely affect its completion we cannot predict whether and when the conditions will be satisfied in addition several putative class action lawsuits relating to the merger have been filed and additional lawsuits may be filed which could delay completion of the merger we intend to vigorously defend the litigation but we cannot predict the outcome the requirement to obtain certain regulatory approvals could delay the completion of the merger for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring a delay in completing the merger could cause the combined company not to realize some or all of the synergies and other benefits that it expects to achieve if the merger is successfully completed within its expected time frame the merger agreement contains certain restrictions on the conduct of our business if the merger is delayed these restrictions could adversely affect our ability to execute business strategies or pursue attractive business opportunities   in addition a delay could cause management to focus on completion of the merger instead of on other opportunities that could be beneficial to the company 

  weyerhaeuser company  2015 annual report and form 10k   29 

the merger will involve substantial costs and the combined company may be unable to successfully integrate the businesses of the two companies and realize the anticipated benefits of the merger  

we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial costs and expenses relating directly to the merger including fees and expenses payable to financial and other professional advisors sec filing fees printing and mailing costs and other transactionrelated costs fees and expenses we expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of the businesses   policies procedures operations employees technologies and systems of plum creek with those of weyerhaeuser there are a large number of systems that must be integrated including management information purchasing accounting and finance sales billing payroll and benefits fixed asset and lease administration systems and regulatory compliance expenses related to this integration are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately these expenses could particularly in the near term exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from the realization of economies of scale and cost savings and synergies related to the integration of the businesses these integration expenses likely will result in significant charges against earnings following the completion of the merger but the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain 

the merger involves the combination of two independently operated public companies the merger will require management to devote significant attention and resources to integrating business practices and operations the combined company may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the merger if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected 

uncertainties associated with the merger may adversely affect our business and operations  

uncertainties associated with the merger could cause customers suppliers or other entities with whom we have a business relationship to delay or defer decisions which could negatively impact our revenues earnings and cash flows in addition customers or suppliers may elect to cease doing business with us or the combined company in anticipation of or following the merger or seek to take advantage of potential uncertainty or disruption resulting from the merger to interfere with relationships with customers suppliers or employees 

we are dependent on the valuable experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other employees to execute our business plans and successfully conduct operations our success after the merger will depend in part upon our ability to retain key personnel current and prospective employees may feel uncertain about their roles following the merger which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel  

the market price of our common stock may decline in the future as a result of the merger  

the market price of our common stock may decline in the future as a result of the merger for a number of reasons including our inability to successfully integrate the two companies or our failure to achieve the perceived benefits of the merger including financial results as rapidly as or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts failure to successfully integrate the two companies could negatively impact our revenues earnings and cash flows and could materially adversely affect our ability to pay dividends at historical levels or at all 

the combined company may incur adverse tax consequences if either weyerhaeuser or plum creek has failed or fails to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes  

each of weyerhaeuser and plum creek has operated in a manner that it believes has allowed it to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes under the code see “reit status and tax implications” above for a description of the reit requirements and consequences of failing to maintain reit status we intend to operate in a manner that allows us to continue to qualify as a reit after the merger however even if we have operated so as to retain our reit status if plum creek were to lose its reit status for a taxable year before the merger or that includes the merger we will face serious tax consequences that could substantially reduce cash available for distribution to our shareholders and significantly impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital if the merger were determined not to qualify as a taxfree merger we could incur substantial federal tax liability that could materially and adversely affect the companys liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

timberland specific risks 

our ability to harvest and deliver timber may be subject to limitations which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our primary assets are our timberlands weather conditions timber growth cycles access limitations and availability of contract loggers and haulers may restrict our ability to harvest our timberlands other factors that may restrict our timber harvest include damage to our standing timber by fire or by insect infestation disease prolonged drought flooding severe weather and other natural disasters changes in global climate conditions could intensify one or more of these factors although damage from such causes usually is localized and affects only a limited percentage of standing timber there can be no assurance that any damage affecting our timberlands will in fact be limited as is common in the forest products industry we do not maintain insurance coverage for damage to our timberlands our revenues net income and cash flow from operations are dependent to a significant extent on the pricing of our products and our continued ability to harvest timber at adequate levels therefore if we were to be restricted from harvesting on a significant portion of our timberlands for a prolonged period of time or if material damage to a significant portion of our standing timber were to occur we could suffer a materially adverse impact to our results of operations 

on a shortterm basis we may adjust our timber harvest levels in response to market conditions longer term our timber harvest levels may be affected by acquisitions of additional timberlands sales of existing timberlands and shifts in harvest from one region to another in addition to timberland acquisitions and sales future timber harvest levels may be affected by changes in estimates of longterm sustainable yield because of silvicultural advances natural disasters fires pests insects and other hazards regulatory constraints and other factors beyond our control 

timber harvest activities are also subject to a number of federal state and local regulations pertaining to the protection of fish wildlife water and other resources regulations reinterpretations and litigation can restrict timber harvest activities and increase costs examples are federal and state laws protecting threatened endangered and “atrisk” species harvesting and forestry road building activities that may be restricted under the us federal clean water act state forestry practices laws laws protecting aboriginal rights and other similar regulations 

our estimates of timber inventories and growth rates may be inaccurate include risks inherent to such estimates and may impair our ability to realize expected revenues 

we rely upon estimates of merchantable timber inventories which include judgments regarding inventories that may be lawfully and economically harvested timber growth rates and endproduct yields when acquiring and managing working forests these estimates which are inherently inexact and uncertain in nature are central to forecasting our anticipated timber harvests revenues and expected cash flows timber 

  weyerhaeuser company  2015 annual report and form 10k   30 

growth rates and yield estimates are developed by forest biometricians and other experts using statistical measurements of a sample of trees on a given property timber growth equations are used that predict the rate of height and diameter growth of trees so that foresters can estimate the volume of timber that may be present in the tree stand at a given age tree growth varies by soil type geographic area and climate inappropriate application of growth equations in forest management planning may lead to inaccurate estimates of future volumes if these estimates are inaccurate our ability to manage our timberlands in a sustainable or profitable manner may be diminished which may cause our results of operations and our stock price to be adversely affected 

our operating results and cash flows will be materially affected by supply and demand for timber 

a variety of factors affect prices for timber including available supply changes in economic conditions that impact demand the level of domestic new construction and remodeling activity interest rates credit availability population growth weather conditions and pest infestation and other factors these factors vary by region timber type sawlogs or pulpwood logs and species 

timber prices are affected by changes in demand on a local national or international level the closure of a mill in the regions where we own timber can have a material adverse effect on demand and therefore pricing as the demand for paper continues to decline closures of pulp mills have adversely affected the demand for pulpwood and wood chips in certain regions in which we operate we export logs to asia while demand for asia has remained steady recently asian markets have experienced a high degree of volatility especially in china a decrease in demand of logs from asia may have a negative impact on log and lumber in the markets in which we compete 

timber prices are affected by changes in timber availability at the local national and international level our timberland ownership is concentrated in alabama arkansas louisiana mississippi north carolina oklahoma oregon and washington in some of these states much of the timberland is privately owned increases in timber prices often result in substantial increases in harvesting on private timberlands including lands not previously made available for commercial timber operations causing a shortterm increase in supply that moderates price increases in western states such as oregon and washington where a greater proportion of timberland is government owned any substantial increase in timber harvesting from governmentowned land could significantly reduce timber prices on a local level timber supplies can fluctuate depending upon factors such as changes in weather conditions and harvest strategies of local timberland owners as well as occasionally high timber salvage efforts due to events such as unusual pest infestations or fires 

timberlands make up a significant portion of our business portfolio 

our real estate holdings are primarily timberlands and we may make additional timberlands acquisitions in the future as the owner and manager of approximately 69 million acres of timberlands we are subject to the risks that are inherent in concentrated real estate investments a downturn in the real estate industry generally or the timber or forest products industries specifically could reduce the value of our properties and adversely affect our results of operations such a downturn could also adversely affect our customers and reduce the demand for our products the risks we face may be more pronounced than if we diversified our investments outside real estate or outside timberlands 

cybersecurity risks 

we rely on information technology to support our operations and reporting environments a security failure of that technology could impact our ability to operate our businesses effectively adversely affect our reported financial results impact our reputation and expose us to potential liability or litigation 

we use information systems to carry out our operational activities and maintain our business records some systems are internally managed and some are maintained by thirdparty service providers we and our service providers employ what we believe are adequate security measures our ability to conduct business could be materially and adversely affected if these systems or resources are compromised damaged or fail this could be a result of a cyber incident natural disaster hardware or software corruption failure or error telecommunications system failure service provider error or failure intentional or unintentional personnel actions or other disruption 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property other proprietary information and personally identifiable information if this data is compromised destroyed or inappropriately disclosed it could have a material adverse effect including damage to our reputation loss of customers significant expenses to address and resolve the issues or litigation or other proceedings by affected individuals business partners andor regulators 



stockprice volatility 

the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors some of which are beyond our control 

the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors some of which are beyond our control including those described above under  risks related to our industries and business  and the following 

   weyerhaeuser company  2015 annual report and form 10k   31 

in addition there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in the forest products industry that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 

some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them if litigation of this type is brought against us it could result in substantial costs and divert management ’ s attention and resources 

preference shares 

our common shares will rank junior to our mandatory convertible preference shares with respect to dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation 

our common shares will rank junior to our mandatory convertible preference shares with respect to the payment of dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation dissolution or windingup this means that unless full cumulative dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding mandatory convertible preference shares for all past dividend periods and the then current dividend period no dividends may be declared or paid on our common shares likewise in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation dissolution or windingup no distribution of our assets may be made to holders of our common shares until we have paid to holders of the mandatory convertible preference shares a liquidation preference equal to 5000 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends 

certain provisions in the mandatory convertible preference shares could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover or takeover attempt of us and therefore the ability of holders to exercise their rights associated with a potential fundamental change 

certain provisions in our mandatory convertible preference shares could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us for example if a fundamental change were to occur on or prior to july 1 2016 holders of the mandatory convertible preference shares may have the right to convert their mandatory convertible preference shares in whole or in part at an increased conversion rate and be entitled to receive a fundamental change dividend makewhole amount equal to the present value of all remaining dividend payments on their mandatory convertible preference shares these features of the mandatory convertible preference shares could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management

our mda includes the following major sections 

 



the strength of the us housing market strongly affects our wood products and timberlands segments as published by the us census bureau total us housing starts for 2015 were 1111000 units with singlefamily units accounting for 715000 of the total this represents a 10 percent increase in singlefamily starts from 2014 which were 648000 units multifamily construction also increased in 2015 to 396000 units compared with 358000 in 2014 expectations are for a similar increase in 2016 consensus forecasts place expected total housing starts between 12 and 13 million units for 2016 sources include ihs global insight john burns real estate and risi while housing has improved significantly since the recession of 2009 current demand for new housing continues to run below historic pre bubble averages the 25year period of 19762000 averaged 15 million total starts and 11 million single family starts levels which have not yet been achieved in the post recession period 

wood products primarily sells into the new residential building and repair and remodel markets demand for wood products continued to improve in 2015 following the growth in home construction however growth in production also expanded and prices were lower in 2015 than 2014 the random lengths framing lumber composite was 14 percent lower in 2015 versus 2014 while oriented strand board osb was 4 percent lower in 2015 as measured by random lengths north central price expectations are for similar to slightly higher wood product prices in 2016 as demand continues to increase with growth in housing starts and remodeling 

demand for logs from our timberlands segment is affected by the production of woodbased building products as well as export demand in our western holdings in the south southern pine sawlog prices were flat to slightly higher in 2015 as available supplies continue to match or exceed growth in demand western log prices were lower in 2015 due primarily to the pullback in demand from china which had been actively competing with domestic lumber producers for sawlogs expectations are for slightly improved log prices as offshore demand improves over 2015 and domestic wood products manufacturing output increases with rising housing starts creating increased log demand 

cellulose fibers is primarily affected by global supply and demand factors and the relative strength of the us dollar the slowdown in global growth and reduced expectations for emerging economies slowed demand growth for pulp in 2015 the us dollar continued to strengthen versus the euro in 2015 rising 12 percent due to stronger us economic growth and increasingly accommodative monetary policies in eurozone economies consequently prices for benchmark nbsk pulp were 8 lower in 2015 versus 2014 expectations are for similar to slightly lower prices in 2016 as global economic growth is expected to be weak which will limit growth in demand for products made with cellulose fibers furthermore the us dollar is expected to remain strong relative to other currencies including the euro and a weak euro has historically been associated with lower us dollar prices for cellulose fibers

critical accounting policies 

our critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and estimates they also have a high degree of complexity 

in accounting we base our judgments and estimates on 

 actual results however may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded 

our most critical accounting policies relate to our

pension and postretirement benefit plans   

we sponsor several pension and postretirement benefit plans for our employees key assumptions we use in accounting for the plans include our 

 at the end of every year we review our assumptions with external advisers and make adjustments as appropriate actual experience that differs from our assumptions or any changes in our assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

other factors that affect our accounting for the plans include 

 this section provides more information about our 

 expected longterm rate of return on plan assets 

plan assets are assets of the pension plan trusts that fund the benefits provided under the pension plans the expected longterm rate of return is our estimate of the longterm rate of return that our plan assets will earn our expected longterm rate of return is important in determining the net periodic benefit or cost we recognize for our plans 

over the 30 years it has been in place our us pension trust investment strategy has achieved a 142 percent  net compound annual return rate 

after considering available information at the end of 2015  we continue to assume an expected longterm rate of return of 90 percent factors we considered include 

 our expected longterm rate of return is important in determining the net periodic benefit or cost we recognize for our plans every 05 percent decrease in our expected longterm rate of return would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately 

 the actual return on plan assets in any given year may vary from our expected longterm rate of return actual returns on plan assets affect the funded status of the plans differences between actual returns on plan assets and the expected longterm rate of return are reflected as adjustments to cumulative other comprehensive income loss a component of total equity 

discount rates 

our discount rates as of december 31 2015  are 

 we review our discount rates annually and revise them as needed the discount rates are selected at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of highquality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits 

pension and postretirement benefit expenses for 2016  will be based on the 45 percent  and 40 percent  assumed discount rates for us plans and 4 percent  and 39 percent  assumed discount rates for the canadian plans 

our discount rates are important in determining the cost of our plans a 05 percent decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately

longlived assets 

we review the carrying value of our longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations the carrying value is the amount assigned to longlived assets in our financial statements 

an impairment occurs when the carrying value of longlived assets will not be recovered from future cash flows and is more than fair market value fair market value is the estimated amount we would receive if we were to sell the assets 

in determining fair market value and whether impairment has occurred we are required to estimate 

 key assumptions we use in developing the estimates include 

 contingent liabilities 

we are subject to lawsuits investigations and other claims related to environmental product and other matters and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 

we record contingent liabilities when 

 assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors including 

 in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that an ultimate loss may occur 

while we do our best in developing our projections recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain if estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges in other income expense net these exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flow in any given quarter or year see note 15 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for more information

effect of market conditions 

the health of the us housing market strongly affects our wood products and timberlands segments wood products primarily sells into the new residential building and repair and remodel markets demand for logs from our timberlands segment is affected by the production of woodbased building products as well as export demand cellulose fibers is primarily affected by global demand and the relative strength of the us dollar

competition in our markets 

we operate in highly competitive domestic and foreign markets with numerous companies selling similar products many of our products also face competition from substitutes for wood and woodfiber products we compete in our markets primarily through price product quality and service levels we are relentlessly focused on improving operational excellence to ensure a competitive cost structure and producing quality products customers want and are wiling to pay for 

our business segments’ competitive strategies are as follows 

 

sales outside the us 

in 2014  25 billion  — 34 percent  — of our total consolidated sales from continuing operations were to customers outside the us the table below shows sales outside the us for the last three years 



our employees 

we have approximately 12800  employees this number includes 

 of these employees approximately 3550 are members of unions covered by multiyear collectivebargaining agreements more information about these agreements is in note 9 pension and other postretirement benefit plans   in the notes to consolidated financial statements  



this section provides information about how we 

 for each of our business segments we provide details about what we do where we do it how much we sell and where we are headed 

timberlands 

our timberlands segment manages 69 million  acres of private commercial timberlands worldwide we own 62 million  of those acres and have longterm leases on the other 07 million  acres in addition we have renewable longterm licenses on canadian timberlands the tables presented in this section include data from this segments business units as of the end of 2014  

what we do 

forestry management 

our timberlands segment 

 our goal is to maximize returns by selling logs and stumpage to internal and external customers we focus on solid wood and use intensive silviculture to improve forest productivity and returns while managing our forests on a sustainable basis to meet customer and public expectations 

sustainable forestry practices 

we are committed to responsible environmental stewardship wherever we operate managing forests to produce financially mature timber while protecting the ecosystem services they provide our working forests include places with unique environmental cultural historical or recreational value to protect their unique qualities we follow regulatory requirements voluntary standards and implement the sustainable forestry initiative ®  sfi standard independent auditing of all of the forests we own or manage in the united states and canada certifies that we meet the sfi standard our timberlands in uruguay are certified under the forest stewardship council fsc standard or the uruguayan national forestry management standard which is endorsed by the program for the endorsement of forest certification pefc 

  weyerhaeuser company  2014 annual report and form 10k   2 

canadian forestry operations 

in canada we manage timberlands under longterm licenses that provide raw material for our manufacturing facilities in various provinces when we harvest trees we pay the provinces at stumpage rates set by the government which generally are based on prevailing market prices we transfer logs to our manufacturing facilities at cost and do not generate any profit in the timberlands segment from the harvest of timber from the licensed acres in canada 

other values from our timberlands 

in the united states we actively manage mineral oil and gas leases on our land and use geologic databases to identify and market opportunities for commercial mineral and geothermal development we recognize leasing revenue over the terms of agreements with customers revenue primarily comes from 

 in managing mineral resources we generate revenue related to our ownership of the minerals and separately related to our ownership of the surface the ownership of mineral rights and surface acres may be held by two separate parties materials that can be mined from the surface and whose value comes from factors other than their chemical composition typically belong to the surface owner examples of surface materials include rock sand gravel dirt and topsoil the mineral owner holds the title to commodities that derive value from their unique chemical composition examples of mineral rights include oil gas coal even if mined at the surface and precious metals if the two types of rights conflict then mineral rights generally are superior to surface rights a third type of land right is geothermal which can belong to either the surface or mineral owner we routinely reserve mineral and geothermal rights when selling surface timberlands acreage 

timberlands products 



how we measure our product 

we report timberlands data in cubic meters cubic meters measure the total volume of wood fiber in a tree or log that we can sell cubic meter volume is determined from the large and smallend diameters and length and provides a more consistent and comparative measure of timber and log volume among operating regions species size and seasons of the year than other units of measure 

we also use multiple units of measure when transacting business including 

 where we do it 

our timberlands assets are located primarily in north america in the us we own and manage sustainable timberlands in nine states for use in wood products and pulp and paper manufacturing we own or lease 

 

we also own and operate nurseries and seed orchards in washington oregon south carolina and georgia  

our international operations are located in uruguay where we own 298000  acres and have longterm leases on 25000  acres in canada we manage timberlands under longterm licenses that provide raw material for our manufacturing facilities these licenses are in alberta british columbia ontario license is managed by partnership and saskatchewan 

our total timber inventory — including timber on owned and leased land in our us and international operations — is approximately 345 million  cubic meters the amount of timber inventory does not translate into an amount of lumber or panel products because the quantity of end products 

 the species size and grade of the trees affects the relative value of our timberlands 

we maintain our timber inventory in an integrated resource inventory and geographic information system “gis” the resource inventory component of the system is proprietary and is largely based on internally developed technologies including growth and yield models developed by our research and development organization the gis component is based on gis software that is viewed as the standard in our industry 

  weyerhaeuser company  2014 annual report and form 10k   3 

timber inventory data collection and verification techniques include the use of industry standard field sampling procedures as well as proprietary remote sensing technologies in some geographies where they generate improved estimates the data is collected and maintained at the timber stand level

we provide a constant year round flow of logs to internal and thirdparty customers we sell grade logs to mills that manufacture a diverse range of products including lumber plywood and veneer we also sell chips and fiber logs to pulp paper and oriented strand board mills our timberlands are well located to take advantage of road logging and transportation systems for efficient delivery of logs to these customers 

western united states 

our western acres are well situated to serve the wood product markets in oregon and washington in addition our location on the west coast provides access to highervalue export markets for douglas fir and whitewood logs in japan china and korea the size and quality of our western timberlands coupled with their proximity to several deepwater port facilities positions us to meet the needs of pacific rim log markets 

our lands are composed primarily of douglas fir a species highly valued for its structural strength our coastal lands also contain whitewood and have a higher proportion of whitewood than our interior holdings our management systems range from research and forestry to technical planning models mechanized harvesting and marketing and logistics they provide us a competitive operating advantage 

on july 23 2013 we purchased 100 percent of the equity interests in longview timber llc longview timber for 158 billion cash and assumed debt of 107 billion for an aggregate purchase price of 265 billion longview timber was a privatelyheld delaware limited liability company engaged in the ownership and management of approximately 645000 acres of timberlands in oregon and washington more information on this transaction can be found in note 4 longview timber purchase  in the notes to consolidated financial statements

2014  western us inventory by species 

2014  western us inventory by age  species 

the average age of timber harvested in 2014  was 52 years most of our us timberland is intensively managed for timber production but some areas are conserved for environmental historical recreational or cultural reasons some of our older trees are protected in acreage set aside for conservation and some are not yet logged due to harvest rate regulations while over the long term our average harvest age will decrease in accordance with our sustainable forestry practices we harvest generally 2 percent of our western acreage each year 

southern united states 

our southern acres predominantly contain southern yellow pine and encompass timberlands in seven states 

we intensively manage our timber plantations using forestry research and planning systems to optimize grade log production we also actively manage our land to capture revenues from our oil gas and hard minerals resources we do this while providing quality habitat for a range of animals and birds we lease more than 93 percent of our acres to the public and state wildlife agencies for recreational purposes

summary of 2014  international timberland locations 



our timberland acres in uruguay are split approximately 50 percent loblolly pine and 50 percent eucalyptus loblolly pine comprises more of our timber inventory due to its older age on average the timber in uruguay is in the second third of its rotation age it is entering into that part of the growth rotation when we will see increased volume accretion about 96 percent of the area to be planted has been afforested to date 

2014  international inventory by species uruguay 

in uruguay the target rotation ages are 21 to 22 years for pine and 14 to 17 years for eucalyptus we manage both species to a grade appearance regime 

we also operate a plywood mill in uruguay with a production capacity of 250000 cubic meters production volume reached 216000 cubic meters in 2014  

in brazil we were a managing partner in a joint venture that operated a hardwood sawmill we sold our interest in this joint venture during 2014

canada — licensed timberlands 

we manage timberlands under longterm licenses in canada from the provincial government to secure the volume for our manufacturing facilities in various provinces the provincial governments regulate the volume of timber that may be harvested each year through the annual allowable cut aac allotment which is updated every 10 years as of december 31 2014  our aac allotment was 

 when the volume is harvested we pay the province at stumpage rates set by the government and generally based on prevailing market prices the harvested logs are transferred to our manufacturing facilities at cost stumpage plus harvest haul and overhead costs less any margin on selling logs to third parties any profit from harvesting the log through to converting it to a finished product is recognized at the respective mill in either the cellulose fibers or wood products segment 



fiveyear summary of timberlands fee harvest volumes 



our timberlands annual fee harvest volumes represents the depletion of the timber assets we own depletion is a method of expensing the cost of establishing the fee timber asset base over the harvest or timber sales volume the increase in fee harvest volumes from 2010 through 2014 reflects improving market conditions the increase in fee harvest volumes in the west in 2013 and 2014 also reflects the purchase of longview timber 

our fee harvest volumes are managed sustainably across all regions to ensure the preservation of longterm economic value of the timber and to capture maximum value from the markets this is accomplished by ensuring annual harvest schedules target financially mature timber and reforestation activities align with the growing of timber through its life cycle to financial maturity

we are subject to a multitude of laws and regulations in the operation of our businesses we also participate in voluntary certification of our timberlands to assure that we sustain their values including the protection of wildlife and water quality changes in law and regulation or certification standards can significantly affect our business 

regulations affecting forestry practices 

in the united states regulations established by federal state and local government agencies to protect water quality and wetlands could affect future harvests and forest management practices on some of our timberlands forest practice laws and regulations that affect present or future harvest and forest management activities in certain states include 

 each state in which we own timberlands has developed best management practices to reduce the effects of forest practices on water quality and aquatic habitats additional and more stringent regulations may be adopted by various state and local governments to achieve waterquality standards under the federal clean water act protect fish and wildlife habitats or achieve other public policy objectives 

in canada our forest operations are carried out on public timberlands under forest licenses with the provinces all forest operations are subject to 

    protect environmental values   and 

    encourage other stewardship values 

in canada 21 member companies of the forest products association of canada fpac including weyerhaeuser ’ s canadian subsidiary announced in may 2010 the signing of a canadian boreal forest agreement cbfa with nine environmental organizations the cbfa applies to approximately 72 million hectares of public forests licensed to fpac members and when fully implemented is expected to lead to the conservation of significant areas of canada ’ s boreal forest and protection of boreal species at risk in particular woodland caribou cbfa signatories continue to work on management plans with provincial governments and seek the participation of aboriginal and local communities in advancing the goals of the cbfa progress under the cbfa is measured and reported on by an independent auditor 

endangered species protections 

in the united states a number of fish and wildlife species that inhabit geographic areas near or within our timberlands have been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal endangered species act esa or similar state laws such as 

 additional species or populations may be listed as threatened or endangered as a result of pending or future citizen petitions or petitions initiated by federal or state agencies in addition significant citizen litigation seeks to compel the federal agencies to designate critical habitat for esalisted species and many cases have resulted in settlements under which designations will be implemented over time such designations may adversely affect some management activities and options restrictions on timber harvests can result from 

 

such actions could increase our operating costs and affect timber supply and prices in general to date we do not believe that these measures have had and we do not believe that in 2015  they will have a significant effect on our harvesting operations we anticipate that likely future actions will not disproportionately affect weyerhaeuser as compared with comparable operations of us competitors 

in canada 

 

the identification and protection of habitat and the implementation of range plans and land use action plans may over time result in additional restrictions on timber harvests and other forest management practices that could increase operating costs for operators of timberlands in canada to date we do not believe that these canadian measures have had and we do not believe that in 2015  they will have a significant effect on our harvesting operations we anticipate that likely future measures will not disproportionately affect weyerhaeuser as compared with similar operations of canadian competitors 

  weyerhaeuser company  2014 annual report and form 10k   17 

forest certification standards 

we operate in north america under the sustainable forestry initiative sfi ®  this is a certification standard designed to supplement government regulatory programs with voluntary landowner initiatives to further protect certain public resources and values sfi ®  is an independent standard overseen by a governing board consisting of 

 ongoing compliance with sfi ®  may result in some increases in our operating costs and curtailment of our timber harvests in some areas there also is competition from other private certification systems primarily the forest stewardship council fsc coupled with efforts by supporters to further those systems by persuading customers of forest products to require products certified to their preferred system certain features of the fsc system could impose additional operating costs on timberland management because of the considerable variation in fsc standards and variability in how those standards are interpreted and applied if sufficient marketplace demand develops for products made from raw materials sourced from other than sficertified forests we could incur substantial additional costs for operations and be required to reduce harvest levels 

what these regulations and certification programs mean to us 

the regulatory and nonregulatory forest management programs described above have 

 we believe that these kinds of programs have not had and in 2015  will not have a significant effect on the total harvest of timber in the united states or canada however these kinds of programs may have such an effect in the future we expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these programs as compared with typical owners of comparable timberlands we also expect that these programs will not significantly disrupt our planned operations over large areas or for extended periods 

canadian aboriginal rights 

many of the canadian timberlands are subject to the constitutionally protected treaty or commonlaw rights of aboriginal peoples of canada most of british columbia bc is not covered by treaties and as a result the claims of bc’s aboriginal peoples relating to forest resources have been largely unresolved on june 26 2014 the supreme court of canada ruled that the tsilhqot’in nation holds aboriginal title to approximately 1900 square kilometers in bc this was the first time that the court has declared title to exist based on historical occupation by aboriginal peoples many aboriginal groups continue to be engaged in treaty discussions with the governments of bc other provinces and canada 

final or interim resolution of claims brought by aboriginal groups can be expected to result in 

 we believe that such claims will not have a significant effect on our total harvest of timber or production of forest products in 2015  although they may have such an effect in the future in 2008 fpac of which we are a member signed a memorandum of understanding with the assembly of first nations under which the parties agree to work together to strengthen canada ’ s forest sector through economicdevelopment initiatives and business investments strong environmental stewardship and the creation of skilldevelopment opportunities particularly targeted to aboriginal youth 

pollutioncontrol regulations 

our operations are subject to various laws and regulations including 

 these laws and regulations as well as market demands impose controls with regard to 

 compliance with these laws regulations and demands usually involves capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs we cannot easily quantify the future amounts of capital expenditures we might have to make to comply with these laws regulations and demands or the effects on our operating costs because in some instances compliance standards have not been developed or have not become final or definitive in addition it is difficult to isolate the environmental component of most manufacturing capital projects 

  weyerhaeuser company  2014 annual report and form 10k   18 

our capital projects typically are designed to 

 we had no material capital expenditures relating primarily to environmental compliance in 2014  based on our understanding of current regulatory requirements in the us and canada we expect approximately 23 million of capital expenditures relating primarily to environmental compliance in 2015  

environmental cleanup 

we are involved in the environmental investigation or remediation of numerous sites of these sites 

 our liability with respect to these various sites ranges from insignificant to substantial the amount of liability depends on 

 we spent approximately 5 million  in 2014  and expect to spend approximately 7 million in 2015  on environmental remediation of these sites 

it is our policy to accrue for environmentalremediation costs when we 

 we currently believe it is reasonably possible that our costs to remediate all the identified sites may exceed our current accruals of 29 million  the excess amounts required may be insignificant or could range in the aggregate up to 138 million over several years this estimate of the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs is much less certain than the estimates we currently are using to determine how much to accrue the estimate of the upper range also uses assumptions less favorable to us among the range of reasonably possible outcomes

the united states environmental protection agency epa has promulgated regulations for air emissions from 

 these regulations cover 

 in 2011 and 2013 epa issued new mact standards for industrial boilers and process heaters in 2012 epa completed a technology and residual risk review for mact standards applicable to pulping and bleaching operations at pulp and paper manufacturing facilities in 2014 epa issued a revised new source performance standard for kraft pulp mills these latter two rules apply on a project specific basis when certain thresholds are exceeded as a result we cannot predict whether or when those rules may have a material impact on future projects regarding other recent final actions by the epa we expect to spend 23 million in 2015 to comply with mact standards 

the epa must still promulgate 

 we cannot currently quantify the amount of capital we will need in the future to comply with new regulations being developed by the epa because final rules have not been promulgated 

in 2010 epa issued a final greenhouse gas rule limiting the growth of emissions from new projects meeting certain thresholds on june 23 2014 the us supreme court issued a decision that removed potential applicability of the underlying 2010 regulations based solely on greenhouse gas emissions and limited application of the rule’s technology requirements to larger emission sources as a result of new emissions from nongreenhouse gas pollutants as a result of this supreme court ruling epa is expected to issue new guidance to set thresholds for when the greenhouse gas technology requirements apply if the nongreenhouse gas emissions trigger the rule in the first instance the impact of the supreme court ruling is to end the potential applicability of the technology requirements for our smaller manufacturing operations and limit the applicability for our other operations 

in june 2014 epa proposed an extensive regulatory program for existing electric utility generating units to scale back emissions of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide co2 arising from fossil fuel use to generate electricity this regulatory program potentially will have indirect impacts on our operations such as from rising purchased electricity prices or from secondary regulation of cogeneration units that we operate we are evaluating the proposal but are not able to predict whether the regulations when final and implemented will have a material impact on our operations 

we use significant biomass for energy production at our mills epa is currently working on rules regarding regulation of biomass emissions 

the impact of these greenhouse gas and biomass rules as well as recent court decisions on our operations remains uncertain 

  weyerhaeuser company  2014 annual report and form 10k   19 

to address concerns about greenhouse gases as a pollutant we 

 additional factors that could affect greenhouse gas emissions in the future include 

 we believe these developments have not had and in 2015  will not have a significant effect on our operations although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations we maintain an active forestry research program to track and understand any potential effect from actual climate change related parameters that could affect the forests we own and manage and do not anticipate any disruptions to our planned operations 

regulation of air emissions in canada 

in addition to existing provincial air quality regulations the canadian federal government has proposed an air quality management system aqms as a comprehensive national approach for improving air quality in canada the federal proposed aqms includes 

 environment canada is developing a “ greenhouse gas emission framework ”  that is expected to be proposed in 2015 with implementation in 2020 the framework will put in place a national sectorbased greenhouse gas reduction program applicable to a number of industries including pulp and paper manufacturing 

all canadian provincial governments 

 in addition british columbia has adopted a carbon tax and alberta has a mandatory ghg emission reduction regulation our grande prairie alberta cellulose fiber mill generates and sells carbon credits 

we believe these measures have not had and in 2015  will not have a significant effect on our operations although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations we also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations 

regulation of air emissions in poland and uruguay 

the european union ’ s “ clean air programme ”  includes new air quality objectives that poland and other european union countries will implement through 2030 some provinces in uruguay have established air quality monitoring networks and ambient air objectives have been proposed for the region where our los piques mill is located 

we believe these measures have not had and in 2015  will not have a significant effect on our operations although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations we also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations  

regulation of water 

in the us as a result of litigation under the federal clean water act   additional federal or state permits are now required in some states for the application of pesticides including herbicides on timberlands those permits have entailed additional costs in addition there is continuing litigation in the federal courts that may result in permit requirements for pollution discharges from forest roads and other drainage features on timberland which would entail additional costs for forest landowners including weyerhaeuser finally the federal regulatory agencies are considering expanding the definition of waters subject to federal clean water act jurisdiction which could increase the scope and number of permits required for forestryrelated activities and entail additional costs for weyerhaeuser and other forest landowners in the us 

in august 2014 epa issued a final regulation on thermal cooling water intakes for the protection of aquatic resources the final rule is not expected to have a material impact although the technology requirements to protect aquatic resources outlined in the rule may be applied on a casebycase when water permits are renewed 

in 2015 washington state department of ecology wa doe is expected to propose rules to update the human health water quality criteria for the protection of human health it is unclear what effect if any the wa doe regulations will have on our manufacturing operations in washington state 

  weyerhaeuser company  2014 annual report and form 10k   20 

in addition 

 we believe the above developments have not had and in 2015 will not have a significant effect on our operations although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations we also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations 

potential changes in pollution regulation 

state governments continue to promulgate total maximum daily load tmdl requirements for pollutants in water bodies that do not meet state or epa water quality standards state tmdl requirements may 

 it is not possible to estimate the capital expenditures that may be required for us to meet pollution allocations across the various proposed state tmdl programs until a specific tmdl is promulgated 

in canada various levels of government have been working to address water issues including use quality and management recent areas of focus include water allocation regional watershed protection protection of drinking water water pricing and a national water quality index

risk factors 

we are subject to various risks and events that could adversely affect our business our financial condition our results of operations and the price of our common stock 

you should consider the following risk factors in addition to the information presented elsewhere in this report particularly in “ forwardlooking statements ” and  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as in the filings we make from time to time with the sec in evaluating us our business and an investment in our securities 

the risks discussed below are not the only risks we face additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely affect our business 



macroeconomic conditions 

the industries in which we operate are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions and consequently are highly cyclical 

the overall levels of demand for the products we manufacture and distribute reflect fluctuations in levels of enduser demand which consequently impact our sales and profitability enduser demand depends in part on general macroeconomic conditions both in the us and globally as well as on local economic conditions current economic conditions in the united states reflect growth at or below historical trends and general business uncertainty but improving confidence global economic conditions reflect issues such as inflation and slowing growth in emerging countries the construction and homebuilding industries continue to slowly recover from the severe downturn caused by the overall collapse of credit markets and recession of 2009 however the recovery has been uneven and construction activity remains below prerecession and trend levels our wood products segment is highly dependent on the strength of the homebuilding industry although recovering the decline in home construction activity over the past several years resulted in depressed prices of and demand for wood products and building materials this resulted in lower prices and demand for logs and several years of reduced harvests in our timberlands segment the length and magnitude of industry cycles vary over time and by product but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions and levels of industry capacity those conditions have improved recently for some sectors but if macroeconomic conditions do not continue to improve we could experience lower sales volumes and smaller margins 

commodity products 

many of our products are commodities that are widely available from other producers 

because commodity products have few distinguishing properties from producer to producer competition for these products is based primarily on price which is determined by supply relative to demand and competition from substitute products in addition prices for our products are affected by many other factors outside of our control as a result we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes which often are volatile our profitability with respect to these products depends in part on managing our costs particularly raw material and energy costs which represent significant components of our operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control both sales and profitability of our products are subject to volatility due to market forces beyond our control 

industry supply of logs wood products and pulp 

excess supply of products may adversely affect prices and margins 

oversupply of products may result from producers introducing new capacity for manufactured products or increasing harvest levels in response to favorable shortterm pricing trends industry supplies of pulp are also influenced by global production capacity which has grown in recent years and is expected to continue to grow continuation of these factors could adversely affect our sales volumes and margins 

homebuilding market and economic risks 

high unemployment low demand and low levels of consumer confidence can adversely affect our business and results of operations 

several of our businesses are dependent upon the health of the us housing market demand for homes is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as the level of employment consumer confidence consumer income the availability of financing and interest rate levels the legacy of the housing bubble its collapse and ensuing credit crisis has been one of tightened credit requirements and a reduced number of mortgage loans available for financing home purchases credit conditions have begun to ease but remain significantly more restrictive than prior to the housing bubble demand for new homes also has been adversely affected by factors such as unemployment and lower job participation limited wage growth and weak consumer confidence additionally rising student loan debt among younger adults is limiting access to mortgage financing and home ownership foreclosure rates and distress sales of houses while still at elevated levels have fallen significantly and are less of an impact compared to the years immediately following the housing collapse 

homebuyers’ ability to qualify for and obtain affordable mortgages could be affected by changes in government sponsored entities and private mortgage insurance companies supporting the mortgage market 

the federal government has historically had a significant role in supporting mortgage lending through its sponsorship of fannie mae and freddie mac as a result of turbulence in credit markets and the mortgage finance industry in the last few years the effect of the federal government ’ s conservatorship of these government sponsored entities on the shortterm and longterm demand for new housing remains unclear   the liquidity provided to the mortgage industry by fannie mae and freddie mac both of which purchase home mortgages and mortgagebacked securities originated by mortgage lenders is critical to the housing market there have been significant concerns about the future purpose of fannie mae and freddie mac and a number of proposals to curtail their activities over time are under review limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these entities could adversely affect interest rates and the availability of mortgage financing which could reduce demand for housing and adversely affect demand for our products 

  weyerhaeuser company  2014 annual report and form 10k   23 

changes in mortgage interest expense and real estate tax regulations could harm our future sales and earnings 

significant costs of homeownership include mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes both of which are generally deductible for an individual ’ s federal and in some cases state income taxes any changes to income tax laws by the federal government or a state government to eliminate or substantially reduce these income tax deductions as has been considered from time to time would increase the aftertax cost of owning a home increases in real estate taxes by local governmental authorities would also increase the cost of homeownership any such increases to the cost of homeownership could adversely affect the demand for our products 

capital markets 

deterioration in economic conditions and the credit markets could adversely affect our access to capital 

upset financial or credit market conditions can impair the company ’ s ability to borrow money or otherwise access credit markets on terms acceptable to us which may among other impacts reduce our ability to take advantage of growth and expansion opportunities similarly our customers may be unable to borrow money to fund their operations similarly deteriorating or volatile market conditions could have an adverse effect on our customers and suppliers and their ability to purchase our products or sell products to us 

changes in credit ratings 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results actions that we take their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing the company on a watch list for possible future downgrading downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading could limit our access to the credit markets increase our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

substitution 

some of our products are vulnerable to declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials 

our products may compete with nonfiberbased alternatives or with alternative products in certain market segments for example plastic woodplastic or composite materials may be used by builders as alternatives to the products produced by our wood products businesses such as lumber veneer plywood and oriented strand board changes in prices for oil chemicals and woodbased fiber can change the competitive position of our products relative to available alternatives and could increase substitution of those products for our products if use of these alternative products grows demand for and pricing of our products could be adversely affected 

changes in product mix or pricing 

our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by changes in product mix or pricing 

our results may be adversely affected by a change in our product mix or pricing if we are not successful in implementing previously announced or future price increases or in our plans to increase sales of higherpriced highervalue products or if there are delays in acceptance of price increases or failure of customers to accept higherpriced products our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected price discounting if required to maintain our competitive position could result in lower than anticipated price realizations 

intense competition 

we face intense competition in our markets and the failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we compete with north american and for many of our product lines global producers some of which may have greater financial resources and lower production costs than we do the principal basis for competition for many of our products is selling price our ability to maintain satisfactory margins depends in large part on our ability to control our costs our industries also are particularly sensitive to other factors including innovation design quality and service with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line to the extent that one or more of our competitors become more successful with respect to any key competitive factor our ability to attract and retain customers could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to compete effectively such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

another emerging form of competition is between brands of sustainably produced products customer demand for certain brands could reduce competition among buyers for our products or cause other adverse effects 

in north america our forests are third partycertified to the sustainable forestry initiative sfi ®  standard some of our customers have expressed a preference in certain of our product lines for products made from raw materials sourced from forests certified to different standards including standards of the forest stewardship council fsc if and to the extent that preference for a standard other than sfi ® becomes a customer requirement there may be reduced demand and lower prices for our products relative to competitors who can supply products sourced from forests certified to competing certification standards if we seek to comply with such other standards we could incur materially increased costs for our operations or be required to reduce harvest levels fsc in particular employs standards that are geographically variable and could cause a material reduction in the harvest levels of some of our timberlands most notably in the pacific northwest 

  weyerhaeuser company  2014 annual report and form 10k   24 

material disruption of manufacturing 

a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales or negatively affect our results of operation and financial condition 

any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

 any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products or require us to make unplanned capital expenditures if one of our facilities or machines were to incur significant downtime our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired resulting in lower sales and income although some risks are not insurable and some coverage is limited we purchase insurance protecting our manufacturing facilities from fires floods windstorms earthquakes equipment failures and boiler explosions 

strategic initiatives 

our business and financial results may be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully execute on important strategic initiatives   

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results these strategic initiatives are designed to improve our results of operations and drive longterm shareholder value and include among others maximizing cash flow through operational excellence reducing costs to achieve industryleading cost structure and innovating in highermargin products  

capital requirements 

our operations require substantial capital 

our businesses require substantial capital for expansion and for repair or replacement of existing facilities or equipment although we maintain our production equipment with regular scheduled maintenance key pieces of equipment may need to be repaired or replaced periodically the costs of repairing or replacing such equipment and the associated downtime of the affected production line could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

while we believe our capital resources will be adequate to meet our current projected operating needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements if for any reason we are unable to provide for our operating needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements on acceptable economic terms we could experience a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

environmental laws and regulations 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with violations of or liabilities under applicable environmental laws and other laws and regulations 

we are subject to a wide range of general and industryspecific laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing 

 we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations and as a result of remedial obligations we also could incur substantial costs such as civil or criminal fines sanctions and enforcement actions including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions cleanup and closure costs and thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations 

as the owner and operator of real estate we may be liable under environmental laws for cleanup closure and other damages resulting from the presence and release of hazardous substances on or from our properties or operations in addition surface water management regulations may present liabilities and are subject to change the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict and in some cases our liability may exceed forecasted amounts or the value of the property itself the discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of 

  weyerhaeuser company  2014 annual report and form 10k   25 

additional cleanup obligations at our sites or thirdparty sites may result in significant additional costs any material liability we incur could adversely affect our financial condition or preclude us from making capital expenditures that otherwise would benefit our business 

we also anticipate public policy developments at the state federal and international level regarding climate change and energy access security and competitiveness we expect these developments to address emission of carbon dioxide renewable energy and fuel standards and the monetization of carbon compliance with regulations that implement new public policy in these areas might require significant expenditures these developments may also include mandated changes to energy use and building codes which could affect our homebuilding practices enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretation of these laws or regulations might require significant expenditures we also anticipate public policy developments at the state federal and international level regarding taxes and a number of other areas that could require significant expenditures 

changes in global or regional climate conditions and governmental response to such changes at the international us federal and state levels may affect our operations or our planned or future growth activities 

there continue to be numerous international us federal and statelevel initiatives and proposals to address domestic and global climate issues within the us some of these proposals would regulate andor tax the production of carbon dioxide and other “greenhouse gases” to facilitate the reduction of carbon compound emissions into the atmosphere and provide tax and other incentives to produce and use “cleaner” energy climate change impacts if they occur and governmental initiatives laws and regulations to address potential climate concerns could increase our costs and have a longterm adverse impact on our businesses and results of operations future legislation or regulatory activity in this area remains uncertain and its impact on our operations is unclear at this time however it is possible that legislation or government mandates standards or regulations intended to mitigate or reduce carbon compound or greenhouse gas emissions or other climate change impacts could adversely affect our operations for example such activities could limit harvest levels or result in significantly higher costs for energy and other raw materials because our manufacturing operations depend upon significant amounts of energy and raw materials these initiatives could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and profitability 

currency exchange rates 

we will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates 

we have manufacturing operations in canada poland and uruguay we are also a large exporter and compete with global producers of products very similar to ours therefore we are affected by changes in the strength of the us dollar particularly relative to the canadian dollar euro and yen and the strength of the euro relative to the yen changes in exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our sales volumes margins and results of operations 

availability of raw materials and energy 

our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials and energy 

we rely heavily on certain raw materials principally wood fiber and chemicals and energy sources principally natural gas electricity coal and fuel oil in our manufacturing processes our ability to increase earnings has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials and energy sources we may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material or energy costs through hedging arrangements price increases productivity improvements or costreduction programs 

people 

our business is dependent upon attracting retaining and developing key personnel 

we believe that our success depends to a significant extent upon our ability to attract retain and develop key senior management and operations management personnel our failure to recruit retain and develop key personnel could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

transportation 

we depend on third parties for transportation services and increases in costs and disruptions in the availability of transportation could materially adversely affect our business and operations 

our business depends on the transportation of a large number of products both domestically and internationally we rely primarily on third parties for transportation of the products we manufacture or distribute as well as delivery of our raw materials a significant portion of the goods we manufacture and raw materials we use are transported by marine rail and truck each of which is highly regulated in addition each has historically been subject to periodic disruption due to labor issues 

if any of our thirdparty transportation providers were to fail to deliver the goods we manufacture or distribute in a timely manner we may be unable to sell those products at full value or at all similarly if any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner we may be unable to manufacture our products in response to customer demand in addition if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us we may be unable to replace them at reasonable cost our thirdparty transportation providers are also subject to events outside of their control such as disruption of transportation infrastructure due to labor issues or natural disasters 

any failure of a thirdparty transportation provider to deliver raw materials or finished products in a timely manner could harm our reputation negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation 

in addition an increase in transportation rates or fuel surcharges could materially adversely affect our sales and profitability

reit status and tax implications 

if we fail to remain qualified as a reit our taxable income would be subject to tax at corporate rates and we would not be able to deduct dividends to shareholders 

in any taxable year in which we fail to qualify as a reit unless we are entitled to relief under the internal revenue code 

 qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code to our operations and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions although we operate in a manner consistent with the reit qualification rules we cannot assure you that we are or will remain so qualified 

certain of our business activities are subject to corporatelevel income tax and potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax 

under the internal revenue code reits generally must engage in the ownership and management of income producing real estate for the company this generally includes owning and managing a timberland portfolio for the production and sale of standing timber accordingly the harvesting and sale of logs the development or sale of certain timberlands and other real estate the manufacture and sale of wood products and the manufacture and sale of pulp products are conducted through one or more of our whollyowned taxable reit subsidiaries trss because such activities could generate nonqualifying reit income and could constitute “ prohibited transactions ”  prohibited transactions are defined by the internal revenue code generally to be sales or other dispositions of property to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business by conducting our business in this manner we believe that we satisfy the reit requirements of the internal revenue code and are not subject to the 100 percent tax that could be imposed if a reit were to conduct a prohibited transaction the net income of our trss is subject to corporatelevel income tax 

the extent of our use of our trs may affect the price of our common shares relative to the share price of other reits 

we conduct a significant portion of our business activities through one or more trss our use of our trss enables us to engage in nonreit qualifying business activities such as the sale of logs production and sale of wood products and pulp products and sale of hbu property our trss are subject to corporatelevel tax therefore we pay income taxes on the income generated by our trss under the code no more than 25 percent of the value of the gross assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trs this limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our trss ’  operations furthermore our use of trss may cause the market to value our common shares differently than the shares of other reits which may not use trss as extensively as we use them 

we may be limited in our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our taxable reit subsidiaries 

the ability of the reit to receive dividends from our trs is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a reit in particular at least 75 percent of gross income for each taxable year as a reit must be derived from passive real estate sources including sales of our standing timber and other types of qualifying real estate income and no more than 25 percent of our gross income may consist of dividends from our trs and other nonreal estate income 

this limitation on our ability to receive dividends from our trss may affect our ability to fund cash distributions to our shareholders using cash flows from our trss the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed and income that is not distributed will not be subject to the reit income distribution requirement 

our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate 

generally reits are required to distribute 90 percent of their ordinary taxable income and 95 percent of their net capital gains income capital gains may be retained by the reit but would be subject to income taxes if capital gains are retained rather than distributed our shareholders would be notified and they would be deemed to have received a taxable distribution with a refundable credit for any federal income tax paid by the reit accordingly we believe that we are not required to distribute material amounts of cash since substantially all of our taxable income is treated as capital gains income our board of directors in its sole discretion determines the amount of quarterly dividends to be provided to our shareholders based on consideration of a number of factors these factors include but are not limited to our results of operations cash flow and capital requirements economic conditions tax considerations borrowing capacity and other factors including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments future acquisitions and divestitures harvest levels changes in the price and demand for our products and general market demand for timberlands including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses consequently our dividend levels may fluctuate 

we may not be able to complete desired likekind exchange transactions for timberlands and real estate we sell 

when we sell timberlands and real estate we may seek to match these sales with the acquisition of suitable replacement timberlands this allows us “ likekind exchange ”  treatment for these transactions under section 1031 and related regulations of the code this matching of sales and purchases may provide us with tax benefits most importantly the deferral of builtin gains tax on the property sold the inability to obtain likekind exchange treatment may result in the payment of taxes with respect to the property sold and a corresponding reduction in earnings and cash available for distribution to shareholders as dividends 

changes in tax laws or their interpretation could adversely affect our shareholders and our results of operations 

federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process the internal revenue service the united states department of the treasury and state taxing authorities changes to tax laws could adversely affect our shareholders or increase our effective tax rates we cannot predict with certainty whether when in what forms or with what effective dates the tax laws applicable to us or our shareholders may be changed

legal proceedings 

see note 15 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for a summary of legal proceedings 

  weyerhaeuser company  2014 annual report and form 10k   29 




 

legal proceedings 

we are a party to a number of legal proceedings and adverse judgments in certain legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

the costs and other effects of pending litigation against us and related insurance recoveries cannot be determined with certainty although the disclosure in note 15 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies  of notes to consolidated financial statements  contains management ’ s current views of the effect such litigation will have on our financial results there can be no assurance that the outcome of such proceedings will be as expected 

it is possible that there could be adverse judgments against us in some or all major litigation against us and that we could be required to take a charge and make cash payments for all or a portion of any damage award any such charge or cash payment could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows for the quarter or year in which we record or pay it 

importexport taxes and duties 

we may be required to pay significant taxes on our exported products or countervailing and antidumping duties on our imported products 

international trade disputes occur frequently and can be taken to an international trade court for resolution of unfair trade practices between countries as an example there have been many disputes and subsequent trade agreements regarding sales of softwood lumber between canada and the united states the current softwood lumber agreement sla between canada and the us originally signed in october 2006 is scheduled to expire in october 2015 the sla requires canadian softwood lumber facilities including our mills to pay an export tax when the price of lumber is at or below a threshold price the export tax could be as high as 225 percent if a province exceeds its total allotted export share it is also possible that additional countervailing antidumping duties could be imposed in the future we may experience reduced revenues and margins in any business that is subject to such tariffs or to the terms of the settlements of such international disputes to the extent such tariffs increase prices they could also reduce the demand for our products these tariffs or settlement terms could have a material adverse effect on our business financial results and financial condition including facility closures or impairments of assets we cannot predict whether there will be an extension of the sla or a new agreement or if an extension or new agreement is completed its impact on our business 

natural disasters on timberlands assets 

our timberlands assets could be adversely affected by weather fire infestation or natural disasters 

our timberlands assets may be damaged by adverse weather severe wind and rainstorms fires pest infestation or other natural disasters because our manufacturing processes primarily use wood fiber in many cases from our own timberlands in the event of material damage to our timberlands our operations could be disrupted or our production costs could be increased as is typical in the forestry industry we do not insure against losses of timber including losses due to these causes 

acquisition of longview timber llc 

we may fail to realize the full benefits anticipated as a result of the acquisition of longview timber llc longview timber 

in 2013 we acquired longview timber there are a number of risks and uncertainties relating to the acquisition and the ultimate success of the acquisition will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities and growth prospects from combining our businesses with those of longview timber we may not fully realize our expected business opportunities and growth prospects we may need to make unanticipated capital expenditures or investments in order to maintain improve or sustain the operations or assets of longview timber we may be required to take writeoffs or impairment charges or recognize amortization expenses resulting from the acquisition and may be subject to unanticipated or unknown liabilities relating to longview timber and its business if any of these factors occur we may not fully realize our expected business opportunities and growth prospects 

tax distribution of wreco 

we could incur substantial us federal tax liability if the wreco transaction were found not to qualify as a taxfree “reorganization” or the distribution of wreco shares to weyerhaeuser shareholders were found not to qualify as a taxfree distribution 

in 2014 we closed the divestiture of our home building business weyerhaeuser real estate company wreco via a reverse morris trust transaction pursuant to which a wholly  owned subsidiary of tri pointe homes inc tri pointe merged with and into wreco with wreco surviving the merger and becoming a wholly  owned subsidiary of tri pointe the reverse morris trust transaction was structured to qualify as a taxfree reorganization and the associated distribution of wreco shares to weyerhaeuser shareholders as a taxfree distribution if the transaction were determined not to qualify as a taxfree reorganization   or if the distribution does not qualify as a taxfree distribution then weyerhaeuser or its subsidiaries or weyerhaeuser shareholders may be required to pay substantial us federal income taxes 

if the transaction were determined not to qualify as a taxfree reorganization or the distribution not to qualify as a taxfree distribution or if weyerhaeuser were required to indemnify tri pointe and wreco such taxes and indemnification obligations could be substantial and could materially and adversely affect the company’s liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

cybersecurity risks 

we rely on information technology to support our operations and reporting environments a security failure of that technology could impact our ability to operate our businesses effectively adversely affect our reported financial results impact our reputation and expose us to potential liability or litigation 

we use information systems to carry out our operational activities and maintain our business records some systems are internally managed and some are maintained by thirdparty service providers we and our service providers employ what we believe are adequate security measures our ability to conduct business could be materially and adversely affected if these systems or resources are compromised damaged or fail this could be a result of a cyber incident natural disaster hardware or software corruption failure or error telecommunications system failure service provider error or failure intentional or unintentional personnel actions or other disruption

stockprice volatility 

the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors some of which are beyond our control including those described above under  risks related to our industries and business  and the following 

 in addition there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in the forest products industry that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 

some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them if litigation of this type is brought against us it could result in substantial costs and divert management ’ s attention and resources 

preference shares 

our common shares will rank junior to our mandatory convertible preference shares with respect to dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation 

our common shares will rank junior to our mandatory convertible preference shares with respect to the payment of dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation dissolution or windingup this means that unless full cumulative dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding mandatory convertible preference shares for all past dividend periods and the then current dividend period no dividends may be declared or paid on our common shares likewise in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation dissolution or windingup no distribution of our assets may be made to holders of our common shares until we have paid to holders of the mandatory convertible preference shares a liquidation preference equal to 5000 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends 

certain provisions in the mandatory convertible preference shares could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover or takeover attempt of us and therefore the ability of holders to exercise their rights associated with a potential fundamental change 

certain provisions in our mandatory convertible preference shares could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us for example if a fundamental change were to occur on or prior to july 1 2016 holders of the mandatory convertible preference shares may have the right to convert their mandatory convertible preference shares in whole or in part at an increased conversion rate and be entitled to receive a fundamental change dividend makewhole amount equal to the present value of all remaining dividend payments on their mandatory convertible preference shares these features of the mandatory convertible preference shares could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management

our mda includes the following major sections 

 



the strength of the us housing market strongly affects our wood products and timberlands segments as published by the us census bureau total us housing starts for 2014 were slightly above 1000000 units with singlefamily units accounting for 648000 of the total this represents a 5 percent increase in singlefamily starts from 2013 which was 618000 units multifamily construction also increased in 2014 to 358000 units compared with 305000 in 2013 while a significant improvement current housing demand remains well below 1000000 singlefamily starts the lowest level during the 15year period of 19922007 

wood products primarily sells into the new residential building and repair and remodel markets demand for wood products has continued to modestly improve in 2014 resulting in prices similar to those in 2013 for most lumber and plywood products the significant exception was oriented strand board osb where 2014 prices were 31 percent below 2013 as measured by random lengths north central price 

demand for logs from our timberlands segment is affected by the production of woodbased building products as well as export demand in our western holdings in the south southern pine log prices were slightly higher in 2014 due to the modest improvement in the housing market while western log prices helped by demand from china and japan increased more substantially in 2014 

cellulose fibers is primarily affected by global supply and demand factors and the relative strength of the us dollar the severe winter weather in the first half of 2014 caused an inventory decline which took most of the year to correct consequently prices for cellulose fibers were higher in 2014 than 2013 the us dollar gained strength in 2014 as the euro declined 12 percent relative to the us dollar due to slowing growth in eurozone economies

critical accounting policies 

our critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and estimates they also have a high degree of complexity 

in accounting we base our judgments and estimates on 

 actual results however may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded 

our most critical accounting policies relate to our 

 details about our other significant accounting policies — what we use and how we estimate — are in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

pension and postretirement benefit plans   

we sponsor several pension and postretirement benefit plans for our employees key assumptions we use in accounting for the plans include our 

 at the end of every year we review our assumptions with external advisers and make adjustments as appropriate actual experience that differs from our assumptions or any changes in our assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

other factors that affect our accounting for the plans include 

 this section provides more information about our 

 expected longterm rate of return on plan assets 

plan assets are assets of the pension plan trusts that fund the benefits provided under the pension plans the expected longterm rate of return is our estimate of the longterm rate of return that our plan assets will earn our expected longterm rate of return is important in determining the net income or expense we recognize for our plans 

over the 30 years it has been in place our us pension trust investment strategy has achieved a 146 percent  net compound annual return rate 

after considering available information at the end of 2014  we continue to assume an expected longterm rate of return of 90 percent factors we considered include 

 our expected longterm rate of return is important in determining the net income or expense we recognize for our plans every 05 percent decrease in our expected longterm rate of return would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately 

 likewise every 05 percent increase in our expected longterm rate of return would decrease expense or increase a credit by those same amounts 

the actual return on plan assets in any given year may vary from our expected longterm rate of return actual returns on plan assets affect the funded status of the plans differences between actual returns on plan assets and the expected longterm rate of return are reflected as adjustments to cumulative other comprehensive income loss a component of total equity

discount rates 

our discount rates as of december 31 2014  are 

 we review our discount rates annually and revise them as needed the discount rates are selected at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of highquality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits 

pension and postretirement benefit expenses for 2015  will be based on the 41 percent  and 36 percent  assumed discount rates for us plans and 39 percent  and 38 percent  assumed discount rates for the canadian plans 

our discount rates are important in determining the cost of our plans a 05 percent decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately 

 likewise every 05 percent increase in our expected longterm rate of return would decrease expense or increase a credit by those same amounts 

longlived assets 

we review the carrying value of our longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations the carrying value is the amount assigned to longlived assets in our financial statements 

an impairment occurs when the carrying value of longlived assets will not be recovered from future cash flows and is more than fair market value fair market value is the estimated amount we would receive if we were to sell the assets 

in determining fair market value and whether impairment has occurred we are required to estimate 

 key assumptions we use in developing the estimates include 

 contingent liabilities 

we are subject to lawsuits investigations and other claims related to environmental product and other matters and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 

we record contingent liabilities when 

 assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors including 

 in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that an ultimate loss may occur 

while we do our best in developing our projections recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain if estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges in other income expense net these exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flow in any given quarter or year see note 15 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for more information

 detailed financial information about our business segments and our geographic locations is in note 2 business segments  and note 23 geographic areas  in the notes to consolidated financial statements   as well as in this section and in the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

effect of market conditions 

the health of the us housing market strongly affects our real estate wood products and timberlands segments real estate focuses on building single family homes wood products primarily sells into the new residential building and repair and remodel markets demand for logs from our timberlands segment is affected by the production of woodbased building products as well as export demand cellulose fibers is primarily affected by global demand and the relative strength of the us dollar 

  weyerhaeuser company  2013 annual report and form 10k   1 

competition in our markets 

we operate in highly competitive domestic and foreign markets with numerous companies selling similar products many of our products also face competition from substitutes for wood and woodfiber products in real estate development our competitors include numerous regional and national firms we compete in our markets primarily through price product quality an d service levels we are relentlessly focused on improving operational excellence to ensure a competitive cost structure and producing quality products customers want and are wiling to pay for 

our business segments’ competitive strategies are as follows 

 

sales outside the us 

in 2013  25 billion  — 29 percent  — of our total consolidated sales from continuing operations were to customers outside the us exports from the us increased 209 million or 12 percent primarily due to higher log export prices and volumes in our timberlands segment and higher pulp sales volumes in our cellulose fibers segment the table below shows sales outside the us for the last three years 



our employees 

we have approximately 13700  employees this number includes 

 of these employees approximately 3560 are members of unions covered by multiyear collectivebargaining agreements more information about these agreements is in note 10 pension and other postretirement benefit plans   in the notes to consolidated financial statements  



this section provides information about how we 

 for each of our business segments we provide details about what we do where we do it how much we sell and where we are headed 

timberlands 

our timberlands business segment manages 69 million  acres of private commercial forestland worldwide we own 62 million of those acres and have longterm leases on the other 07 million acres in addition we have renewable longterm licenses on 139 million  acres of forestland located in four canadian provinces the tables presented in this section include data from this segments business units as of the end of 2013  

what we do 

forestry management 

our timberlands business segment 

 our goal is to maximize returns by selling logs and stumpage to internal and external customers we focus on solid wood and use intensive silviculture to improve forest productivity and returns while managing our forests on a sustainable basis to meet customer and public expectations 

sustainable forestry practices 

we are committed to responsible environmental stewardship wherever we operate managing forests to produce financially mature timber while protecting the ecosystem services they provide our working forests include places with unique environmental cultural historical or recreational 

  weyerhaeuser company  2013 annual report and form 10k   2 

value to protect their unique qualities we follow regulatory requirements voluntary standards and implement the sustainable forestry initiative ®  sfi standard independent auditing of all of the forests we own or manage in the united states and canada certifies that we meet the sfi standard our forestlands in uruguay are forest stewardship council fsc certified or managed to the uruguayan national forestry management standard designed to meet the program for the endorsement of forest certification pefc 

canadian forestry operations 

in canada we have licenses to operate forestlands that provide raw material for our manufacturing units in various provinces when we harvest trees we pay the provinces at stumpage rates set by the government which generally are based on prevailing market prices we transfer logs to our manufacturing units at cost which means that we do not generate any profit in the timberlands segment from the harvest of timber from the licensed acres in canada 

other values from our timberlands 

in the united states we actively manage mineral oil and gas leases on our land and use geologic databases to identify and market opportunities for commercial mineral and geothermal development we recognize leasing revenue over the terms of agreements with customers revenue primarily comes from 

 in managing mineral resources we generate revenue related to our ownership of the minerals and separately related to our ownership of the surface the ownership of mineral rights and surface acres may be held by two separate parties materials that can be mined from the surface and whose value comes from factors other than their chemical composition typically belong to the surface owner examples of surface materials include rock sand gravel dirt and topsoil the mineral owner holds the title to commodities that derive value from their unique chemical composition examples of mineral rights include oil gas coal even if mined at the surface and precious metals if the two types of rights conflict then mineral rights generally are superior to surface rights a third type of land right is geothermal which can belong to either the surface or mineral owner we routinely reserve mineral and geothermal rights when selling surface timberlands acreage 

timberlands products 



how we measure our product 

we report timberlands data in cubic meters cubic meters measure the total volume of wood fiber in a tree or log that we can sell cubic meter volume is determined from the large and smallend diameters and length and provides a more consistent and comparative measure of timber and log volume among operating regions species size and seasons of the year than other units of measure 

we also use two other units of measure when transacting business including 

 both measures are accurate in the regions where they are used but they do not provide a meaningful basis for comparisons between the regions 

the conversion rate for mbf to cubic meters varies based on several factors including diameter length and taper of the timber the average conversion rate for mbf to cubic meters is approximately 67 cubic meters per mbf 

the conversion rate from green tons to cubic meters also varies based on the season harvested and the specific gravity of the wood for the region where the timber is grown an average conversion rate for green tons to cubic meters is approximately 0825 cubic meters per green ton 

where we do it 

our timberlands assets are located primarily in north america in the us we own and manage sustainable forests in nine states for use in wood products and pulp and paper manufacturing we own or lease 

 our international operations are located primarily in uruguay in uruguay we own 300000 acres and have longterm leases on 26000 acres in china we had a joint venture where we managed 44000 acres of timberland we sold our interest in this joint venture during 2012 

in addition we have renewable longterm licenses on 139 million  acres of forestland owned by the provincial government of four canadian provinces 

  weyerhaeuser company  2013 annual report and form 10k   3 

our total timber inventory — including timber on owned and leased land in our us and international operations — is approximately 334 million  cubic meters the timber inventory on licensed lands in canada is approximately 453 million  cubic meters the amount of timber inventory does not translate into an amount of lumber or panel products because the quantity of end products 

 the species size and grade of the trees affects the relative value of our timberlands 

we maintain our timber inventory in an integrated resource inventory and geographic information system “gis” the resource inventory component of the system is proprietary and is largely based on internally developed technologies including growth and yield models developed by our research and development organization the gis component is based on gis software that is viewed as the standard in our industry 

timber inventory data collection and verification techniques include the use of industry standard field sampling procedures as well as proprietary remote sensing technologies in some geographies where they generate improved estimates the data is collected and maintained at the timber stand level 

discussion of operations by geography 

summary of 2013  timber inventory and timberland locations 

united states 



we provide a constant year round flow of logs to internal and thirdparty customers we sell grade logs to mills that manufacture a diverse range of products including lumber plywood and veneer we also sell chips and fiber logs to pulp paper and oriented strand board mills our timberlands are well located to take advantage of road logging and transportation systems for efficient delivery of logs to these customers 

western united states 

our western acres are well situated to serve the wood product markets in oregon and washington in addition our location on the west coast provides access to highervalue export markets for douglas fir and whitewood logs in japan china and korea the size and quality of our western timberlands coupled with their proximity to several deepwater port facilities positions us to meet the needs of pacific rim log markets 

our lands are composed primarily of douglas fir a species highly valued for its structural strength our coastal lands also contain whitewood and have a higher proportion of whitewood than our interior holdings our management systems which provide us a competitive operating advantage range from research and forestry to technical planning models mechanized harvesting and marketing and logistics 

on july 23 2013 we purchased 100 percent of the equity interests in longview timber llc longview timber for 158 billion cash and assumed debt of 107 billion for an aggregate purchase price of 265 billion longview timber was a privatelyheld delaware limited liability company engaged in the ownership and management of approximately 645000 acres of timberlands in oregon and washington we believe longview timber has productive lands with favorable age class distribution that will provide us with optionality for harvest more information on this transaction can be found in note 3 longview timber purchase  in the notes to consolidated financial statements

2013  western us inventory by age  species 

the average age of timber harvested in 2013  was 53 years most of our us timberland is intensively managed for timber production but some areas are conserved for environmental historical recreational or cultural reasons some of our older trees are protected in acreage set aside for conservation and some are not yet logged due to harvest rate regulations while over the long term our average harvest age will decrease in accordance with our sustainable forestry practices we will only harvest approximately 15 percent of our western acreage each year 

southern united states 

our southern acres predominantly contain southern yellow pine and encompass timberlands in seven states 

we intensively manage our timber plantations using forestry research and planning systems to optimize grade log production we also actively manage our land to capture revenues from our oil gas and hard minerals resources we do this while providing quality habitat for a range of animals and birds which is in high demand for recreational purposes we lease more than 94 percent of our acres to the public and state wildlife agencies for recreational purposes 

2013  southern us inventory by species 

2013  southern us inventory by age  species 

the average age of timber harvested in 2013  was 32 years for southern yellow pine in accordance with our sustainable forestry practices we harvest approximately 30 percent to 35 percent of our acreage each year in the south 

  weyerhaeuser company  2013 annual report and form 10k   5 

international 



our forestland acres in uruguay are split approximately 50 percent loblolly pine and 50 percent eucalyptus loblolly pine comprises more of our timber inventory due to its older age on average the timber in uruguay is in the second third of its rotation age it is entering into that part of the growth rotation when we will see increased volume accretion about 95 percent of the area to be planted has been afforested to date 

2013  international inventory by species uruguay 

in uruguay the target rotation ages are 21 to 22 years for pine and 14 to 17 years for eucalyptus we manage both species to a grade appearance regime 

we also operate a plywood mill in uruguay with a production capacity of 210000 cubic meters production volume reached 192000 cubic meters in 2013  

in brazil weyerhaeuser is a managing partner in a joint venture we own 67 percent and fibria celulose sa owns 33 percent a hardwood sawmill with 55000 cubic meters of capacity produces highvalue eucalyptus lyptus ®  lumber and related appearance wood products the mill’s production in 2013  was 48500 cubic meters 

canada — licensed timberlands 



we lease and license forestland in canada from the provincial government to secure the volume for our manufacturing units in the various provinces when the volume is harvested we pay the province at stumpage rates set by the government and generally based on prevailing market prices the harvested logs are transferred to our manufacturing facilities at cost stumpage plus harvest haul and overhead costs less any margin on selling logs to third parties any conversion profit is recognized at the respective mill in either the cellulose fibers or wood products segment 

fiveyear summary of timberlands production 



our timberlands annual fee depletion represents the harvest of the timber assets we own depletion is a method of expensing the cost of establishing the fee timber asset base over the harvest or timber sales volume the increase in fee depletion from 2011 through 2013 reflects improving market conditions the increase in fee depletion in the west in 2013 also reflects the purchase of longview timber

we are subject to a multitude of laws and regulations in the operations of our businesses we also participate in voluntary certification of our timberlands to assure that we sustain their values including the protection of wildlife and water quality changes in law and regulation or certification processes can significantly affect our business 

regulations affecting forestry practices 

in the united states regulations established by federal state and local governments or agencies to protect water quality and wetlands could affect future harvests and forest management practices on some of our timberlands forest practice laws and regulations that affect present or future harvest and forest management activities in certain states include 

 each state in which we own timberlands has developed best management practices to reduce the effects of forest practices on water quality and aquatic habitats additional and more stringent regulations may be adopted by various state and local governments to achieve waterquality standards under the federal clean water act protect fish and wildlife habitats or achieve other public policy objectives 

in canada our forest operations are carried out on public forestlands under forest licenses with the provinces all forest operations are subject to 

    protect environmental values   and 

    encourage other stewardship values 

on may 18 2010 21 member companies of the forest products association of canada fpac including weyerhaeuser ’ s canadian subsidiary announced the signing of a canadian boreal forest agreement cbfa with nine environmental organizations the cbfa applies to approximately 72 million hectares of public forests licensed to fpac members and when fully implemented is expected to lead to the conservation of significant areas of canada ’ s boreal forest and protection of boreal species at risk in particular woodland caribou cbfa signatories continue to work on management plans with provincial governments and seek the participation of aboriginal and local communities in advancing the goals of the cbfa progress under the cbfa is measured and reported on by an independent auditor 

endangered species protections 

in the united states a number of fish and wildlife species that inhabit geographic areas near or within our timberlands have been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal endangered species act esa or similar state laws including 

 additional species or populations may be listed as threatened or endangered as a result of pending or future citizen petitions or petitions initiated by federal or state agencies in addition significant citizen litigation seeks to compel the federal agencies to designate critical habitat for esalisted species and many cases have resulted in settlements under which designations will be implemented over time such designations may adversely affect some management activities and options restrictions on timber harvests can result from 

 

such actions could increase our operating costs and affect timber supply and prices in general to date we do not believe that these measures have had and we do not believe that in 2014  they will have a significant effect on our harvesting operations we anticipate that likely future actions will not disproportionally affect weyerhaeuser as compared with comparable operations of us competitors 

in canada 

 identify critical habitat  and 

 

the identification and protection of habitat and the implementation of range plans and land use action plans may over time result in additional restrictions on timber harvests and other forest management practices that could increase operating costs for operators of forestlands in canada to date we do not believe that these canadian measures have had and we do not believe that in 2014  they will have a significant effect on our harvesting operations we anticipate that likely future measures will not disproportionally affect weyerhaeuser as compared with similar operations of canadian competitors 

  weyerhaeuser company  2013 annual report and form 10k   20 

forest certification standards 

we operate in north america under the sustainable forestry initiative sfi ®  this is a certification standard designed to supplement government regulatory programs with voluntary landowner initiatives to further protect certain public resources and values sfi ®  is an independent standard overseen by a governing board consisting of 

 ongoing compliance with sfi ®  may result in some increases in our operating costs and curtailment of our timber harvests in some areas there also is competition from other private certification systems primarily the forest stewardship council fsc coupled with efforts by supporters to further those systems by persuading customers of forest products to require products certified to their preferred system certain features of the fsc system could impose additional operating costs on timberland management because of the considerable variation in fsc standards and variability in how those standards are interpreted and applied if sufficient marketplace demand develops for products made from raw materials sourced from other than sficertified forests we could incur substantial additional costs for operations and be required to reduce harvest levels 

what these regulations and certification programs mean to us 

the regulatory and nonregulatory forest management programs described above have 

 we believe that these kinds of programs have not had and in 2014  will not have a significant effect on the total harvest of timber in the united states or canada however these kinds of programs may have such an effect in the future we expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these programs as compared with typical owners of comparable timberlands we also expect that these programs will not significantly disrupt our planned operations over large areas or for extended periods 

canadian aboriginal rights 

many of the canadian forestlands are subject to the constitutionally protected treaty or commonlaw rights of aboriginal peoples of canada most of british columbia bc is not covered by treaties and as a result the claims of bc ’ s aboriginal peoples relating to forest resources are 

largely unresolved although many aboriginal groups are engaged in treaty discussions with the governments of bc and canada 

final or interim resolution of claims brought by aboriginal groups is expected to result in 

 we believe that such claims will not have a significant effect on our total harvest of timber or production of forest products in 2014  although they may have such an effect in the future in 2008 fpac of which we are a member signed a memorandum of understanding with the assembly of first nations under which the parties agree to work together to strengthen canada ’ s forest sector through economicdevelopment initiatives and business investments strong environmental stewardship and the creation of skilldevelopment opportunities particularly targeted to aboriginal youth 

pollutioncontrol regulations 

our operations are subject to various laws and regulations including 

 these laws and regulations as well as market demands impose controls with regard to 

 compliance with these laws regulations and demands usually involves capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs we cannot easily quantify the future amounts of capital expenditures we might have to make to comply with these laws regulations and demands or the effects on our operating costs because in some instances compliance standards have not been developed or have not become final or definitive in addition it is difficult to isolate the environmental component of most manufacturing capital projects 

our capital projects typically are designed to 

   weyerhaeuser company  2013 annual report and form 10k   21 

we had no material capital expenditures relating primarily to environmental compliance in 2013  based on our understanding of current regulatory requirements in the us and canada we expect approximately 10 million of capital expenditures relating primarily to environmental compliance in 2014  

environmental cleanup 

we are involved in the environmental investigation or remediation of numerous sites of these sites 

 our liability with respect to these various sites ranges from insignificant to substantial the amount of liability depends on 

 we spent approximately 6 million  in 2013  and expect to spend approximately 6 million in 2014  on environmental remediation of these sites 

it is our policy to accrue for environmentalremediation costs when we 

 we currently believe it is reasonably possible that our costs to remediate all the identified sites may exceed our current accruals of 30 million  the excess amounts required may be insignificant or could range in the aggregate up to 101 million  over several years this estimate of the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs is much less certain than the estimates we currently are using to determine how much to accrue the estimate of the upper range also uses assumptions less favorable to us among the range of reasonably possible outcomes 

regulation of air emissions in the us 

the united states environmental protection agency epa had promulgated regulations for air emissions from 

 these regulations cover 

 in 2011 and 2013 epa issued new mact standards for industrial boilers and process heaters and in 2012 completed a technology and residual risk review for the mact standards applicable to pulping and bleaching operations at pulp and paper manufacturing facilities as a result of these recent final actions by the epa we expect we might spend as much as 25 million to 45 million over the next several years to comply with the mact standards 

the epa must still promulgate 

 we cannot currently quantify the amount of capital we will need in the future to comply with new regulations being developed by the epa because final rules have not been promulgated 

in 2007 the us supreme court ruled that greenhouse gases are pollutants that can be subject to regulation under the clean air act as a result the epa 

 the epa also issued a final rule deferring until mid2014 greenhouse gas permitting requirements for carbon dioxide emissions from biomass the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit vacated this rule in august 2013 however the court has withheld putting its decision into effect pending a decision in a us supreme court review of the 2010 greenhouse gas emissions rule referenced above the impacts of this decision are uncertain while the other litigation is unresolved and until epa issues the final rules regarding how biomass emissions will be regulated  

it is unclear what the effect of epa ’ s greenhouse gas regulations will be on our operations until final rules regarding biomass emissions are promulgated 

to address concerns about greenhouse gases as a pollutant we 

   weyerhaeuser company  2013 annual report and form 10k   22 

additional factors that could affect greenhouse gas emissions in the future include 

 it is not yet known when and to what extent these policy activities may come into force or how they may relate to each other in the future 

we believe these measures have not had and in 2014  will not have a significant effect on our operations although they may have such an effect in the future we expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with typical owners of comparable operations we maintain an active forestry research program to track and understand any potential effect from actual climate change related parameters that could affect the forests we own and manage and do not anticipate any disruptions to our planned operations 

regulation of air emissions in canada 

the canadian federal government has proposed an air quality management system aqms as a comprehensive approach for improving air quality in canada on october 11 2012 most canadian provincial and territorial jurisdictions agreed to begin implementing the aqms the federal proposed aqms includes 

 

environment canada is developing a “ greenhouse gas emission framework ”  that is expected to be proposed in 2015 with implementation in 2020 the framework will put in place a national sectorbased greenhouse gas reduction program applicable to a number of industries including pulp and paper manufacturing 

all canadian provincial governments 

 in addition british columbia has adopted a carbon tax and alberta has a mandatory ghg emission reduction regulation our grande prairie cellulose fiber mill generates and sells carbon credits 

we believe these measures have not had and in 2014  will not have a significant effect on our operations although they may have such an effect in the future we expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with typical owners of comparable operations we also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations 

regulation of air emissions in uruguay and poland 

the european union ’ s “ clean air programme ”  includes new air quality objectives that poland and other eu countries will implement over the coming years up through 2030 some provinces in uruguay have established air quality monitoring networks and ambient air objectives have been proposed for the region where our los piques mill is located 

we believe these measures have not had and in 2014 will not have a significant effect on our operations although they may have such an effect in the future we expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with typical owners of comparable operations we also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations  

regulation of water 

in the us as a result of litigation under the federal clean water act   additional federal or state permits are now required in some states for the application of pesticides including herbicides on forest lands those permits have entailed additional costs in addition there is continuing litigation in the federal courts that may result in permit requirements for pollution discharges from forest roads and other drainage features on forest land which would entail additional costs for forest landowners including weyerhaeuser finally the federal regulatory agencies are considering expanding the definition of waters subject to federal clean water act jurisdiction which could increase the scope and number of permits required for forestryrelated activities and entail additional costs for weyerhaeuser and other forest landowners in the us 

in 2014 the epa is expected to issue final regulations on water intakes for the protection of aquatic resources it is unclear what the effect if any of epa ’ s water intake regulations will be on our us pulp operations until final rules are promulgated 

in 2014 the washington state department of ecology wa doe is expected to propose rules to update the human health water quality criteria for the protection of human health it is unclear what the effect if any of the wa doe regulations will have on our manufacturing operations in washington state on november 25 2013 amendments to the canadian federal fisheries act came into force the amendments change the focus from habitat protection to fisheries protection and increase penalties uruguay’s national policy for water includes river basin planning management and water use permits wastewater discharge authorization is required for industry in response to an eu water framework directive poland is to develop by end of 2015 a water management plan for every river basin to reduce total nitrogen and phosphorous loads in municipal waste water by 75 percent 

  weyerhaeuser company  2013 annual report and form 10k   23 

potential changes in pollution regulation 

state governments continue to promulgate total maximum daily load tmdl requirements for pollutants in water bodies that do not meet state or epa water quality standards state tmdl requirements may 

 it is not possible to estimate the capital expenditures that may be required for us to meet pollution allocations across the various proposed state tmdl programs until a specific tmdl is promulgated 

in canada various levels of government have been working to address water issues including use quality and management recent areas of focus include water allocation regional watershed protection protection of drinking water water pricing and a national water quality index 

we established a goal in may 2008 to reduce water use at our cellulose fibers mills 20 percent by 2012 using a 2007 baseline we achieved a 19 percent water use reduction in 2012 compared to our 2007 baseline

risk factors 

we are subject to certain risks and events that if one or more of them occur could adversely affect our business our financial condition our results of operations and the trading price of our common stock 

you should consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information presented in this report and the matters described in “ forwardlooking statements ” as well as the other reports and registration statements we file from time to time with the sec in evaluating us our business and an investment in our securities 

the risks below are not the only risks we face additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely affect our business 



macroeconomic conditions 

the industries in which we operate are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions and consequently highly cyclical 

the overall levels of demand for the products we manufacture and distribute reflect fluctuations in levels of enduser demand which consequently impact our sales and profitability enduser demand depends in part on general macroeconomic conditions in north america and worldwide as well as on local economic conditions current economic conditions in the united states reflect growth below historical trends moderately improving consumer confidence and general business uncertainty fueled by fiscal concerns within the us as well as global economic issues such as slowing growth and rising inflation in emerging countries the homebuilding industry including our real estate business has recently experienced increased demand for new homes resulting in falling inventories which contributed to some improvement in selling prices for new and existing homes this improvement is highly dependent on continued improvement in the overall economy the relative health of which has been subject to the numerous shocks and obstacles including those mentioned earlier our wood products segment is highly dependent on the strength of the homebuilding industry the decline in home construction activity over the past several years which occurred as a result of the credit bubble and recession resulted in depressed prices of and demand for wood products and building materials this was reflected in lower prices and demand for logs and reduced harvests in our timberland segment the length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time and by product but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions those conditions improved recently for some sectors such as homebuilding and wood products while other sectors such as cellulose fibers have been adversely impacted by the slowdown in global economic growth as this is a major driver of demand for products made from cellulose fibers 

commodity products 

many of our products are commodities that are widely available from other producers 

because commodity products have few distinguishing properties from producer to producer competition for these products is based primarily on price which is determined by supply relative to demand and competition from substitute products prices for our products are affected by many factors outside of our control and we have no influence over the timing and extent of price changes which often are volatile our profitability with respect to these products depends in part on managing our costs particularly raw material and energy costs which represent significant components of our operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control prices of and demand for many of our products have fluctuated significantly in recent quarters while many of our raw material or energy costs have increased as a result both sales and profitability are subject to volatility due to market forces beyond our control 

industry supply of logs wood products and pulp 

excess supply of products may adversely affect prices and margins 

oversupply of products also may result from producers introducing new capacity or increasing harvest levels in response to favorable shortterm pricing trends industry supplies of pulp also are influenced by overseas production capacity which has grown in recent years and is expected to continue to grow while the weakness of the us dollar in recent years has improved the company ’ s competitive position the recent strengthening of the us dollar and decreases in demand for consumer products in emerging markets may result in lower prices continuation of these factors could materially and adversely affect sales volumes and margins of our operations 

homebuilding market and economic risks 

high unemployment low demand and low levels of consumer confidence can adversely affect our business and results of operations 

many of our businesses are dependent upon the health of the us housing market demand for homes is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as the level of employment consumer confidence consumer income the availability of financing and interest rate levels the legacy of the housing bubble its collapse and ensuing credit crisis has been one of tightened credit requirements and a reduced number of mortgage loans available for financing home purchases credit conditions have begun to ease but remain significantly more restrictive than prior to the housing bubble demand for new homes also has been adversely affected by factors such as continued high unemployment and weak consumer confidence additionally rising student loan debt among younger adults is limiting access to mortgage financing and home ownership foreclosure rates and distress sales of houses while still at elevated levels have fallen and are less of an impact compared to the years immediately following the housing collapse 

homebuyers ’  ability to qualify for and obtain affordable mortgages could be affected by changes in government sponsored entities and private mortgage insurance companies supporting the mortgage market 

the federal government has historically had a significant role in supporting mortgage lending through its sponsorship of fannie mae and freddie mac as a result of turbulence in the credit markets and mortgage finance industry in the last few years the effect of the federal government ’ s conservatorship of these government sponsored entities on the shortterm and longterm demand for new housing remains unclear   the liquidity provided to the mortgage industry by fannie mae and freddie mac both of which purchase home mortgages and mortgagebacked securities originated by mortgage lenders is critical to the housing market there have been significant concerns about the future purpose of fannie mae and freddie mac and a number of proposals to curtail their activities over time are under review any limitations or restrictions on the availability 

  weyerhaeuser company  2013 annual report and form 10k   26 

of financing by these entities could adversely affect interest rates mortgage financing and increase the effective cost of our homes which could reduce demand for our homes and adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in mortgage interest expense and real estate tax regulations could harm our future sales and earnings 

significant costs of homeownership include mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes both of which are generally deductible for an individual ’ s federal and in some cases state income taxes any changes to income tax laws by the federal government or a state government to eliminate or substantially reduce these income tax deductions as has been considered from time to time would increase the aftertax cost of owning a home increases in real estate taxes by local governmental authorities also increase the cost of homeownership any such increases to the cost of homeownership could adversely affect the demand for and sales prices of new homes 

capital markets 

deterioration in economic conditions and the credit markets could adversely affect our access to capital 

upset financial or credit market conditions can impair the company ’ s ability to borrow money or otherwise access credit markets on terms acceptable to us which may among other impacts reduce our ability to take advantage of growth and expansion opportunities similarly our customers may be unable to borrow money to fund their operations similarly deteriorating or volatile market conditions could have an adverse effect on our customers and suppliers and their ability to purchase our products or sell products to us 

changes in credit ratings 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results actions that we take their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing the company on a watch list for possible future downgrading downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading could limit our access to the credit markets increase our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

substitution 

some of our products are vulnerable to declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials 

our products may compete with nonfiberbased alternatives or with alternative products in certain market segments for example plastic woodplastic or composite materials may be used by builders as alternatives to the products produced by our wood products businesses such as lumber veneer plywood and oriented strand board changes in prices for oil chemicals and woodbased fiber can change the competitive position of our products relative to available alternatives and could increase substitution of those products for our products as the use of these alternatives grows demand for our products may further decline 

changes in product mix or pricing 

our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by changes in product mix or pricing 

our results may be adversely affected by a change in our product mix or pricing if we are not successful in implementing previously announced or future price increases or plans to move customers to higherpriced products or if there are delays in acceptance of price increases or failure of customers to accept higherpriced products our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected moreover price discounting if required to maintain our competitive position could result in lower than anticipated price realizations 

intense competition 

we face intense competition in our markets and the failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we compete with north american and for many of our product lines global producers some of which may have greater financial resources and lower production costs than we do the principal basis for competition for many of our products is selling price our ability to maintain satisfactory margins depends in large part on our ability to control our costs our industries also are particularly sensitive to other factors including innovation design quality and service with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line to the extent that one or more of our competitors become more successful with respect to any key competitive factor our ability to attract and retain customers could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to compete effectively such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

another emerging form of competition is between brands of sustainably produced products customer demand for certain brands could reduce competition among buyers for our products or cause other adverse effects 

in north america our forests are third partycertified to the sustainable forestry initiative sfi ®  standard some of our customers have expressed a preference in certain of our product lines for products made from raw materials sourced from forests certified to different standards including standards of the forest stewardship council fsc if and to the extent that this preference becomes a customer requirement there may be reduced demand and lower prices for our products relative to competitors who can supply products sourced from forests certified to competing certification standards if we seek to comply with such other standards we could incur materially increased costs for our operations or be required to reduce harvest levels fsc in particular employs standards that are geographically variable and could cause a material reduction in the harvest levels of some of our timberlands most notably in the pacific northwest 

  weyerhaeuser company  2013 annual report and form 10k   27 

material disruption of manufacturing 

a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales or negatively affect our results of operation and financial condition 

any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

 any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products or require us to make unplanned capital expenditures if one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired resulting in lower sales and income 

strategic initiatives 

our business and financial results may be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully execute on important strategic initiatives 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results these strategic initiatives are designed to improve our results of operations and drive longterm shareholder value and include among others maximizing cash flow through operational excellence reducing costs to achieve industryleading cost structure and innovating in highermargin products  

capital requirements 

our operations require substantial capital 

the company has substantial capital requirements for expansion and repair or replacement of existing facilities or equipment although we maintain our production equipment with regular scheduled maintenance key pieces of equipment may need to be repaired or replaced periodically the costs of repairing or replacing such equipment and the associated downtime of the affected production line could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we believe our capital resources will be adequate to meet our current projected operating needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements if for any reason we are unable to provide for our operating needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements on economic terms we could experience a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

environmental laws and regulations 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with violations of or liabilities under applicable environmental laws and other laws and regulations 

we are subject to a wide range of general and industryspecific laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing 

 for example the us environmental protection agency epa is in the process of implementing final rules regulating greenhouse gases that apply to our operations on a projectbyproject basis and may be applied to carbon dioxide emissions from biomass these and similar laws and regulations in the us and canada will require us to obtain authorizations from and comply with the authorization requirements of the appropriate governmental authorities which have considerable discretion over the terms and timing of permits 

we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations and as a result of remedial obligations we also could incur substantial costs such as civil or criminal fines sanctions and enforcement actions including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions cleanup and closure costs and thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations 

as the owner and operator of real estate including in our homebuilding business we may be liable under environmental laws for cleanup closure and other damages resulting from the presence and release of hazardous substances on or from our properties or operations in 

  weyerhaeuser company  2013 annual report and form 10k   28 

addition surface water management regulations may present liabilities and are subject to change the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict and in some cases our liability may exceed forecasted amounts or the value of the property itself the discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at our sites or thirdparty sites may result in significant additional costs any material liability we incur could adversely affect our financial condition or preclude us from making capital expenditures that otherwise would benefit our business 

we also anticipate public policy developments at the state federal and international level regarding climate change and energy access security and competitiveness we expect these developments to address emission of carbon dioxide renewable energy and fuel standards and the monetization of carbon compliance with regulations that implement new public policy in these areas might require significant expenditures these developments may also include mandated changes to energy use and building codes which could affect our homebuilding practices enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretation of these laws or regulations might require significant expenditures we also anticipate public policy developments at the state federal and international level regarding taxes health care and a number of other areas that could require significant expenditures 

currency exchange rates 

we will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates 

we have manufacturing operations in canada poland uruguay and brazil we are also a large exporter and compete with producers of products very similar to ours therefore we are affected by changes in the strength of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar euro and yen and the strength of the euro relative to the yen 

availability of raw materials and energy 

our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials and energy 

we rely heavily on certain raw materials principally wood fiber and chemicals and energy sources principally natural gas electricity coal and fuel oil in our manufacturing processes our ability to increase earnings has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials and energy sources we may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material or energy costs through hedging arrangements price increases productivity improvements or costreduction programs 

people 

our business is dependent upon attracting retaining and developing key personnel 

we believe that our success depends to a significant extent upon our ability to attract retain and develop key senior management and operations management personnel our failure to recruit retain and develop these key personnel could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

transportation 

we depend on third parties for transportation services and increases in costs and the availability of transportation could materially adversely affect our business and operations 

our business depends on the transportation of a large number of products both domestically and internationally we rely primarily on third parties for transportation of the products we manufacture or distribute as well as delivery of our raw materials in particular a significant portion of the goods we manufacture and raw materials we use are transported by railroad or trucks which are highly regulated 

if any of our thirdparty transportation providers were to fail to deliver the goods we manufacture or distribute in a timely manner we may be unable to sell those products at full value or at all similarly if any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner we may be unable to manufacture our products in response to customer demand in addition if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us we may be unable to replace them at reasonable cost 

any failure of a thirdparty transportation provider to deliver raw materials or finished products in a timely manner could harm our reputation negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation 

in addition an increase in transportation rates or fuel surcharges could materially adversely affect our sales and profitability 

reit status and tax implications 

if we fail to remain qualified as a reit our taxable income would be subject to tax at corporate rates and we would not be able to deduct dividends to shareholders 

in any taxable year in which we fail to qualify as a reit unless we are entitled to relief under the internal revenue code 

 qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code to our operations and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions although we operate in a manner consistent with the reit qualification rules we cannot assure you that we are or will remain so qualified 

in addition federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process the internal revenue service the united states department of the treasury and state taxing authorities changes to the tax law could adversely affect our shareholders we cannot predict with certainty whether when in what forms or with what effective dates the tax laws applicable to us or our shareholders may be changed 

  weyerhaeuser company  2013 annual report and form 10k   29 

certain of our business activities are subject to corporatelevel income tax and potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax  

under the internal revenue code reits generally must engage in the ownership and management of income producing real estate for the company this generally includes owning and managing a timberland portfolio for the production and sale of standing timber accordingly the manufacture and sale by us of wood products the harvesting and sale of logs and the development or sale of certain timberlands the manufacture and sale of pulp products the development of real estate the building and sale of singlefamily houses and the development and sale of land and lots for real estate development are conducted through one or more of our whollyowned taxable reit subsidiaries trss because such activities could generate nonqualifying reit income and could constitute “ prohibited transactions ”  prohibited transactions are defined by the internal revenue code generally to be sales or other dispositions of property to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business by conducting our business in this manner we believe that we satisfy the reit requirements of the internal revenue code and are not subject to the 100 percent tax that could be imposed if a reit were to conduct a prohibited transaction the net income of our trss is subject to corporatelevel income tax 

the extent of our use of our trs may affect the price of our common shares relative to the share price of other reits 

we conduct a significant portion of our business activities through one or more trss our use of our trss enables us to engage in nonreit qualifying business activities such as the sale of logs production and sale of wood products and pulp products real estate development and singlefamily home sales and sale of hbu property our trss are subject to corporatelevel tax therefore we pay income taxes on the income generated by our trss under the code no more than 25 percent of the value of the gross assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trs this limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our trss ’  operations furthermore our use of trss may cause the market to value our common shares differently than the shares of other reits which may not use trss as extensively as we use them 

we may be limited in our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our taxable reit subsidiaries 

the ability of the reit to receive dividends from our trs is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a reit in particular at least 75 percent of gross income for each taxable year as a reit must be derived from passive real estate sources including sales of our standing timber and other types of qualifying real estate income and no more than 25 percent of our gross income may consist of dividends from our trs and other nonreal estate income 

this limitation on our ability to receive dividends from our trss may affect our ability to fund cash distributions to our shareholders using cash flows from our trss the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed and income that is not distributed will not be subject to the reit income distribution requirement 

our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate 

generally reits are required to distribute 90 percent of their ordinary taxable income and 95 percent of their net capital gains income capital gains may be retained by the reit but would be subject to income taxes if capital gains are retained rather than distributed our shareholders would be notified and they would be deemed to have received a taxable distribution with a refundable credit for any federal income tax paid by the reit accordingly we believe that we are not required to distribute material amounts of cash since substantially all of our taxable income is treated as capital gains income our board of directors in its sole discretion determines the amount of quarterly dividends to be provided to our shareholders based on consideration of a number of factors these factors include but are not limited to our results of operations cash flow and capital requirements economic conditions tax considerations borrowing capacity and other factors including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments future acquisitions and divestitures harvest levels changes in the price and demand for our products and general market demand for timberlands including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses consequently our dividend levels may fluctuate 

we may not be able to complete desired likekind exchange transactions for timberlands and real estate we sell 

when we sell timberlands and real estate we generally seek to match these sales with the acquisition of suitable replacement timberlands this allows us “ likekind exchange ”  treatment for these transactions under section 1031 and related regulations of the code this matching of sales and purchases provides us with significant tax benefits most importantly the deferral of any gain on the property sold until ultimate disposition of the replacement property while we attempt to complete likekind exchanges wherever practical we may not be able to do so in all instances due to various factors including the lack of availability of suitable replacement property on acceptable terms and our inability to complete a qualifying likekind exchange transaction within the time frames required by the code the inability to obtain likekind exchange treatment would result in the payment of taxes with respect to the property sold and a corresponding reduction in earnings and cash available for distribution to shareholders as dividends

  weyerhaeuser company  2013 annual report and form 10k   32 




 legal proceedings 

we are a party to a number of legal proceedings and adverse judgments in certain legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

the costs and other effects of pending litigation against us and related insurance recoveries cannot be determined with certainty although the disclosure in note 17 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies  of notes to consolidated financial statements  contains management ’ s current views of the effect such litigation will have on our financial results there can be no assurance that the outcome of such proceedings will be as expected 

it is possible that there could be adverse judgments against us in some or all major litigation against us and that we could be required to take a charge and make cash payments for all or a portion of any damage award any such charge or cash payment could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows for the quarter or year in which we record or pay it 

  weyerhaeuser company  2013 annual report and form 10k   30 

export taxes 

we may be required to pay significant export taxes or countervailing and antidumping duties for exported products 

we may experience reduced revenues and margins on some of our businesses as a result of export taxes or countervailing and antidumping duty assessments international trade disputes occur frequently and can be taken to an international trade court for resolution of unfair trade practices between countries for example there have been many disputes and subsequent trade agreements regarding sales of softwood lumber between canada and the united states the current softwood lumber act signed in october 2006 requires our canadian softwood lumber facilities to pay an export tax when the price of lumber is at or below a threshold price the export tax could be as high as 225   percent if a province exceeds its total allotted export share it is possible that additional countervailing duty and antidumping tariffs or similar type tariffs could be imposed on us in the future we may experience reduced revenues and margins in any business that is subject to such tariffs or to the terms of the settlements of such international disputes these tariffs or settlement terms could have a material adverse effect on our business financial results and financial condition including facility closures or impairments of assets 

natural disasters 

our business and operations could be adversely affected by weather fire infestation or natural disasters 

our timberlands assets may be damaged by adverse weather severe wind and rainstorms fires pest infestation or other natural disasters because our manufacturing processes primarily use wood fiber in many cases from our own timberlands in the event of material damage to our timberlands our operations could be disrupted or our production costs could be increased as is typical in the forestry industry we do not insure against losses of timber including losses due to these causes 

acquisition of longview timber llc 

we may fail to realize the full benefits anticipated as a result of the acquisition of longview timber llc 

there are a number of risks and uncertainties relating to our recent acquisition of longview timber llc the ultimate success of the acquisition will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities and growth prospects from combining our businesses with those of longview timber we may not fully realize our expected business opportunities synergies and growth prospects integrating operations may require significant efforts and expenditures from us we may also be required to make unanticipated capital expenditures or investments in order to maintain improve or sustain the operations or assets of longview timber or take writeoffs or impairment charges or recognize amortization expenses resulting from the acquisition and may be subject to unanticipated or unknown liabilities relating to longview timber and its business if any of these factors limit our ability to fully integrate the businesses successfully or on a timely basis the expectations of future results of operations following the acquisition might not be met 

real estate transaction

stockprice volatility 

the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors some of which are beyond our control including those described above under  risks related to our industries and business  and the following 

 in addition there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in the forest products industry that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 

some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them if litigation of this type is brought against us it could result in substantial costs and would divert management ’ s attention and resources

preference shares 

our common shares will rank junior to our mandatory convertible preference shares with respect to dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation 

our common shares will rank junior to our mandatory convertible preference shares with respect to the payment of dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation dissolution or windingup this means that unless full cumulative dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding mandatory convertible preference shares for all past dividend periods and the then current dividend period no dividends may be declared or paid on our common shares likewise in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation dissolution or windingup no distribution of our assets may be made to holders of our common shares until we have paid to holders of the mandatory convertible preference shares a liquidation preference equal to 5000 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends 

certain provisions in the mandatory convertible preference shares could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover or takeover attempt of us and therefore the ability of holders to exercise their rights associated with a potential fundamental change 

certain provisions in our mandatory convertible preference shares could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us for example if a fundamental change were to occur on or prior to july 1 2016 holders of the mandatory convertible preference shares may have the right to convert their mandatory convertible preference shares in whole or in part at an increased conversion rate and will also be entitled to receive a fundamental change dividend makewhole amount equal to the present value of all remaining dividend payments on their mandatory convertible preference shares these features of the mandatory convertible preference shares could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management

our mda includes the following major sections 

 



in 2013 the us economy continued to advance at a sluggish pace growth in the us economy was hindered by fiscal issues which included the fiscal cliff sequestration and a budget impasse which caused a partial shutdown of the government for 16 days private sector growth was an area of comparative strength but not without incident   as hints of tapering of the federal reserve asset purchases caused an abrupt rise in interest rates which rattled markets these factors significantly affected the economy limiting anticipated improvements in key economic indicators the us housing market while affected by these factors continued to show signs of improvement in 2013 as lower inventories of new and existing homes led to increases in new home construction and rises in home values the strength of the us housing market strongly affects our real estate wood products and timberlands segments 

real estate focuses on building singlefamily homes as published by the us census bureau total us housing starts for 2013 were 923 thousand units with single family units accounting for 618 thousand of the total this represents a 15 percent increase in single family starts from 2012 which was 535 thousand units multifamily construction also increased in 2013 to 305 thousand units compared with 246 thousand in 2012 while a significant improvement current housing demand remains well below 1 million or more single family starts the typical level during the 15year period of 19922007 in 2013 new home sales in the us averaged 430 thousand units this level represents a 17 percent increase over 2012 

wood products primarily sells into the new residential building and repair and remodel markets demand for wood products has continued to improve as housing starts have increased this has resulted in higher prices than those observed in 2012 prices for most commodity wood products were higher in 2013 with the greatest increases observed in douglas fir lumber and oriented strand board osb higher prices led to improved industry operating rates for lumber and osb despite the improvement demand for both lumber and panels remain below peak levels 

demand for logs from our timberlands segment is affected by the production of woodbased building products as well as export demand in the south several years of deferred harvest due to weak demand have created increased inventories and as a result southern pine log prices were modestly higher in 2013 while western log prices helped by resurgent demand from china and japan increased more substantially in 2013 

cellulose fibers is primarily affected by global demand and the relative strength of the us dollar the us dollar was relatively stable compared to most global currencies during 2013 with some notable exceptions the volatility which characterized the euro in 2012 was mostly absent in 2013 the us dollar weakened slightly against the euro for much of 2013 which improved our pulp mills competitiveness against competitors with euro denominated costs and had a positive effect on cellulose fibers pricing demand in the key global economies of europe and china improved from 2012

critical accounting policies 

our critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and estimates they also have a high degree of complexity 

in accounting we base our judgments and estimates on 

 actual results however may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded 

our most critical accounting policies relate to our 

 details about our other significant accounting policies — what we use and how we estimate — are in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

pension and postretirement benefit plans 

we sponsor several pension and postretirement benefit plans for our employees key assumptions we use in accounting for the plans include our 

 at the end of every year we review our assumptions with external advisers and make adjustments as appropriate actual experience that differs from our assumptions or any changes in our assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

other factors that affect our accounting for the plans include 

 this section provides more information about our 

 expected longterm rate of return 

plan assets are assets of the pension plan trusts that fund the benefits provided under the pension plans the expected longterm rate of return is our estimate of the longterm rate of return that our plan assets will earn our expected longterm rate of return is important in determining the net income or expense we recognize for our plans 

over the 29 years it has been in place our us pension trust investment strategy has achieved a 148 percent  net compound annual return rate 

after considering available information at the end of 2013  we continue to assume an expected longterm rate of return of 90 percent factors we considered include 

   weyerhaeuser company  2013 annual report and form 10k   49 

our expected longterm rate of return is important in determining the net income or expense we recognize for our plans every 05 percent decrease in our expected longterm rate of return would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately 

 likewise every 05 percent increase in our expected longterm rate of return would decrease expense or increase a credit by those same amounts 

the actual return on plan assets in any given year may vary from our expected longterm rate of return actual returns on plan assets affect the funded status of the plans differences between actual returns on plan assets and the expected longterm rate of return are reflected as adjustments to cumulative other comprehensive income loss a component of total equity 

discount rates 

our discount rates as of december 31 2013  are 

 we review our discount rates annually and revise them as needed the discount rates are selected at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of highquality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits 

pension and postretirement benefit expenses for 2014  will be based on the 49 percent  and 40 percent  assumed discount rates for us plans and 47 percent  and 46 percent  assumed discount rates for the canadian plans 

our discount rates are important in determining the cost of our plans a 05 percent decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately 

 longlived assets 

we review the carrying value of our longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations the carrying value is the amount assigned to longlived assets in our financial statements 

an impairment occurs when the carrying value of longlived assets will not be recovered from future cash flows and is more than fair market value fair market value is the estimated amount we would receive if we were to sell the assets 

in determining fair market value and whether impairment has occurred we are required to estimate 

 key assumptions we use in developing the estimates include 

 impairment of longlived assets real estate 

we review homebuilding longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 

real estate in process of development and land being processed for development 

real estate in process of development and land being processed for development includes subdivisions and master planned communities mpcs mpcs typically include several product segments such as residential active adult retail and commercial we evaluate impairment at the subdivision or mpc product segment level factors that are considered when evaluating a subdivision or mpc product segment for impairment include 

 we update the undiscounted cash flow forecast for each subdivision and mpc product segment that may be impaired the undiscounted cash flow forecasts are affected by communityspecific factors that include 

   weyerhaeuser company  2013 annual report and form 10k   50 

the carrying amount of each subdivision and mpc product segment is written down to fair value when the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of a subdivision or mpc product segment an impairment charge for a subdivision or mpc product segment is allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot 

real estate for sale 

real estate for sale includes homes that have been completed and land that we intend to sell we regularly sell land or lots that do not fit our value proposition or development plans 

the carrying amount of real estate for sale is reduced to fair value less estimated costs to sell if the forecasted net proceeds are less than the carrying amount the fair value analysis is affected by local market economic conditions demographic factors and competitor actions and is inherently uncertain actual net proceeds can differ from the estimates the carrying amount of real estate for sale is evaluated quarterly 

market approach 

we use the market approach to determine fair value of real estate assets when information for comparable assets is available this approach is commonly used for completed inventory and individual assets for sale we typically use 

 income approach 

we generally use the income approach to determine fair value of real estate for our inactive projects and assets in process of development the income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example cash flows or earnings to a single present amount discounted the fair value measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations regarding those future estimated cash inflows and outflows we use present value techniques based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams the income approach relies on management judgment regarding the various inputs to the undiscounted cash flow forecasts 

contingent liabilities 

we are subject to lawsuits investigations and other claims related to environmental product and other matters and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 

we record contingent liabilities when 

 assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors including 

 in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that an ultimate loss may occur 

while we do our best in developing our projections recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain if estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges in other income expense net these exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flow in any given quarter or year see note 15 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for more information 

prospective accounting pronouncements 

currently there are no significant prospective accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a material impact on us

  weyerhaeuser company  2012 annual report and form 10k   1 

competition in our markets 

we operate in highly competitive domestic and foreign markets with numerous companies selling similar products many of our products also face competition from substitutes for wood and woodfiber products in real estate development our competitors include numerous regional and national firms we compete in our markets primarily through price product quality and service levels 

our business segments’ competitive strategies are as follows 

 

sales outside the us 

in 2012  21 billion  — 30 percent  — of our total consolidated sales and revenues from continuing operations were to customers outside the us exports from the us decreased 93 million or 5 percent primarily due to lower pulp price realizations in our cellulose fibers segment the table below shows sales outside the us for the last three years 



our employees 

we have approximately 13200  employees this number includes 

 of these employees approximately 3500 are members of unions covered by multiyear collectivebargaining agreements more information about these agreements is in note 8 pension and other postretirement benefit plans  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  



this section provides information about how we 

 for each of our business segments we provide details about what we do where we do it how much we sell and where we are headed 

timberlands 

our timberlands business segment manages 63 million acres of private commercial forestland worldwide we own 56 million of those acres and have longterm leases on the other 07 million acres in addition we have renewable longterm licenses on 139 million acres of forestland located in four canadian provinces the tables presented in this section include data from this segments business units as of the end of 2012  

what we do 

forestry management 

our timberlands business segment 

 our goal is to maximize returns by selling logs and stumpage to internal and external customers we focus on solid wood and use intensive silviculture to improve forest productivity and returns while managing our forests on a sustainable basis to meet customer and public expectations 

  weyerhaeuser company  2012 annual report and form 10k   2 

sustainable forestry practices 

we are committed to responsible environmental stewardship wherever we operate managing forests to produce financially mature timber while protecting the ecosystem services they provide our working forests include places with unique environmental cultural historical or recreational value to protect their unique qualities we follow regulatory requirements voluntary standards and implement the sustainable forestry initiative ®  sfi standard independent auditing of all of the forests we own or manage in the united states and canada certifies that we meet the sfi standard our forestlands in uruguay are forest stewardship council fsc certified or managed to the uruguayan national forestry management standard designed to meet the program for the endorsement of forest certification pefc 

canadian forestry operations 

in canada we have licenses to operate forestlands that provide raw material for our manufacturing units in various provinces when we harvest trees we pay the provinces at stumpage rates set by the government which generally are based on prevailing market prices we transfer logs to our manufacturing units at cost which means that we do not generate any profit in the timberlands segment from the harvest of timber from the licensed acres in canada 

other values from our timberlands 

in the united states we actively manage mineral oil and gas leases on our land and use geologic databases to identify and market opportunities for commercial mineral and geothermal development we recognize leasing revenue over the terms of agreements with customers revenue primarily comes from 

 in managing mineral resources we generate revenue related to our ownership of the minerals and separately related to our ownership of the surface the ownership of mineral rights and surface acres may be held by two separate parties materials that can be mined from the surface and whose value comes from factors other than their chemical composition typically belong to the surface owner examples of surface materials include rock sand gravel dirt and topsoil the mineral owner holds the title to commodities that derive value from their unique chemical composition examples of mineral rights include oil gas coal even if mined at the surface and precious metals if the two types of rights conflict then mineral rights generally are superior to surface rights a third type of land right is geothermal which can belong to either the surface or mineral owner we routinely reserve mineral and geothermal rights when selling surface timberlands acreage 

timberlands products 



how we measure our product 

we report timberlands data in cubic meters cubic meters measure the total volume of wood fiber in a tree or log that we can sell cubic meter volume is determined from the large and smallend diameters and length and provides a more consistent and comparative measure of timber and log volume among operating regions species size and seasons of the year than other units of measure 

we also use two other units of measure when transacting business including 

 both measures are accurate in the regions where they are used but they do not provide a meaningful basis for comparisons between the regions 

the conversion rate for mbf to cubic meters varies based on several factors including diameter length and taper of the timber the average conversion rate for mbf to cubic meters is approximately 67 cubic meters per mbf 

the conversion rate from green tons to cubic meters also varies based on the season harvested and the specific gravity of the wood for the region where the timber is grown an average conversion rate for green tons to cubic meters is approximately 0825 cubic meters per green ton 

where we do it 

our timberlands assets are located primarily in north america in the us we own and manage sustainable forests in nine states for use in wood products and pulp and paper manufacturing we own or lease 

 our international operations are located primarily in uruguay in uruguay we own 300000 acres and have longterm leases on 26000 acres in china we had a joint venture where we manged 44000 acres of timberland we sold our interest in this joint venture during 2012 

  weyerhaeuser company  2012 annual report and form 10k   3 

in addition we have renewable longterm licenses on 139 million acres of forestland owned by the provincial government of four canadian provinces 

our total timber inventory — including timber on owned and leased land in our us and international operations — is approximately 300 million cubic meters the timber inventory on licensed lands in canada is approximately 443 million cubic meters the amount of timber inventory does not translate into an amount of lumber or panel products because the quantity of end products 

 the species size and grade of the trees affects the relative value of our timberlands 

we maintain our timber inventory in an integrated resource inventory and geographic information system “gis” the resource inventory component of the system is proprietary and is largely based on internally developed technologies including growth and yield models developed by our research and development organization the gis component is based on gis software that is viewed as the standard in our industry 

timber inventory data collection and verification techniques include the use of industry standard field sampling procedures as well as proprietary remote sensing technologies in some geographies where they generate improved estimates the data is collected and maintained at the timber stand level

summary of 2012  timber inventory and timberland locations 

united states 



western united states 

our western acres are well situated to serve the wood product markets in oregon and washington their location near weyerhaeuser mills and many thirdparty facilities allows for multiple sales opportunities in addition our location on the west coast provides access to highervalue export markets for douglas fir and whitewood logs in japan korea and china the size and quality of our western timberlands coupled with their proximity to several deepwater port facilities positions us to meet the needs of pacific rim log markets 

our lands are composed primarily of douglas fir a species highly valued for its structural strength our coastal lands also contain whitewood and have a higher proportion of whitewood than our interior holdings our management systems which provide us a competitive operating advantage range from research and forestry to technical planning models mechanized harvesting and marketing and logistics

2012 western us inventory by age  species 

the average age of timber harvested in 2012  was 51 years most of our us timberland is intensively managed for timber production but some areas are conserved for environmental historical recreational or cultural reasons some of our older trees are protected in acreage set aside for conservation and some are not yet logged due to harvest rate regulations while over the long term our average harvest age will decrease in accordance with our sustainable forestry practices we will only harvest approximately 15 percent of our western acreage each year 

southern united states 

our southern acres predominantly contain southern yellow pine and encompass timberlands in seven states this area provides a constant year round flow of logs to a variety of internal and thirdparty customers we sell grade logs to mills that manufacture a diverse range of products including lumber plywood and veneer we also sell chips and fiber logs to oriented strand board pulp and paper mills our timberlands are well located to take advantage of road logging and transportation systems for efficient delivery of logs to these customers 

we intensively manage our timber plantations using forestry research and planning systems to optimize grade log production we also actively manage our land to capture revenues from our oil gas and hard minerals resources we do this while providing quality habitat for a range of animals and birds which is in high demand for recreational purposes we lease more than 95 percent of our acres to the public and state wildlife agencies for recreational purposes 

2012 southern us inventory by species 

2012 southern us inventory by age  species 

the average age of timber harvested in 2012  was 32 years for southern yellow pine in accordance with our sustainable forestry practices we harvest approximately 30 percent to 35 percent of our acreage each year in the south 

  weyerhaeuser company  2012 annual report and form 10k   5 

international 



our forestlands in uruguay are approximately 51 percent loblolly pine and 49 percent eucalyptus on a hectare basis on average the timber in uruguay is in the first third of its rotation age it is entering into that part of the growth rotation when we will see increased volume accretion about 95 percent of the area to be planted has been afforested to date 

2012 international inventory by species uruguay 

in uruguay the target rotation ages are 21 to 22 years for pine and 14 to 17 years for eucalyptus we manage both species to a grade appearance regime 

we also operate a plywood mill in uruguay with a production capacity of 210000 cubic meters and a production volume of 200000 cubic meters reached in 2012  

in brazil weyerhaeuser is a managing partner in a joint venture we own 67 percent and fibria celulose sa owns 33 percent a hardwood sawmill with 65000 cubic meters of capacity produces highvalue eucalyptus lyptus ®  lumber and related appearance wood products the mill’s production in 2012  was 49600 cubic meters 

canada — licensed timberlands 



we lease and license forestland in canada from the provincial government to secure the volume for our manufacturing units in the various provinces when the volume is harvested we pay the province at stumpage rates set by the government and generally based on prevailing market prices the harvested logs are transferred to our manufacturing facilities at cost stumpage plus harvest haul and overhead costs less any margin on selling logs to third parties any conversion profit is recognized at the respective mill in either the cellulose fibers or wood products segment

our timberlands annual fee depletion represents the harvest of the timber assets we own depletion is a method of expensing the cost of establishing the fee timber asset base over the harvest or timber sales volume the decline in fee depletion from 2008 through 2010 reflects the company’s decision to defer harvest and preserve the longterm value of the assets as well as two major dispositions in the west

 we sell three grades of logs — domestic grade domestic fiber and export factors that may affect log sales in each of these categories include 

 our sales volumes include logs purchased in the open market and all our domestic and export logs that are sold to unaffiliated customers or transferred at market prices to our internal mills by the sales and marketing staff within our timberlands business units

fiveyear summary of published domestic log prices 2 sawlog bark on — mbf 

fiveyear summary of export log prices 2 sawlog bark on — mbf 

our log prices are affected by the supply of and demand for grade and fiber logs and are influenced by the same factors that affect log sales export log prices are particularly affected by the japanese housing market 

our average 2012  log realizations in the west decreased from 2011  — primarily due to lower demand for logs in the chinese market and an increase in log supply in the domestic market our average 2012  log realizations in the south increased slightly from 2011  — primarily due to stronger demand for logs in the south 

minerals and energy products 

mineral revenue decreased in 2012  as recognition of leasing revenue from old leases in the haynesville shale trend was completed and low natural gas prices limited the sales of producing gas properties this decline was partially offset by increased leasing activity in new areas and royalty received from production of oil in the tuscaloosa marine shale trend earnings from construction aggregates and industrial minerals decreased slightly

many social values are expressed in the laws and regulations that pertain to growing and harvesting timber we participate in voluntary certification of our timberlands to assure that we sustain their values including the protection of wildlife and water quality we are also subject to laws regulating forestry practices changes in law and regulation can significantly affect local or regional timber harvest levels production costs and market values of timberbased raw materials 

regulations affecting forestry practices 

in the united states regulations established by federal state and local governments or agencies to protect water quality and wetlands could affect future harvests and forest management practices on some of our timberlands forest practice acts in some states in the united states that affect present or future harvest and forest management activities include 

 each state in which we own timberlands has developed best management practices to reduce the effects of forest practices on water quality and aquatic habitats additional and more stringent regulations may be adopted by various state and local governments to achieve waterquality standards under the federal clean water act protect fish and wildlife habitats or achieve other public policy objectives 

in canada our forest operations are carried out on public forestlands under forest licenses with the provinces all forest operations are subject to 

 –   protect environmental values and 

–  encourage other stewardship values 

on may 18 2010 21 member companies of the forest products association of canada fpac including weyerhaeuser’s canadian subsidiary announced the signing of a canadian boreal forest agreement cbfa with nine environmental organizations the cbfa applies to approximately 72 million hectares of public forests licensed to fpac members and when fully implemented is expected to lead to the conservation of significant areas of canada’s boreal forest and protection of woodland caribou cbfa signatories continue to work on management plans to be proposed to provincial governments and to communicate with aboriginal and local communities to seek their participation in advancing the goals of the cbfa progress under the cbfa is measured by an independent auditor 

  

endangered species protections 

in the united states a number of fish and wildlife species that inhabit geographic areas near or within our timberlands have been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal endangered species act esa or similar state laws including 

 additional species or populations may be listed as threatened or endangered as a result of pending or future citizen petitions or petitions initiated by federal or state agencies in addition significant citizen litigation seeks to compel the federal agencies to designate critical habitat for esalisted species and many cases have resulted in settlements under which designations will be implemented over time such designations may adversely affect some management activities and options restrictions on timber harvests can result from 

 such actions could increase our operating costs and affect timber supply and prices in general to date these measures have not had and in 2013 will not have a significant effect on our harvesting operations we anticipate that likely future actions will not disproportionally affect weyerhaeuser as compared with comparable operations of us competitors 

in canada 

 identify critical habitat 

 the identification and protection of habitat may over time result in additional restrictions on timber harvests and other forest management practices that could increase operating costs for operators of forestlands in canada to date these canadian measures have not had and in 2013  will not have a significant effect on our harvesting operations we anticipate that likely future measures will not disproportionally affect weyerhaeuser as compared with similar operations of canadian competitors 

forest certification standards 

we operate in north america under the sustainable forestry initiative sfi ®  this is a certification standard designed to supplement government regulatory programs with voluntary landowner initiatives to further protect certain public resources and values sfi ®  is an independent standard overseen by a governing board consisting of 

   weyerhaeuser company  2012 annual report and form 10k   18 

 ongoing compliance with sfi ®  may result in some increases in our operating costs and curtailment of our timber harvests in some areas there also is competition from other private certification systems primarily the forest stewardship council fsc coupled with efforts by supporters to further those systems by persuading customers of forest products to require products certified to their preferred system certain features of the fsc system could impose additional operating costs on timberland management because of the considerable geographic variation in fsc standards and variability in how those standards are interpreted and applied if sufficient marketplace demand develops for products made from raw materials sourced from other than sfi certified forests we could incur additional costs for operations and be required to reduce harvest levels 

what these regulations and certification programs mean to us 

the regulatory and nonregulatory forest management programs described above have 

 we believe that these kinds of programs have not had and in 2013  will not have a significant effect on the total harvest of timber in the united states or canada however these kinds of programs may have such an effect in the future we expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these programs as compared with typical owners of comparable timberlands we also expect that these programs will not significantly disrupt our planned operations over large areas or for extended periods 

canadian aboriginal rights 

many of the canadian forestlands are subject to the constitutionally protected treaty or commonlaw rights of aboriginal peoples of canada most 

of british columbia bc is not covered by treaties and as a result the claims of bc’s aboriginal peoples relating to forest resources are 

largely unresolved although many aboriginal groups are engaged in treaty discussions with the governments of bc and canada 

final or interim resolution of claims brought by aboriginal groups is expected to result in 

 we believe that such claims will not have a significant effect on our total harvest of timber or production of forest products in 2013  although they 

may have such an effect in the future in 2008 fpac of which we are a member signed a memorandum of understanding with the assembly of 

first nations under which the parties agree to work together to strengthen canada’s forest sector through economicdevelopment initiatives and 

business investments strong environmental stewardship and the creation of skilldevelopment opportunities particularly targeted to aboriginal 

youth 

pollutioncontrol regulations 

our operations are subject to various laws and regulations including 

 these laws and regulations as well as market demands impose controls with regard to 

 compliance with these laws regulations and demands usually involves capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs we cannot easily quantify the future amounts of capital expenditures we might have to make to comply with these laws regulations and demands or the effects on our operating costs because in some instances compliance standards have not been developed or have not become final or definitive in addition it is difficult to isolate the environmental component of most manufacturing capital projects 

our capital projects typically are designed to 

 we estimate that we had no capital expenditures made primarily for environmental compliance in 2012  based on our understanding of current regulatory requirements in the us and canada we expect no material capital expenditures for environmental compliance in 2013  

  weyerhaeuser company  2012 annual report and form 10k   19 

environmental cleanup 

we are involved in the environmental investigation or remediation of numerous sites of these sites 

 our liability with respect to these various sites ranges from insignificant to substantial the amount of liability depends on 

 we spent approximately 6 million  in 2012  and expect to spend approximately 6 million in 2013  on environmental remediation of these sites 

it is our policy to accrue for environmentalremediation costs when we 

 we currently believe it is reasonably possible that our costs to remediate all the identified sites may exceed our current accruals of 32 million  the excess amounts required may be insignificant or could range in the aggregate up to 95 million  over several years this estimate of the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs is much less certain than the estimates we currently are using to determine how much to accrue the estimate of the upper range also uses assumptions less favorable to us among the range of reasonably possible outcomes 

regulation of air emissions in the us 

the united states environmental protection agency epa had promulgated regulations for air emissions from 

 these regulations cover 

 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit issued decisions in 2007 

 in 2012 epa issued new mact standards for industrial boilers and process heaters and completed a technology and residual risk review for the mact standards applicable to pulping and bleaching operations at pulp and paper manufacturing facilities as a result of these recent final actions by the epa we expect we might spend as much as 25 million to 45 million over the next few years to comply with the mact standards 

the epa must still promulgate 

 we cannot currently quantify the amount of capital we will need in the future to comply with new regulations being developed by the epa or canadian environmental agencies because final rules have not been promulgated 

in 2007 the us supreme court ruled that greenhouse gases are pollutants that can be subject to regulation under the clean air act as a result the epa 

 it is unclear what the effect of epa’s greenhouse gas regulations will be on our operations until final rules regarding biomass emissions are promulgated 

to address concerns about greenhouse gases as a pollutant we 

 additional factors that could affect greenhouse gas emissions in the future include 

   weyerhaeuser company  2012 annual report and form 10k   20 

it is not yet known when and to what extent these policy activities may come into force or how they may relate to each other in the future 

we believe these measures have not had and in 2013  will not have a significant effect on our operations although they may have such an effect in the future we expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with typical owners of comparable operations we maintain an active forestry research program to track and understand any potential effect from actual climate change related parameters that could affect the forests we own and manage and do not anticipate any disruptions to our planned operations 

regulation of air emissions in canada 

in canada 

 measuring reporting and managing greenhouse gas emissions and protecting air quality 

the canadian federal government 

 environment canada is moving forward with a sectorbased approach for ghg reduction and is currently working with provincial regulatory authorities to try to harmonize with their regulations 

all canadian provincial governments 

 we believe these measures have not had and in 2013  will not have a significant effect on our operations although they may have such an effect in the future we expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with typical owners of comparable operations we also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations 

regulation of water 

in the us as a result of litigation some of which is ongoing additional federal or state permits will be required in the future 

under the federal clean water act in one or more of the states in which we operate these permits relate to 

 such permits some of which became effective in early 2012 will entail additional costs for weyerhaeuser and some other forest landowners 

in canada in 2011 a national round table on the environment and the economy nrtee proposed changes to wateruse management across canada and recommended that federal provincial and territorial governments develop new water strategies nrtee has convened experts from across canada to develop a national action plan on how to effectively implement the reports recommendations recommendations if adopted by the federal government may entail additional costs however we do not expect a disproportionate effect on weyerhaeuser as compared to comparable operations of other forest landowners in june 2012 the federal government announced that nrtees funding will end in 2013 

potential changes in pollution regulation 

state governments continue to promulgate total maximum daily load tmdl requirements for pollutants in water bodies that do not meet state 

or epa water quality standards state tmdl requirements may 

 amounts of pollutants 

it is not possible to estimate the capital expenditures that may be required for us to meet pollution allocations across the various proposed state 

tmdl programs until a specific tmdl is promulgated 

in canada various levels of government have started work to address water usage and quality issues regional watershed protection is increasing and appears to be a part of future water strategies across canada we established a goal in may 2008 to reduce water use at our cellulose fibers mills 20 percent by 2012 using a 2007 baseline we achieved a 19 percent water use reduction in 2011 compared to our 2007 baseline

risk factors 

we are subject to certain risks and events that if one or more of them occur could adversely affect our business our financial condition our results of operations and the trading price of our common stock 

you should consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information presented in this report and the matters described in “ forwardlooking statements ” as well as the other reports and registration statements we file from time to time with the sec in evaluating us our business and an investment in our securities 

the risks below are not the only risks we face additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely affect our business 



macroeconomic conditions 

the industries in which we operate are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions and consequently highly cyclical 

the overall levels of demand for the products we manufacture and distribute reflect fluctuations in levels of enduser demand which consequently impact our sales and profitability enduser demand depends in part on general macroeconomic conditions in north america and worldwide as well as on local economic conditions current economic conditions in the united states reflect slow growth and high levels of consumer and business uncertainty which has been fueled by fiscal concerns with the us as well as global economic issues such as european sovereign debt and slowing growth in china the homebuilding industry including our real estate business has seen increased demand for new homes resulting in falling inventories which contributed to some improvement in selling prices for new and existing homes this improvement is highly dependent on continued improvement in the overall economy the relative health of which has been subject to the numerous shocks and obstacles including those mentioned earlier our wood products segment is highly dependent on the strength of the homebuilding industry the decline in home construction activity which occurred as a result of the credit bubble and recession resulted in depressed prices of and demand for wood products and building materials this was reflected in lower prices and demand for logs and reduced harvests in our timberland segment the length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time and by product but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions those conditions improved for some sectors such as homebuilding but deteriorated for other sectors such as cellulose fibers as the global demand for pulp has declined with the slowing economies in europe and asia 

commodity products 

many of our products are commodities that are widely available from other producers 

because commodity products have few distinguishing properties from producer to producer competition for these products is based primarily on price which is determined by supply relative to demand and competition from substitute products prices for our products are affected by many factors outside of our control and we have no influence over the timing and extent of price changes which often are volatile our profitability with respect to these products depends in part on managing our costs particularly raw material and energy costs which represent significant components of our operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control prices of and demand for many of our products have fluctuated significantly in recent quarters while many of our raw material or energy costs have increased as a result both sales and profitability are subject to volatility due to market forces beyond our control 

industry supply of logs wood products and pulp 

excess supply of products may adversely affect prices and margins 

oversupply of products also may result from producers introducing new capacity or increasing harvest levels in response to favorable shortterm pricing trends industry supplies of pulp also are influenced by overseas production capacity which has grown in recent years and is expected to continue to grow while the weakness of the us dollar in recent years has improved the company’s competitive position the recent strengthening of the us dollar and decreases in demand for consumer products in emerging markets may result in lower prices continuation of these factors could materially and adversely affect sales volumes and margins of our operations 

  

homebuilding market and economic risks 

high unemployment low demand and low levels of consumer confidence could continue to adversely affect our sales volume pricing and margins and result in further impairments 

demand for homes is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as the level of employment consumer confidence consumer income the availability of financing and interest rate levels during the period of 2007 through 2011 the mortgage industry experienced significant instability and increasing default rates particularly with regard to subprime and other nonconforming loans this caused many lenders to tighten credit requirements and reduce the number of mortgage loans available for financing home purchases credit conditions have begun to ease but remain significantly more restrictive than prior to 2007 demand for new homes also has been adversely affected by factors such as continued high unemployment and weak consumer confidence foreclosure rates and distress sales of houses while still at elevated levels have fallen and are less of an impact compared to the years immediately following the house collapse 

the company has traditionally carried a larger supply of land for development than many of our competitors land markets and prices have been volatile in recent years and significant changes in the real estate markets in which we operate may create valuation risk for this land although our land portfolio may reduce inventory risk for certain of our homebuilding operations and may create the opportunity to generate revenue from the sale of nonstrategic assets to third parties the company will be required to purchase additional lots to support our homebuilding operations intense competition for land may significantly increase the prices we pay to acquire land and lots in the near term 

  weyerhaeuser company  2012 annual report and form 10k   23 

our homebuyers’ ability to qualify for and obtain affordable mortgages could be affected by changes in government sponsored entities and private mortgage insurance companies supporting the mortgage market 

the federal government has historically had a significant role in supporting mortgage lending through its sponsorship of fannie mae and freddie mac as a result of turbulence in the credit markets and mortgage finance industry in the last few years the effect of the federal government’s conservatorship of these government sponsored entities on the shortterm and longterm demand for new housing remains unclear the liquidity provided to the mortgage industry by fannie mae and freddie mac both of which purchase home mortgages and mortgagebacked securities originated by mortgage lenders is critical to the housing market there have been significant concerns about the future purpose of fannie mae and freddie mac and a number of proposals to curtail their activities over time are under review any limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these entities could adversely affect interest rates mortgage financing and increase the effective cost of our homes which could reduce demand for our homes and adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in mortgage interest expense and real estate tax regulations could harm our future sales and earnings 

significant costs of homeownership include mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes both of which are generally deductible for an individual’s federal and in some cases state income taxes any changes to income tax laws by the federal government or a state government to eliminate or substantially reduce these income tax deductions as has been considered from time to time would increase the aftertax cost of owning a home increases in real estate taxes by local governmental authorities also increase the cost of homeownership any such increases to the cost of homeownership could adversely affect the demand for and sales prices of new homes 

capital markets 

deterioration in economic conditions and the credit markets could adversely affect our access to capital 

financial and credit markets have experienced turmoil and which may impair the company’s ability to borrow money similarly our customers may be unable to borrow money to fund their operations 

continued deteriorating or volatile market conditions could 

 

changes in credit ratings 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results actions that we take their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing the company on a watch list for possible future downgrading downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading could limit our access to the credit markets increase our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

substitution 

some of our products are vulnerable to declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials 

our products may compete with nonfiberbased alternatives or with alternative products in certain market segments for example plastic woodplastic or composite materials may be used by builders as alternatives to the products produced by our wood products businesses such as lumber veneer plywood and oriented strand board changes in prices for oil chemicals and woodbased fiber can change the competitive position of our products relative to available alternatives and could increase substitution of those products for our products as the use of these alternatives grows demand for our products may further decline 

changes in product mix or pricing 

our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by changes in product mix or pricing 

our results may be affected by a change in our sales mix our outlook assumes a certain volume and product mix of sales if actual results vary from this projected volume and product mix of sales our operations and our results could be negatively affected our outlook also assumes we will be successful in implementing previously announced or future price increases or plans to move customers to higherpriced products delays in acceptance of price increases or failure of customers to accept higherpriced products could negatively affect our results moreover price discounting if required to maintain our competitive position could result in lower than anticipated price realizations 

intense competition 

we face intense competition in our markets and the failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we compete with north american and for many of our product lines global producers some of which may have greater financial resources and lower production costs than we do the principal basis for competition is selling price our ability to maintain satisfactory margins depends in large part on our ability to control our costs our industries also are particularly sensitive to other factors including innovation design quality and service with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line to the extent that one or more of our competitors become more successful with respect to any key competitive factor our ability to attract and retain customers could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to compete effectively such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  weyerhaeuser company  2012 annual report and form 10k   24 

another emerging form of competition is between brands of sustainably produced products customer demand for certain brands could reduce competition among buyers for our products or cause other adverse effects 

in north america our forests are thirdparty certified to the sustainable forestry initiative sfi® standard some of our customers have expressed a preference in certain of our product lines for products made from raw materials sourced from forests certified to different standards including standards of the forest stewardship council fsc if and to the extent that this preference becomes a customer requirement there may be reduced demand and lower prices for our products relative to competitors who can supply products sourced from forests certified to competing certification standards if we seek to comply with such other standards we could incur materially increased costs for our operations or be required to reduce harvest levels fsc in particular employs standards that are geographically variable and could cause a material reduction in the harvest levels of some of our timberlands most notably in the pacific northwest 

material disruption of manufacturing 

a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales or negatively affect our results of operation and financial condition 

any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

 any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products or require us to make unplanned capital expenditures if one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired resulting in lower sales and income 

  

capital requirements 

our operations require substantial capital 

the company has substantial capital requirements for expansion and repair or replacement of existing facilities or equipment although we maintain our production equipment with regular scheduled maintenance key pieces of equipment may need to be repaired or replaced periodically the costs of repairing or replacing such equipment and the associated downtime of the affected production line could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we believe our capital resources will be adequate to meet our current projected operating needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements if for any reason we are unable to provide for our operating needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements on economic terms we could experience a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

environmental laws and regulations 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with violations of or liabilities under applicable environmental laws and other laws and regulations 

we are subject to a wide range of general and industryspecific laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing 

 for example the us environmental protection agency epa is in the process of implementing final rules regulating greenhouse gases that apply to our operations on a projectbyproject basis and may be applied to carbon dioxide emissions from biomass these and similar laws and regulations in the us and canada will require us to obtain authorizations from and comply with the authorization requirements of the appropriate governmental authorities which have considerable discretion over the terms and timing of permits 

we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations and as a result of remedial obligations we also could incur substantial costs such as civil or criminal fines sanctions and enforcement actions including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions cleanup and closure costs and thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations 

  weyerhaeuser company  2012 annual report and form 10k   25 

as the owner and operator of real estate including in our homebuilding business we may be liable under environmental laws for cleanup closure and other damages resulting from the presence and release of hazardous substances on or from our properties or operations in addition surface water management regulations may present liabilities and are subject to change the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict and in some cases our liability may exceed forecasted amounts or the value of the property itself the discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at our sites or thirdparty sites may result in significant additional costs any material liability we incur could adversely affect our financial condition or preclude us from making capital expenditures that otherwise would benefit our business 

we also anticipate public policy developments at the state federal and international level regarding climate change and energy access security and competitiveness we expect these developments to address emission of carbon dioxide renewable energy and fuel standards and the monetization of carbon compliance with regulations that implement new public policy in these areas might require significant expenditures these developments may also include mandated changes to energy use and building codes which could affect our homebuilding practices enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretation of these laws or regulations might require significant expenditures we also anticipate public policy developments at the state federal and international level regarding taxes health care and a number of other areas that could require significant expenditures 

currency exchange rates 

we will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates 

we have manufacturing operations in canada uruguay and brazil we are also a large exporter and compete with producers of products very similar to ours therefore we are affected by changes in the strength of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar euro and yen and the strength of the euro relative to the yen 

availability of raw materials and energy 

our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials and energy 

we rely heavily on certain raw materials principally wood fiber and chemicals and energy sources principally natural gas electricity coal and fuel oil in our manufacturing processes our ability to increase earnings has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials and energy sources we may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material or energy costs through hedging arrangements price increases productivity improvements or costreduction programs 

transportation 

we depend on third parties for transportation services and increases in costs and the availability of transportation could materially adversely affect our business and operations 

our business depends on the transportation of a large number of products both domestically and internationally we rely primarily on third parties for transportation of the products we manufacture or distribute as well as delivery of our raw materials in particular a significant portion of the goods we manufacture and raw materials we use are transported by railroad or trucks which are highly regulated 

if any of our thirdparty transportation providers were to fail to deliver the goods we manufacture or distribute in a timely manner we may be unable to sell those products at full value — or at all similarly if any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner we may be unable to manufacture our products in response to customer demand in addition if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us we may be unable to replace them at reasonable cost 

any failure of a thirdparty transportation provider to deliver raw materials or finished products in a timely manner could harm our reputation negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation 

in addition an increase in transportation rates or fuel surcharges could materially adversely affect our sales and profitability 

reit status and tax implications 

if we fail to remain qualified as a reit our taxable income would be subject to tax at corporate rates and we would not be able to deduct dividends to shareholders 

in any taxable year in which we fail to qualify as a reit unless we are entitled to relief under the internal revenue code 

 qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code to our operations and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions although we operate in a manner consistent with the reit qualification rules we cannot assure you that we are or will remain so qualified 

in addition federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process the internal revenue service the united states department of the treasury and state taxing authorities changes to the tax law could adversely affect our shareholders we cannot predict with certainty whether when in what forms or with what effective dates the tax laws applicable to us or our shareholders may be changed 

certain of our business activities are potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax or corporatelevel income tax 

under the internal revenue code reits generally must engage in the ownership and management of income producing real estate for the company this generally includes owning and managing a timberland portfolio for the production and sale of standing timber accordingly the manufacture and sale by us of wood products the harvesting and sale of logs and the development or sale of certain timberlands the manufacture and sale of pulp products the development of real estate the building and sale of singlefamily houses and the development and sale of land and lots for real estate development are conducted through one or more of our whollyowned taxable reit subsidiaries “trss” because such activities could generate nonqualifying reit income and could constitute “prohibited transactions” prohibited transactions are defined by the internal revenue code generally to be sales or other dispositions of property to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or 

  weyerhaeuser company  2012 annual report and form 10k   26 

business by conducting our business in this manner we believe that we satisfy the reit requirements of the internal revenue code and are not subject to the 100 percent tax that could be imposed if a reit were to conduct a prohibited transaction the net income of our trss is subject to corporatelevel income tax 

the extent of our use of our trs may affect the price of our common shares relative to the share price of other reits 

we conduct a significant portion of our business activities through one or more trss our use of our trss enables us to engage in nonreit qualifying business activities such as the sale of logs production and sale of wood products and pulp products real estate development and singlefamily home sales and sale of hbu property our trss are subject to corporatelevel tax therefore we pay income taxes on the income generated by our trss under the code no more than 25 percent of the value of the gross assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trs this limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our trss’ operations furthermore our use of trss may cause the market to value our common shares differently than the shares of other reits which may not use trss as extensively as we use them 

we may be limited in our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our taxable reit subsidiaries 

the ability of the reit to receive dividends from our trs is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a reit in particular at least 75 percent of gross income for each taxable year as a reit must be derived from passive real estate sources including sales of our standing timber and other types of qualifying real estate income and no more than 25 percent of our gross income may consist of dividends from our trs and other nonreal estate income 

this limitation on our ability to receive dividends from our trss may affect our ability to fund cash distributions to our shareholders using cash flows from our trss the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed and income that is not distributed will not be subject to the reit income distribution requirement 

our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate 

generally reits are required to distribute 90 percent of their ordinary taxable income and 95 percent of their net capital gains income capital gains may be retained by the reit but would be subject to income taxes if capital gains are retained rather than distributed our shareholders would be notified and they would be deemed to have received a taxable distribution with a refundable credit for any federal income tax paid by the reit accordingly we believe that we are not required to distribute material amounts of cash since substantially all of our taxable income is treated as capital gains income our board of directors in its sole discretion determines the amount of quarterly dividends to be provided to our shareholders based on consideration of a number of factors these factors include but are not limited to our results of operations cash flow and capital requirements economic conditions tax considerations borrowing capacity and other factors including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments future acquisitions and divestitures harvest levels changes in the price and demand for our products and general market demand for timberlands including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses consequently our dividend levels may fluctuate 

we may not be able to complete desired likekind exchange transactions for timberlands and real estate we sell 

when we sell timberlands and real estate we generally seek to match these sales with the acquisition of suitable replacement timberlands this allows us “likekind exchange” treatment for these transactions under section 1031 and related regulations of the code this matching of sales and purchases provides us with significant tax benefits most importantly the deferral of any gain on the property sold until ultimate disposition of the replacement property while we attempt to complete likekind exchanges wherever practical we may not be able to do so in all instances due to various factors including the lack of availability of suitable replacement property on acceptable terms and our inability to complete a qualifying likekind exchange transaction within the time frames required by the code the inability to obtain likekind exchange treatment would result in the payment of taxes with respect to the property sold and a corresponding reduction in earnings and cash available for distribution to shareholders as dividends

  weyerhaeuser company  2012 annual report and form 10k   28 




 legal proceedings 

we are a party to a number of legal proceedings and adverse judgments in certain legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

the costs and other effects of pending litigation against us and related insurance recoveries cannot be determined with certainty although the disclosure in note 15 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies  of notes to consolidated financial statements  contains management’s current views of the effect such litigation will have on our financial results there can be no assurance that the outcome of such proceedings will be as expected 

for example there have been several lawsuits filed against us alleging that we violated us antitrust laws those included lawsuits alleging antitrust violations against us and other manufacturers of oriented strand board and lawsuits alleging antitrust violations with respect to alder logs and lumber all of these matters have been settled 

it is possible that there could be adverse judgments against us in some or all major litigation against us and that we could be required to take a charge for all or a portion of any damage award any such charge could materially and adversely affect our results of operations for the quarter or year in which we record it 

export taxes 

we may be required to pay significant export taxes or countervailing and antidumping duties for exported products 

we may experience reduced revenues and margins on some of our businesses as a result of export taxes or countervailing and antidumping duty assessments international trade disputes occur frequently and can be taken to an international trade court for resolution of unfair trade practices between countries for example there have been many disputes and subsequent trade agreements regarding sales of softwood lumber between canada and the united states the current softwood lumber act signed in october 2006 requires our canadian softwood lumber facilities to pay an export tax when the price of lumber is at or below a threshold price the export tax could be as high as 225 percent if a province exceeds its total allotted export share it is possible that additional countervailing duty and antidumping tariffs or similar type tariffs could be imposed on us in the future we may experience reduced revenues and margins in any business that is subject to such tariffs or to the terms of the settlements of such international disputes these tariffs or settlement terms could have a material adverse effect on our business financial results and financial condition including facility closures or impairments of assets

natural disasters 

our business and operations could be adversely affected by weather fire infestation or natural disasters 

our timberlands assets may be damaged by adverse weather severe wind and rainstorms fires pest infestation or other natural disasters because our manufacturing processes primarily use wood fiber in many cases from our own timberlands in the event of material damage to our timberlands our operations could be disrupted or our production costs could be increased as is typical in the forestry industry we do not insure against losses of timber including losses due to these causes 



stockprice volatility 

the price of our common stock may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors some of which are beyond our control including those described above under  risks related to our industries and business  and the following 

 in addition there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in the forest products industry that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 

some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them if litigation of this type is brought against us it could result in substantial costs and would divert management’s attention and resources

our mda includes the following major sections 

 



in 2012 the us economy advanced at a muted pace us recovery was hindered by slowing global growth as well as domestic issues which included the rising us deficit and political uncertainty related to the fall elections continued uncertainty on the part of business and consumers limited investment and spending these factors significantly affected the economy limiting anticipated improvements in key economic indicators the us housing market while affected by these factors showed signs of improvement in 2012 as lower inventories of new and existing homes led to increases in construction and home values the strength of the us housing market strongly affects our real estate wood products and timberlands segments real estate focuses on building singlefamily homes wood products primarily sells into the new residential building and repair and remodel markets demand for logs from our timberlands segment is affected by the production of woodbased building products as well as export demand cellulose fibers is primarily affected by global demand and the relative strength of the us dollar 

housing market 

we track certain indicators such as employment consumer confidence housing starts home sales foreclosures home prices mortgage interest rates and the number of homes for sale to assess housing market conditions the following market statements refer to industry conditions in general and not to weyerhaeuser operations directly 

total us housing starts for 2012 were 781   thousand units with single family units accounting for 535 thousand of the total this represents a 23 percent increase in single family starts from 2011 multifamily construction also increased in 2012 to 246 thousand units compared with 178 thousand in 2011 while a significant improvement current housing demand remains well below 1   million or more single family starts the typical level during the 15year period of 19922007 in 2012 new home sales in the us averaged 366   thousand units this level represents a 19 percent increase over 2011 which had the lowest number of new home sales since 1963 when us census started reporting this data through much of 2012 the unemployment rate has remained above 8   percent but as of december had fallen to 78   percent the lowest level for the year weak employment growth contributed to weak consumer confidence limiting much of the potential growth in demand for housing and wood products the number of mortgages in default remains above historic pre 2006 levels but has fallen significantly since the peak in 2009 although this factor will continue to contribute to the inventory of existing homes for sale it is diminishing in significance as the overall housing market continues to improve from the credit crisis and recession of 2009 

demand for wood products has gradually improved as housing starts have increased overall demand levels for lumber increased 6   percent from 2011 with a similar 6 percent rise in the demand for structural panels despite the improvement demand for both lumber and panels remain below peak levels however industry operating rates for lumber and structural panels have improved over 2011 and this has resulted in higher prices than those observed in 2011 prices for most commodity wood products were higher in 2012 with the greatest increases in southern yellow pine lumber and oriented strand board osb demand for logs increased as lumber production increased in the west demand for logs was bolstered by demand from japan china and korea although demand from china is lower than in 2011 in the south several years of deferred harvest due to weak demand have created increased inventories and as a result southern pine log prices were relatively flat in 2012 

us dollarglobal demand 

the us dollar remained weak relative to many global currencies during 2012 however the year was characterized by volatility in euro exchange rates as a result of the debt crisis in eurozone countries the us dollar strengthened against the euro for much of 2012 which had a detrimental effect on cellulose fibers as our pulp mills became less competitive against competitors with euro denominated costs additionally the slowdown in the key global economies of europe and china led to a slowdown in pulp demand putting additional downward pressure on prices as operating rates worldwide moved lower the key indicator northern bleached softwood kraft nbsk pulp fell to an average of 813ton delivered n europe in 2012 this was a 15 percent decline from 2011   pulp prices started the first half of the year at 837ton which was lower than 2011 and fell below 800ton in the third quarter 

japan experienced an uptick in housing starts in 2012 with total housing starts in japan increasing 5   percent from 2011 levels shipment of logs to japan increased 6 percent over 2011 in 2012 the us dollar yen exchange rate was comparable to 2011 however the yen began to weaken in the fourth quarter making us wood less affordable in yen terms this was offset to some extent by the appreciating euro which increased the cost of competing supplies from europe into japan the export log market was affected by the slowdown in china  s construction sector related to the overall slowdown in the chinese economy chinese imports of softwood logs from the us were lower than the same period in 2011 but above 2010 levels 

  weyerhaeuser company  2012 annual report and form 10k   31 

where we are headed 

growth in the us economy is estimated to be 22 percent for 2012 and the expectation is for slightly lower growth of 19 percent in 2013 the ongoing weak economic recovery from the recession of 2009 has limited job growth and improvements in consumer confidence and spending the us is expected to add enough jobs to continue to lower the overall unemployment rate in 2013 but at a gradual pace   singlefamily starts are expected to continue to increase in 2013 a result of improving demand for homes and low inventories of new and existing homes for sale demand for wood products is expected to increase as a result of greater demand for housing prices for wood products in 2013 are expected to be similar to 2012 although some prices may weaken as previously idled manufacturing capacity is restarted and inventories increase log prices in western markets are expected to rise slightly with improving export and domestic demand in the south log prices are expected to remain near current levels until increased demand decreases inventories the us dollar is expected to remain weak relative to developed currencies outside of the euro which is expected to continue to be affected by uncertainty in the eurozone weakness in global pulp demand and volatility in the euro are expected to continue and to limit improvement in commodity pulp prices 



starting with our 2010 fiscal year we elected to be taxed as a reit we expect to derive most of our reit income from investments in timberlands including the sale of standing timber through payascut sales contracts reit income can be distributed to shareholders without first paying corporate level tax substantially eliminating the double taxation on income a significant portion of our timberland segment earnings receives this favorable tax treatment we are however subject to corporate taxes on builtingains the excess of fair market value over tax basis at january 1 2010 on sales of real property other than standing timber held by the reit during the first 10 years following the reit conversion we continue to be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on earnings of our taxable reit subsidiary trs which principally includes our manufacturing businesses our real estate development business and our nonqualified timberland segment income following are points related to our conversion

net contribution to earnings for unallocated items 



other unallocated items in 2012 included a gain of 103 million related to a postretirement plan amendment 

changes in unallocated pension and postretirement credits costs in 2011 compared to 2010 were primarily due to an increase of 100 million due to the amortization of deferred pension losses we amortize the cumulative unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses—generally in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or marketrelated value of plan assets at the beginning of the year—over the average remaining service period of the active employee group covered by the plans unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses arise primarily from differences between our expected longterm return on plan assets and the actual return in a particular year and changes in actuarial assumptions see note 8 pension and other postretirement benefit plans  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for more information 

other unallocated items in 2010 included a gain on the sale of five short line railroads of 46 million

critical accounting policies 

our critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and estimates they also have a high degree of complexity 

in accounting we base our judgments and estimates on 

 actual results however may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded 

our most critical accounting policies relate to our 

 details about our other significant accounting policies — what we use and how we estimate — are in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

pension and postretirement benefit plans 

we sponsor several pension and postretirement benefit plans for our employees key assumptions we use in accounting for the plans include our 

 at the end of every year we review our assumptions with external advisers and make adjustments as appropriate actual experience that differs from our assumptions or any changes in our assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

other factors that affect our accounting for the plans include 

 this section provides more information about our 

 expected longterm rate of return 

plan assets are assets of the pension plan trusts that fund the benefits provided under the pension plans the expected longterm rate of return is our estimate of the longterm rate of return that our plan assets will earn our expected longterm rate of return is important in determining the net income or expense we recognize for our plans 

over the 28 years it has been in place our us pension trust investment strategy has achieved a 148 percent  net compound annual return rate 

after considering available information at the end of 2012  we continue to assume an expected longterm rate of return of 90 percent factors we considered include 

 our expected longterm rate of return is important in determining the net income or expense we recognize for our plans every 05 percent decrease in our expected longterm rate of return would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately 

 likewise every 05 percent increase in our expected longterm rate of return would decrease expense or increase a credit by those same amounts 

the actual return on plan assets in any given year may vary from our expected longterm rate of return actual returns on plan assets affect the funded status of the plans differences between actual returns on plan assets and the expected longterm rate of return are reflected as adjustments to cumulative other comprehensive income loss a component of total equity 

  weyerhaeuser company  2012 annual report and form 10k   46 

discount rates 

our discount rates as of december 31 2012  are 

 we review our discount rates annually and revise them as needed the discount rates are selected at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of highquality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits 

pension and postretirement benefit expenses for 2013  will be based on the 37 percent  and 30 percent  assumed discount rates for us plans and 41 percent  and 40 percent  assumed discount rates for the canadian plans 

our discount rates are important in determining the cost of our plans a 05 percent decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately 

 longlived assets 

we review the carrying value of our longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations the carrying value is the amount assigned to longlived assets in our financial statements 

an impairment occurs when the carrying value of longlived assets will not be recovered from future cash flows and is more than fair market value fair market value is the estimated amount we would receive if we were to sell the assets 

in determining fair market value and whether impairment has occurred we are required to estimate 

 key assumptions we use in developing the estimates include 

 impairment of longlived assets real estate 

we review homebuilding longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 

real estate in process of development and land being processed for development 

real estate in process of development and land being processed for development includes subdivisions and master planned communities mpcs mpcs typically include several product segments such as residential active adult retail and commercial we evaluate impairment at the subdivision or mpc product segment level factors that are considered when evaluating a subdivision or mpc product segment for impairment include 

 we update the undiscounted cash flow forecast for each subdivision and mpc product segment that may be impaired the undiscounted cash flow forecasts are affected by communityspecific factors that include 

 the carrying amount of each subdivision and mpc product segment is written down to fair value when the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of a subdivision or mpc product segment an impairment charge for a subdivision or mpc product segment is allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot 

real estate for sale 

real estate for sale includes homes that have been completed and land that we intend to sell we regularly sell land or lots that do not fit our value proposition or development plans 

the carrying amount of real estate for sale is reduced to fair value less estimated costs to sell if the forecasted net proceeds are less than the carrying amount the fair value analysis is affected by local market economic conditions demographic factors and competitor actions and is inherently uncertain actual net proceeds can differ from the estimates the carrying amount of real estate for sale is evaluated quarterly 

  weyerhaeuser company  2012 annual report and form 10k   47 

market approach 

we use the market approach to determine fair value of real estate assets when information for comparable assets is available this approach is commonly used for completed inventory and individual assets for sale we typically use 

 income approach 

we generally use the income approach to determine fair value of real estate for our inactive projects and assets in process of development the income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example cash flows or earnings to a single present amount discounted the fair value measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations regarding those future estimated cash inflows and outflows we use present value techniques based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams the income approach relies on management judgment regarding the various inputs to the undiscounted cash flow forecasts 

contingent liabilities 

we are subject to lawsuits investigations and other claims related to environmental product and other matters and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 

we record contingent liabilities when 

 assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors including 

 in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that an ultimate loss may occur 

while we do our best in developing our projections recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain if estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges in other income expense net these exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flow in any given quarter or year see note 15 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for more information

current market conditions 

in 2011 the us economy slowed its pace of recovery the underlying causes included the japan earthquake and tsunami the us deficit and related political instability and european debt crisis these factors weighed heavily on the economy delaying many anticipated improvements in key economic indicators the us housing market continues to be affected by these events and consequently lags other sectors in the recovery improvement in the latter part of 2011 in key areas such as job creation industrial production and gdp may help spur growth in us housing however the sector remains burdened by excess inventory and a diminished pool of qualified home buyers the health of the us housing

this section provides information about how we 

 for each of our business segments we provide details about what we do where we do it how much we sell and where we are headed 

timberlands 

our timberlands business segment manages 64 million acres of private commercial forestland worldwide we own 57 million of those acres and lease the other 07 million acres in addition we have renewable longterm licenses on 139 million acres of forestland located in four canadian provinces the tables presented in this section include data from this segments business units as of the end of 2011 

what we do 

forestry management 

our timberlands business segment 

 our goal is to maximize returns by selling logs and stumpage to internal and external customers we focus on solid wood and use intensive silviculture to improve forest productivity and returns while managing our forests on a sustainable basis to meet customer and public expectations 

international operations in this segment consist principally of forest plantations forest licenses and converting assets in south america we serve as owners or managing partner in these operations which are either whollyowned subsidiaries or joint ventures in brazil we are the managing partner in a joint venture established in 2004 we own 67 percent of this joint venture and fibria celulose sa owns the remaining 33 percent a hardwood sawmill with 65000 cubic meters of capacity produces highvalue eucalyptus lyptus ®  lumber and related appearance wood products in china we are the managing partner in a joint venture established in 2007 we own 51 percent of this joint venture and fujian yong’an forestry company owns the remaining 49 percent as of december 31 2011  the joint venture managed 44000 acres of timberlands 

sustainable forestry practices 

we are committed to responsible environmental stewardship wherever we operate managing forests to produce financially mature timber while protecting the ecosystem services they provide our working forests include places with unique environmental cultural historical or recreational value to protect their unique qualities we follow regulatory requirements voluntary standards and implement the sustainable forestry initiative ®  sfi standard independent auditing of all of the forests we own or manage in the united states and canada certifies that we meet the sfi standard our forestlands in uruguay are forest stewardship council fsc certified or managed to the developing uruguayan national forestry management standard designed to meet the program for the endorsement of forest certification pefc 

canadian forestry operations 

in canada we have licenses to operate forestlands that provide raw material for our manufacturing units in various provinces when we harvest trees we pay the provinces at stumpage rates set by the government which generally are based on prevailing market prices we do not generate any profit in the timberlands segment from the harvest of timber from the licensed acres in canada 

other values from our timberlands 

in the united states we actively manage mineral oil and gas leases on our land and use geologic databases to identify and market opportunities for commercial mineral and geothermal development we recognize leasing revenue over the terms of agreements with customers revenue primarily comes from 

 in managing mineral resources we generate revenue related to our ownership of the minerals and separately related to our ownership of the surface the ownership of mineral rights and surface acres may be held by two separate parties materials that can be mined from the surface and whose value comes from factors other than their chemical composition typically belong to the surface owner examples of surface materials include rock sand gravel dirt and topsoil the mineral owner holds the title to commodities that derive value from their unique chemical composition examples of mineral rights include oil gas coal even if mined at the surface and precious metals if the two types of rights conflict then mineral rights generally are superior to surface rights a third type of land right is geothermal which can belong to either the surface or mineral owner we routinely reserve mineral and geothermal rights when selling surface timberlands acreage

timberlands products 



how we measure our product 

we report timberlands data in cubic meters cubic meters measure the total volume of wood fiber in a tree or log that we can sell cubic meter volume is determined from the large and smallend diameters and length and provides a more consistent and comparative measure of timber and log volume among operating regions species size and seasons of the year than other units of measure 

we also use two other units of measure when transacting business including 

 both measures are accurate in the regions where they are used but they do not provide a meaningful basis for comparisons between the regions 

the conversion rate for mbf to cubic meters varies based on several factors including diameter length and taper of the timber the average conversion rate for mbf to cubic meters is approximately 67 cubic meters per mbf 

the conversion rate from green tons to cubic meters also varies based on the season harvested and the specific gravity of the wood for the region where the timber is grown an average conversion rate for green tons to cubic meters is approximately 0825 cubic meters per green ton 

where we do it 

our timberlands assets are located primarily in north america in the us we own and manage sustainable forests in nine states for use in wood products and pulp and paper manufacturing we own or lease 

 our international operations are located primarily in uruguay and china in uruguay we own 300000 acres and have longterm leases on 26000 acres in china we have longterm leases on 44000 acres 

in addition we have renewable longterm licenses on 139 million acres of forestland owned by the provincial government of four canadian provinces 

our total timber inventory — including timber on owned and leased land in our us and international operations — is approximately 297 million cubic meters the timber inventory on licensed lands in canada is approximately 384 million cubic meters the amount of timber inventory does not translate into an amount of lumber or panel products because the quantity of end products 

 the species size and grade of the trees affects the relative value of our timberlands 

discussion of operations by geography 

summary of 2011 timber inventory and timberland locations 

united states 



  weyerhaeuser company  2011 annual report and form 10k   4 

western united states 

our western acres are well situated to serve the wood product markets in oregon and washington their location near weyerhaeuser mills and many thirdparty facilities allows for multiple sales opportunities in addition our location on the west coast provides access to highervalue export markets for douglas fir and hemlock logs in japan korea and china the size and quality of our western timberlands coupled with their proximity to several deepwater port facilities positions us to meet the needs of pacific rim log markets 

our lands are composed primarily of douglas fir a species highly valued for its structural strength our coastal lands also contain western hemlock and have a higher proportion of hemlock than our interior holdings our management systems which provide us a competitive operating advantage range from research and forestry to technical planning models mechanized harvesting and marketing and logistics 

the average age of timber harvested in 2011 was 51 years most of our us timberland is intensively managed for timber production but some areas are conserved for environmental historical recreational or cultural reasons some of our older trees are protected in acreage set aside for conservation and some are not yet logged due to harvest rate regulations while over the long term our average harvest age will decrease in accordance with our sustainable forestry practices we will only harvest approximately 15 percent of our western acreage each year 

southern united states 

our southern acres predominantly contain southern yellow pine and encompass timberlands in seven states this area provides a constant year round flow of logs to a variety of internal and thirdparty customers we sell grade logs to mills that manufacture a diverse range of products including lumber plywood and veneer we also sell chips and fiber logs to oriented strand board pulp and paper mills our timberlands are well located to take advantage of road logging and transportation systems for efficient delivery of logs to these customers 

we intensively manage our timber plantations using forestry research and planning systems to optimize grade log production we also actively manage our land to capture revenues from our oil gas and hard minerals resources we do this while providing quality habitat for a range of animals and birds which is in high demand for recreational purposes we lease more than 95 percent of our acres to the public and state wildlife agencies for recreational purposes 

the average age of timber harvested in 2011 was 31 years for southern yellow pine in accordance with our sustainable forestry practices we harvest approximately 30 percent to 35 percent of our acreage each year in the south 

international 



our forestlands in uruguay are approximately 51 percent loblolly pine and 49 percent eucalyptus on average the timber in uruguay is in the first third of its rotation age it is entering into that part of the growth rotation when we will see increased volume accretion about 93 percent of the area to be planted has been afforested to date the afforestation program is planned to be completed within the next two years 

in uruguay the target rotation ages are 21 to 22 years for pine and 14 to 17 years for eucalyptus we manage both species to a grade appearance regime 

we also operate a plywood mill in uruguay with a production capacity of 210000 cubic meters and a production volume of 140500 cubic meters reached in 2011 

in brazil weyerhaeuser is a managing partner in a joint venture we own 67 percent and fibria celulose sa owns 33 percent a hardwood sawmill with 65000 cubic meters of capacity produces highvalue eucalyptus lyptus ®  lumber and related appearance wood products the mill’s production in 2011 was 56000 cubic meters 

our investment in china is a joint venture with a public company that is controlled by the state and local governments weyerhaeuser is the managing partner in a joint venture started in 2007 ownership is 51 percent weyerhaeuser and 49 percent fujian yong’an forestry company the joint venture currently manages 44000 acres of timberlands 

in china the target rotation age is seven years since we are managing the forests of loblolly pine and eucalyptus for fiber 

canada — licensed timberlands 



  weyerhaeuser company  2011 annual report and form 10k   5 

we lease and license forestland in canada from the provincial government to secure the volume for our manufacturing units in the various provinces when the volume is harvested we pay the province at stumpage rates set by the government and generally based on prevailing market prices the harvested logs are transferred to our manufacturing facilities at cost stumpage plus harvest haul and overhead costs less any margin on selling logs to third parties any conversion profit is recognized at the respective mill in either the cellulose fibers or wood products segment 

fiveyear summary of timberlands production 



our timberlands annual fee depletion represents the harvest of the timber assets we own depletion is a method of expensing the cost of establishing the fee timber asset base over the harvest or timber sales volume the decline in fee depletion from 2008 through 2010 reflects the company’s decision to defer harvest and preserve the longterm value of the assets

the majority of our log sales to unaffiliated customers involves sales to the export market and to other domestic sawmills in the pacific northwest following is a fiveyear summary of selected export log prices 

fiveyear summary of selected export log prices 2 sawlog bark on — mbf 

our log prices are affected by the supply of and demand for grade and fiber logs and are influenced by the same factors that affect log sales export log prices are particularly affected by the japanese housing market 

average 2011 log realizations in the west increased from 2010 — primarily due to higher demand for logs in the chinese market export prices rose as a result of the demand from china which also resulted in higher western domestic prices average 2011 log realizations in the south decreased from 2010 — primarily due to weaker demand for logs in the south

mineral revenue decreased in 2011 as recognition of leasing revenue was completed on older leases and sales of producing oil and gas properties was limited the decline was partially offset by increased oil and gas royalties as the haynesville shale gas wells began to produce commercially earnings from construction aggregates decreased slightly revenues from wind power and geothermal agreements increased from yeartoyear as the company entered into three new wind power agreements and three new geothermal agreements 

where we’re headed 

our competitive strategies include 

 in addition we believe we will generate additional revenues from new products and services such as wetland mitigation banking and conservation easements and from participating in emerging carbon and energy markets

wood products volume 

the volume of structural lumber and osb sold in 2011 increased from 2010 due to increased demand and the reopening of our hudson bay saskatchewan osb facility volumes for engineered lumber decreased primarily due to continued weakness in the us housing market

wood products prices 

prices for commodity wood products — structural lumber osb and plywood — decreased in 2011 from 2010 

in general the following factors influence prices for wood products 

 the north american housing market continues to struggle through the worst downturn on record demand for new homes fell dramatically from 2006 through 2009 and has been relatively flat from 2010 through 2011 because demand for wood products is tied so closely to home construction the weakness in this industry has resulted in depressed demand for and prices of wood products the following graphs reflect product price trends for the past five years

what we do 

the real estate segment focuses on 

 real estate products and activities 



where we do it 

our operations are concentrated in metropolitan areas in arizona california maryland nevada texas virginia and washington 

how much we sell 

we are one of the top 20 homebuilding companies in the united states as measured by annual singlefamily home closings 

our revenues decreased to 838 million  in 2011  down 9 percent compared with 923 million  in 2010  this decrease occurred as a result of fewer home closings in a challenged market affected by low consumer confidence high unemployment tightened mortgage underwriting standards and continued downward pressure on pricing caused by excess supply 

the following factors affect revenues in our real estate business segment 

 –   the markets where we build vary by geography 

– we build homes that range in price points to meet our target customers’ needs from firsttime to semicustom homes based on geography and 

– the mix of price points which differ for traditional singlefamily detached homes and attached products such as townhomes and condominiums

many social values are expressed in the laws and regulations that pertain to growing and harvesting timber we participate in voluntary certification of our timberlands to assure that we sustain their values including the protection of wildlife and water quality we are also subject to laws regulating forestry practices changes in law and regulation can significantly affect local or regional timber harvest levels and market values of timberbased raw materials 

endangered species protections 

in the united states a number of fish and wildlife species that inhabit geographic areas near or within our timberlands have been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal endangered species act esa or similar state laws including 

 additional species or populations may be listed as threatened or endangered as a result of pending or future citizen petitions or petitions initiated by federal or state agencies 

restrictions on our timber harvests result or could result from 

 such actions also could increase our operating costs and affect timber supply and prices in general 

in canada 

 identify critical habitat 

 the identification and protection of habitat may over time result in additional restrictions on timber harvests and other forest management practices that could increase operating costs for operators of forestlands in canada to date these canadian measures have not had and in 2012  will not have a significant effect on our harvesting operations we anticipate that future measures will not disproportionately affect weyerhaeuser as compared with comparable operations 

regulations affecting forestry practices 

in the united states regulations established by federal state and local governments or agencies to protect water quality and wetlands could affect future harvests and forest management practices on some of our timberlands forest practice acts in some states in the united states that increasingly affect present or future harvest and forest management activities include 

 each state in which we own timberlands has developed best management practices to reduce the effects of forest practices on water quality and aquatic habitats additional and more stringent regulations may be adopted by various state and local governments to achieve waterquality standards under the federal clean water act protect fish and wildlife habitats or achieve other public policy objectives 

in canada our forest operations are carried out on public forestlands under forest licenses all forest operations are subject to 

 –   protect environmental values and 

–  encourage other stewardship values 

on may 18 2010 21 member companies of the forest products association of canada fpac including weyerhaeuser’s canadian subsidiary announced the signing of a canadian boreal forest agreement cbfa with nine environmental organizations the cbfa applies to approximately 72 million hectares of public forests licensed to fpac members and when fully implemented is expected to lead to the conservation of significant areas of canada’s boreal forest and protection of woodland caribou cbfa signatories continue to meet with provincial governments and aboriginal and local communities to seek their participation in advancing the goals of the cbfa progress under the cbfa is measured by an independent auditor

forest certification standards 

we operate in north america under the sustainable forestry initiative ®  this is a certification standard designed to supplement government regulatory programs with voluntary landowner initiatives to further protect certain public resources and values the sustainable forestry initiative ®  is an independent standard overseen by a governing board consisting of 

 compliance with the sustainable forestry initiative ®  may result in some increases in our operating costs and curtailment of our timber harvests in some areas 

what these regulations and certification programs mean to us 

the regulatory and nonregulatory forest management programs described above have 

 we believe that these kinds of programs have not had and in 2012  will not have a significant effect on the total harvest of timber in the united states or canada however these kinds of programs may have such an effect in the future we expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these programs as compared with typical owners of comparable timberlands we also expect that these programs will not significantly disrupt our planned operations over large areas or for extended periods 

canadian aboriginal rights 

many of the canadian forestlands are subject to the constitutionally protected treaty or commonlaw rights of aboriginal peoples of canada most 

of british columbia bc is not covered by treaties and as a result the claims of bc’s aboriginal peoples relating to forest resources are 

largely unresolved although many aboriginal groups are engaged in treaty discussions with the governments of bc and canada 

final or interim resolution of claims brought by aboriginal groups is expected to result in 

 we believe that such claims will not have a significant effect on our total harvest of timber or production of forest products in 2012 although they 

may have such an effect in the future in 2008 fpac of which we are a member signed a memorandum of understanding with the assembly of 

first nations under which the parties agree to work together to strengthen canada’s forest sector through economicdevelopment initiatives and 

business investments strong environmental stewardship and the creation of skilldevelopment opportunities particularly targeted to aboriginal 

youth 

pollutioncontrol regulations 

our operations are subject to various laws and regulations including 

 these laws and regulations as well as market demands impose controls with regard to 

 compliance with these laws regulations and demands usually involves capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs we cannot easily quantify the future amounts of capital expenditures we might have to make to comply with these laws regulations and demands or the effects on our operating costs because in some instances compliance standards have not been developed or have not become final or definitive in addition it is difficult to isolate the environmental component of most manufacturing capital projects 

our capital projects typically are designed to 

 we estimate that our capital expenditures made primarily for environmental compliance were approximately 5 million in 2011  approximately 2 percent of total capital expenditures based on our understanding of current regulatory requirements in the us and canada we expect no material capital expenditures for environmental compliance in 2012  

  weyerhaeuser company  2011 annual report and form 10k   18 

environmental cleanup 

we are involved in the environmental investigation or remediation of numerous sites of these sites 

 our liability with respect to these various sites ranges from insignificant to substantial the amount of liability depends on 

 we spent approximately 5 million in 2011  and expect to spend approximately 6 million in 2012  on environmental remediation of these sites 

it is our policy to accrue for environmentalremediation costs when we 

 we currently believe it is reasonably possible that our costs to remediate all the identified sites may exceed our current accruals of 34 million  the excess amounts required may be insignificant or could range in the aggregate up to 90 million  over several years this estimate of the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs is much less certain than the estimates we currently are using to determine how much to accrue the estimate of the upper range also uses assumptions less favorable to us among the range of reasonably possible outcomes 

regulation of air emissions in the us 

the united states environmental protection agency epa had promulgated regulations for air emissions from 

 these regulations cover 

 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit issued decisions in 2007 

 the epa must promulgate 

 pending final action by the epa we expect 

 we cannot currently quantify the amount of capital we will need in the future to comply with new regulations being developed by the epa or canadian environmental agencies because final rules have not been promulgated 

in 2007 the us supreme court ruled that greenhouse gases are pollutants that can be subject to regulation under the clean air act as a result the epa 

 it is unclear what the effect of epa’s greenhouse gas regulations will be on our operations until final rules regarding biomass emissions are promulgated 

to address concerns about greenhouse gases as a pollutant we 

   weyerhaeuser company  2011 annual report and form 10k   19 

additional factors that could affect greenhouse gas emissions in the future include 

 it is not yet known when and to what extent these policy activities may come into force or how they may relate to each other in the future 

we believe these measures have not had and in 2012  will not have a significant effect on our operations although they may have such an effect in the future we expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with typical owners of comparable operations we maintain an active forestry research program to track and understand any potential effect from actual climate change related parameters that could affect the forests we own and manage and do not anticipate any disruptions to our planned operations 

regulation of air emissions in canada 

in canada 

 measuring reporting and managing greenhouse gas emissions and protecting air quality 

the canada federal government 

 all canadian provincial governments 

 we believe these measures have not had and in 2012  will not have a significant effect on our operations although they may have such an effect in the future we expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with typical owners of comparable operations we also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations 

regulation of water 

in the us as a result of litigation some of which is ongoing additional federal or state permits will be required in the future 

under the federal clean water act in one or more of the states in which we operate in relation to 

 some of these permits will be in effect in 2012 and will entail additional costs for weyerhaeuser and some other forest landowners 

in canada in 2011 a national round table on the environment and the economy nrtee proposed changes to wateruse management across canada and recommended that federal provincial and territorial governments develop new water strategies nrtee will convene experts from across canada to develop a national action plan on how to effectively implement the reports recommendations recommendations which have not yet been developed may entail additional costs however we do not expect a disproportionate effect on weyerhaeuser as compared to comparable operations of other forest landowners 

potential changes in pollution regulation 

state governments continue to promulgate total maximum daily load tmdl requirements for pollutants in water bodies that do not meet state 

or epa water quality standards state tmdl requirements may 

 amounts of pollutants 

it is not possible to estimate the capital expenditures that may be required for us to meet pollution allocations across the various proposed state 

tmdl programs until a specific tmdl is promulgated 

various levels of government in canada have started work to address water usage and quality issues regional watershed protection is increasing and appears to be a part of future water strategies across canada as part of our membership in the us business roundtable see change society environment and economy initiative we established a goal in may 2008 to reduce water use at our cellulose fibers mills 20 percent by the end of 2012 using a 2007 baseline we achieved a 16 percent water use reduction in 2010 compared to our 2007 baseline

risk factors 

we are subject to certain risks and events that if one or more of them occur could adversely affect our business our financial condition our results of operations and the trading price of our common stock 

you should consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information presented in this report and the matters described in “forwardlooking statements” as well as the other reports and registration statements we file from time to time with the sec in evaluating us our business and an investment in our securities 

the risks below are not the only risks we face additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely affect our business 



macroeconomic conditions 

the industries in which we operate are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions and consequently highly cyclical 

the overall levels of demand for the products we manufacture and distribute and consequently our sales and profitability reflect fluctuations in levels of enduser demand which depend in part on general macroeconomic conditions in north america and worldwide as well as on local economic conditions current economic conditions in the united states and the global economic downturn combined with the decreased availability of credit due to extremely conservative underwriting criteria and high foreclosure rates has resulted in a continued weakness in the homebuilding industry including the company’s real estate business increased inventories of available new homes significant declines in home prices loss of homeequity values and loss of consumer confidence and demand our wood products segment is highly dependent on the strength of the homebuilding industry and the weakness in that industry has resulted in depressed prices of and demand for wood products and building materials this has been further reflected in declining prices and demand for logs and reduced harvests in our timberland segment the length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time and by product but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions a further decline in the recovery of consumer demand could further adversely affect our businesses 

commodity products 

many of our products are commodities that are widely available from other producers 

because commodity products have few distinguishing properties from producer to producer competition for these products is based primarily on price which is determined by supply relative to demand and competition from substitute products prices for our products are affected by many factors outside of our control and we have no influence over the timing and extent of price changes which often are volatile our profitability with respect to these products depends in part on managing our costs particularly raw material and energy costs which represent significant components of our operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control prices of and demand for many of our products have declined significantly in recent quarters while many of our raw material or energy costs have increased this has adversely affected both our sales and profitability 

industry supply of logs wood products and pulp 

excess supply of products may adversely affect prices and margins 

industry supply of logs wood products and pulp is subject to changing macroeconomic and industry conditions that may cause producers to idle or permanently close individual machines or entire mills or to decrease harvest levels to avoid substantial cash costs in connection with idling or closing a mill some producers choose to continue to operate at a loss which could prolong weak prices due to oversupply oversupply of products also may result from producers introducing new capacity or increasing harvest levels in response to favorable shortterm pricing trends industry supplies of pulp also are influenced by overseas production capacity which has grown in recent years and is expected to continue to grow while the weakness of the us dollar in recent years has improved the company’s competitive position and mitigated the levels of imports the recent strengthening of the us dollar and decreases in demand for consumer products in emerging markets may result in increased imports of pulp from overseas resulting in lower prices continuation of these factors could materially and adversely affect sales volumes and margins of our operations 

  

homebuilding market and economic risks 

continuing high foreclosure rates low demand and low levels of consumer confidence could continue to adversely affect our sales volume pricing and margins and result in further impairments 

demand for homes is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as the level of employment consumer confidence consumer income the availability of financing and interest rate levels during the period of 2007 through 2011 the mortgage industry experienced significant instability and increasing default rates particularly with regard to subprime and other nonconforming loans this caused many lenders to tighten credit requirements and reduce the number of mortgage loans available for financing home purchases demand for new homes also has been adversely affected by factors such as continued high unemployment elevated foreclosure rates and distress sales of houses significant declines in home values and a collapse of consumer confidence while our cancellation rates have improved homebuyers may still find it more advantageous to forfeit a deposit than to complete the purchase of the home because of the fear of further price declines 

the company has traditionally carried a larger supply of land for development than many of our competitors some of the land was purchased during the last few years land prices have fallen in these markets and may continue to fall as new housing demand in our markets has fallen significantly we have elected to sell some of our nonstrategic land and lots at a loss or declined to exercise options even though that required us to forfeit deposits and write off preacquisition costs we also have changed our competitive strategies in some markets and elected to discontinue or postpone development in other markets in response to the downturn as a result we continue to look for opportunities to reposition our portfolio through the sale of our assets 

  weyerhaeuser company  2011 annual report and form 10k   22 

our homebuyers’ ability to qualify for and obtain affordable mortgages could be affected by changes in government sponsored entities and private mortgage insurance companies supporting the mortgage market 

the federal government has historically had a significant role in supporting mortgage lending through its sponsorship of fannie mae and freddie mac as a result of turbulence in the credit markets and mortgage finance industry in the last few years the effect of the federal government’s conservatorship of these government sponsored entities on the shortterm and longterm demand for new housing remains unclear the liquidity provided to the mortgage industry by fannie mae and freddie mac both of which purchase home mortgages and mortgagebacked securities originated by mortgage lenders is critical to the housing market there have been significant concerns about the future purpose of fannie mae and freddie mac and a number of proposals to curtail their activities over time are under review any limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these entities could adversely affect interest rates mortgage financing and increase the effective cost of our homes which could reduce demand for our homes and adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in tax regulations could harm our future sales and earnings 

significant costs of homeownership include mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes both of which are generally deductible for an individual’s federal and in some cases state income taxes any changes to income tax laws by the federal government or a state government to eliminate or substantially reduce these income tax deductions as has been considered from time to time would increase the aftertax cost of owning a home increases in real estate taxes by local governmental authorities also increase the cost of homeownership any such increases to the cost of homeownership could adversely affect the demand for and sales prices of new homes 

capital markets 

deterioration in economic conditions and the credit markets could adversely affect our access to capital 

financial and credit markets have been experiencing a period of turmoil that has included the failure or sale of various financial institutions a continuing series of international economic crises particularly in europe and increasingly restrictive underwriting standards while it is difficult to predict the ultimate results of these events they may impair the company’s ability to borrow money similarly our customers may be unable to borrow money to fund their operations 

continued deteriorating or volatile market conditions could 

 

changes in credit ratings 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results actions that we take their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing the company on a watch list for possible future downgrading downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading could limit our access to the credit markets increase our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

substitution 

some of our products are vulnerable to declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials 

our products may compete with nonfiberbased alternatives or with alternative products in certain market segments for example plastic woodplastic or composite materials may be used by builders as alternatives to the products produced by our wood products businesses such as lumber veneer plywood and oriented strand board changes in prices for oil chemicals and woodbased fiber can change the competitive position of our products relative to available alternatives and could increase substitution of those products for our products as the use of these alternatives grows demand for our products may further decline 

changes in product mix or pricing 

our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by changes in product mix or pricing 

our results may be affected by a change in our sales mix our outlook assumes a certain volume and product mix of sales if actual results vary from this projected volume and product mix of sales our operations and our results could be negatively affected our outlook also assumes we will be successful in implementing previously announced or future price increases or plans to move customers to higherpriced products delays in acceptance of price increases or failure of customers to accept higherpriced products could negatively affect our results moreover price discounting if required to maintain our competitive position could result in lower than anticipated price realizations 

intense competition 

we face intense competition in our markets and the failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we compete with north american and for many of our product lines global producers some of which may have greater financial resources and lower production costs than we do the principal basis for competition is selling price our ability to maintain satisfactory margins depends in large part on our ability to control our costs our industries also are particularly sensitive to other factors including innovation design quality and service with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line to the extent that one or more of our competitors become more 

  weyerhaeuser company  2011 annual report and form 10k   23 

successful with respect to any key competitive factor our ability to attract and retain customers could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to compete effectively such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

material disruption of manufacturing 

a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales or negatively affect our results of operation and financial condition 

any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

 any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products or require us to make unplanned capital expenditures if one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired resulting in lower sales and income 

  

capital requirements 

our operations require substantial capital 

the company has substantial capital requirements for expansion and repair or replacement of existing facilities or equipment although we maintain our production equipment with regular scheduled maintenance key pieces of equipment may need to be repaired or replaced periodically the costs of repairing or replacing such equipment and the associated downtime of the affected production line could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we believe our capital resources will be adequate to meet our current projected operating needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements if for any reason we are unable to provide for our operating needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements on economic terms we could experience a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

laws and regulations 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with violations of or liabilities under applicable environmental laws and other laws and regulations 

we are subject to a wide range of general and industryspecific laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing 

 for example the us environmental protection agency epa is in the process of developing maximum achievable control technology mact standards that regulate air emissions from pulp and paper facilities wood products facilities and industrial boilers the epa also is in the process of developing final rules regulating greenhouse gases that apply to our operations on a projectbyproject basis and may be applied to carbon dioxide emissions from biomass these and similar laws and regulations in the us and canada will require us to obtain authorizations from and comply with the authorization requirements of the appropriate governmental authorities which have considerable discretion over the terms and timing of permits 

we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations and as a result of remedial obligations we also could incur substantial costs such as civil or criminal fines sanctions and enforcement actions including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions cleanup and closure costs and thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations 

as the owner and operator of real estate including in our homebuilding business we may be liable under environmental laws for cleanup closure and other damages resulting from the presence and release of hazardous substances on or from our properties or operations the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict and in some cases our liability may exceed forecasted amounts or the value of the property itself the discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at our sites or thirdparty sites may result in significant additional costs any material liability we incur could adversely affect our financial condition or preclude us from making capital expenditures that otherwise would benefit our business 

we also anticipate public policy developments at the state federal and international level regarding climate change and energy access security and competitiveness we expect these developments to address emission of carbon dioxide renewable energy and fuel standards and the 

  weyerhaeuser company  2011 annual report and form 10k   24 

monetization of carbon compliance with regulations that implement new public policy in these areas might require significant expenditures enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretation of these laws or regulations might require significant expenditures we also anticipate public policy developments at the state federal and international level regarding taxes health care and a number of other areas that could require significant expenditures 

currency exchange rates 

we will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates 

we have manufacturing operations in canada uruguay and brazil we are also a large exporter and compete with producers of products very similar to ours therefore we are affected by changes in the strength of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar euro and yen and the strength of the euro relative to the yen 

availability of raw materials and energy 

our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials and energy 

we rely heavily on certain raw materials principally wood fiber and chemicals and energy sources principally natural gas electricity coal and fuel oil in our manufacturing processes our ability to increase earnings has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials and energy sources we may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material or energy costs through hedging arrangements price increases productivity improvements or costreduction programs 

transportation 

we depend on third parties for transportation services and increases in costs and the availability of transportation could materially adversely affect our business and operations 

our business depends on the transportation of a large number of products both domestically and internationally we rely primarily on third parties for transportation of the products we manufacture or distribute as well as delivery of our raw materials in particular a significant portion of the goods we manufacture and raw materials we use are transported by railroad or trucks which are highly regulated 

if any of our thirdparty transportation providers were to fail to deliver the goods we manufacture or distribute in a timely manner we may be unable to sell those products at full value — or at all similarly if any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner we may be unable to manufacture our products in response to customer demand in addition if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us we may be unable to replace them at reasonable cost 

any failure of a thirdparty transportation provider to deliver raw materials or finished products in a timely manner could harm our reputation negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation 

in addition an increase in transportation rates or fuel surcharges could materially adversely affect our sales and profitability 

reit status 

if we fail to remain qualified as a reit we would be subject to tax at corporate rates and would not be able to deduct dividends to shareholders when computing our taxable income because our timberrelated income will be subject to taxation 

in any taxable year in which we fail to qualify as a reit unless we are entitled to relief under the internal revenue code 

 if we fail to qualify as a reit we might need to borrow funds or liquidate some investments to pay the additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment or dividends to our shareholders could be reduced 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code to our operations and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions although we operate in a manner consistent with the reit qualification rules we cannot assure you that we are or will remain so qualified 

in addition federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process the internal revenue service the united states department of the treasury and state taxing authorities changes to the tax law could adversely affect our shareholders we cannot predict with certainty whether when in what forms or with what effective dates the tax laws applicable to us or our shareholders may be changed 

certain of our business activities are potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax or corporatelevel income tax 

under the internal revenue code reits generally must engage in the ownership and management of income producing real estate for the company this generally includes owning and managing a timberland portfolio for the production and sale of standing timber accordingly the manufacture and sale by us of wood products the harvesting and sale of logs and the development or sale of certain timberlands the manufacture and sale of pulp products the development of real estate the building and sale of singlefamily houses and the development and sale of land and lots for real estate development are conducted through one or more of our whollyowned taxable reit subsidiaries “trss” because such activities could generate nonqualifying reit income and could constitute “prohibited transactions” prohibited transactions are defined by the internal revenue code generally to be sales or other dispositions of property to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business by conducting our business in this manner we believe that we satisfy the reit requirements of the internal revenue code and are not subject to the 100 percent tax that could be imposed if a reit were to conduct a prohibited transaction we may not always be successful however in limiting such activities to our trss therefore we could be subject to the 100 percent prohibited transactions tax if such instances were to occur the net income of our trss is subject to corporatelevel income tax 

the extent of our use of our trs may affect the price of our common shares relative to the share price of other reits 

we conduct a significant portion of our business activities through one or more trss our use of our trss enables us to engage in nonreit qualifying business activities such as the sale of logs production and sale of wood products and pulp products real estate development and 

  weyerhaeuser company  2011 annual report and form 10k   25 

singlefamily home sales and sale of hbu property our trss are subject to corporatelevel tax therefore we pay income taxes on the income generated by our trss under the code no more than 25 percent of the value of the gross assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trs this limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our trss’ operations furthermore our use of trss may cause the market to value our common shares differently than the shares of other reits which may not use trss as extensively as we use them 

we may be limited in our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our taxable reit subsidiaries 

the ability of the reit to receive dividends from our trs is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a reit in particular at least 75 percent of gross income for each taxable year as a reit must be derived from passive real estate sources including sales of our standing timber and other types of qualifying real estate income and no more than 25 percent of our gross income may consist of dividends from our trs and other nonreal estate income 

this limitation on our ability to receive dividends from our trss may affect our ability to fund cash distributions to our shareholders using cash flows from our trss we can however under current law issue stock dividends for up to 90 percent of our regular dividend distribution for calendar years through 2011 the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed and income that is not distributed will not be subject to the reit income distribution requirement 

our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate 

generally reits are required to distribute 90 percent of their ordinary taxable income and 95 percent of their net capital gains income capital gains may be retained by the reit but would be subject to income taxes if capital gains are retained rather than distributed our shareholders would be notified and they would be deemed to have received a taxable distribution with a refundable credit for any federal income tax paid by the reit accordingly we believe that we are not required to distribute material amounts of cash since substantially all of our taxable income is treated as capital gains income our board of directors in its sole discretion determines the amount of quarterly dividends to be provided to our shareholders based on consideration of a number of factors these factors include but are not limited to our results of operations cash flow and capital requirements economic conditions tax considerations borrowing capacity and other factors including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments future acquisitions and divestitures harvest levels changes in the price and demand for our products and general market demand for timberlands including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses consequently our dividend levels may fluctuate 

we may not be able to complete desired likekind exchange transactions for timberlands and real estate we sell 

when we sell timberlands and real estate we generally seek to match these sales with the acquisition of suitable replacement timberlands this allows us “likekind exchange” treatment for these transactions under section 1031 and related regulations of the code this matching of sales and purchases provides us with significant tax benefits most importantly the deferral of any gain on the property sold until ultimate disposition of the replacement property while we attempt to complete likekind exchanges wherever practical we may not be able to do so in all instances due to various factors including the lack of availability of suitable replacement property on acceptable terms and our inability to complete a qualifying likekind exchange transaction within the time frames required by the code the inability to obtain likekind exchange treatment would result in the payment of taxes with respect to the property sold and a corresponding reduction in earnings and cash available for distribution to shareholders as dividends 

legal proceedings 

we are a party to a number of legal proceedings and adverse judgments in certain legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

the costs and other effects of pending litigation against us and related insurance recoveries cannot be determined with certainty although the disclosure in note 15 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies  of notes to consolidated financial statements  contains management’s current views of the effect such litigation will have on our financial results there can be no assurance that the outcome of such proceedings will be as expected 

for example there have been several lawsuits filed against us alleging that we violated us antitrust laws those included lawsuits alleging antitrust violations against us and other manufacturers of oriented strand board and lawsuits alleging antitrust violations with respect to alder logs and lumber all of these matters have been settled 

it is possible that there could be adverse judgments against us in some or all major litigation against us and that we could be required to take a charge for all or a portion of any damage award any such charge could materially and adversely affect our results of operations for the quarter or year in which we record it 

export taxes 

we may be required to pay significant export taxes or countervailing and antidumping duties for exported products 

we may experience reduced revenues and margins on some of our businesses as a result of export taxes or countervailing and antidumping duty applications for example in 2001 a group of companies filed petitions with the us department of commerce and the international trade commission claiming that production of softwood lumber in canada was being subsidized by canada and that imports into the us from canada were being sold in us markets at less than their fair value we have softwood lumber facilities in canada that export lumber into the us we paid a total of 370 million in deposits for countervailing duty and antidumping tariffs from 2002 through 2006 related to those lumber exports the us and canadian governments reached a settlement of the dispute in 2006 as a result of the settlement we received a refund of 344 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 however our canadian softwood lumber facilities will have to pay an export tax when the price of lumber is at or below a threshold price the export tax could be as high as 225 percent if a province exceeds its total allotted export share the us subsequently claimed that british columbia violated the 2006 agreement by downgrading timber in british columbias interior region to lower its price canada has responded to the claim which will be heard by the london court of international arbitration in march 2012 if the us claims are upheld our canadian operations could be subject to damage claims for as much as 15 million similar types of actions have been initiated from time to time against us and other us producers of products such as paper or lumber by countries such as china and korea it is possible that countervailing duty and antidumping tariffs or similar types of tariffs could be imposed on us in the future we may experience reduced revenues and margins in any business that is subject to such tariffs or to the terms of the settlements of such international disputes these tariffs or settlement terms could have a material adverse effect on our business financial results and financial condition including facility closures or impairments of assets

natural disasters 

our business and operations could be adversely affected by weather fire infestation or natural disasters 

our timberlands assets may be damaged by adverse weather severe wind and rainstorms fires pest infestation or other natural disasters because our manufacturing processes primarily use wood fiber in many cases from our own timberlands in the event of material damage to our timberlands our operations could be disrupted or our production costs could be increased 

southern yellow pine design values 

the demand for our southern yellow pine could be adversely affected by design value changes 

the southern pine inspection bureau spib submitted proposed design value changes to the american lumber standards committee alsc in 2011 for visually graded southern yellow pine lumber the proposed changes were the result of tests on southern yellow pine no 2 2x4 specimens that showed reductions in certain design values our southern timberlands predominantly contain southern yellow pine we sell both visually graded and mechanically graded southern yellow pine under the spib proposal design values for mechanically graded lumber would not change the alsc held two public hearings on the matter and the results of the tests on january 11 2012 the alsc board of review approved new design values for southern yellow pine 2x4 lumber of grade no 2 and lower with a recommended effective date of june 1 2012 but declined to approve design value changes for other sizes further testing and analysis of other sizes of southern yellow pine is expected to be completed later in 2012 it is unknown whether the testing of other sizes will result in a spib proposal for additional design value changes or what changes the alsc board of review would make or the timing for their implementation if changes were proposed the design value reductions for visually graded southern yellow pine 2x4s of grade no 2 and lower and the possibility of additional design value reductions for other widths could result in an increase in product substitution or species substitution and could adversely affect demand for visually graded southern yellow pine 



stockprice volatility 

the price of our common stock may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors some of which are beyond our control including those described above under risks related to our industries and business and the following 

 in addition there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in the forest products industry that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 

some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them if litigation of this type is brought against us it could result in substantial costs and would divert management’s attention and resources 

unresolved staff comments 

there are no unresolved comments that were received from the sec staff relating to our periodic or current reports under the securities exchange act of 1934

to implement our decision to be taxed as a reit we distributed to our shareholders our accumulated earnings and profits determined under federal income tax provisions as a “special dividend” on september 1 2010 we paid a dividend of 56 billion which included the special dividend and the regular quarterly dividend of approximately 11 million at the election of each shareholder the special dividend was paid in cash or weyerhaeuser common shares the number of common shares issued was approximately 324 million the stock portion of the special dividend was treated as the issuance of new shares for accounting purposes and affects our earnings per share only for periods after the distribution prior periods are not restated the required treatment results in earnings per share that is less than would have been the case had the common shares not been issued see note 4 net earnings loss per share  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for pro forma results giving effect to the common stock distribution for diluted earnings per common share as if the common stock distribution had occurred at the beginning of each period

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda 



  

our mda includes the following major sections 

 



in 2011 the us economy slowed its pace of recovery the underlying causes included the japan earthquake and tsunami the us deficit and related political instability and european debt crisis these factors weighed heavily on the economy delaying many anticipated improvements in key economic indicators the us housing market continues to be affected by these events and consequently lags other sectors in the recovery improvement in the latter part of 2011 in key areas such as job creation industrial production and gdp may help spur growth in us housing however the sector remains burdened by excess inventory and a diminished pool of qualified home buyers the health of the us housing market strongly affects our real estate wood products and timberlands segments real estate focuses on building single family homes wood products primarily sells into the new residential building and repair and remodel markets demand for logs from our timberlands segment is affected by the production of woodbased building products as well as export demand cellulose fibers is primarily affected by global demand and the relative strength of the us dollar 

housing market 

we track certain indicators such as employment consumer confidence housing starts home sales foreclosures home prices mortgage interest rates and the number of homes for sale to assess housing market conditions the following market statements refer to industry conditions in general and not to weyerhaeuser operations directly 

total us housing starts for 2011 were 606 thousand units with single family units accounting for 429 thousand of the total this represents a 9 percent decline in single family starts from 2010 however demand for homes was bolstered by government programs such as the new home buyer tax credit for part of the year in 2010 these programs were not renewed in 2011 multifamily construction did relatively better in 2011 compared with 2010 averaging 177 thousand units compared with 114 thousand in 2010 in total current housing demand remains well below 1 million or more single family starts the typical level during the 15year period of 19922007 new home sales in the us totaled 303 thousand units in 2011 this level of new home sales is 6 percent lower than 2010 and lower than any year recorded since 1963 when us census started reporting this data through much of 2011 the unemployment rate has remained above 9 percent but as of december had fallen to 85 percent the lowest level for the year weak employment growth contributed to weak consumer confidence limiting any growth in demand for housing and wood products the number of mortgages in default remains very large and the number of foreclosures is expected to remain high relative to historic trends this will continue to contribute to the inventory of existing homes for sale which limits demand for new homes 

demand for wood products continued to be affected by the depressed level of new home construction in 2011 overall demand levels for lumber increased 3 percent from 2010 while demand for oriented strand board osb which is more heavily dependent on residential construction increased 15 percent from 2010 levels demand for both lumber and osb remain 35 percent to 40 percent below peak levels as a result industry operating rates for lumber and osb have averaged between 70 and 80 percent of capacity prices for some commodity wood products were modestly higher in 2011 while others such as southern yellow pine lumber and osb were lower in 2011 than in 2010 in 2011 most prices peaked in the second quarter coinciding with the strongest quarter of construction but decreased to levels closer to their costs of production for much of the year demand for logs increased as lumber production increased slightly in the western region weak domestic demand for logs was offset by demand from japan china and korea resulting in significant increases in western log prices in 2011 

us dollarglobal demand 

the us dollar remained weak relative to most developed world currencies during 2011 cellulose fibers benefited from the decline in the value of the us dollar as our pulp mills became more competitive compared to european canadian and south american producers the combination of the weaker dollar steady global demand and flat capacity helped prices for the key indicator northern bleached softwood kraft nbsk pulp to remain above 950ton in 2011 2 percent higher than in 2010 pulp prices started the year similar to 2010 peaking in the second quarter and then declining into the fourth quarter largely as a result of a weakening euro debt concerns in the eurozone countries has lowered the value of the euro relative to the us dollar reducing the competiveness of us producers relative to european competitors causing a decline in the key nbsk indicator price in the fourth quarter 

the weaker dollar compared to the yen resulted in us logs being less expensive to importers in japan although japan experienced a major disruption with the earthquake and tsunami in march 2011 total housing starts in japan increased 3 percent from 2010 levels as rebuilding efforts began in the second half of the year the export log market was affected by increased demand from china chinese imports of softwood logs from the us were estimated to exceed 5 million cubic meters for 2011 double the level from 2010 

  weyerhaeuser company  2011 annual report and form 10k   31 

where we are headed 

growth in the us economy improved to 28 percent in fourth quarter 2011 compared to 18 percent in third quarter 2011 and that momentum is expected to continue into 2012 job growth also has shown gradual improvement in the latter part of 2011 and the us is expected to add enough jobs to lower the overall unemployment rate in 2012 singlefamily starts are expected to gradually increase in 2012 a result of improving demand for homes and record low inventory of new homes for sale demand for wood products is expected to increase as a result of greater demand for housing however sustainable demand growth is expected to be modest in 2012 as a result prices in 2012 are expected to be similar to 2011 log prices in western markets are expected to remain flat exclusive of seasonal swings in the south log prices are also expected to remain flat but at lower levels than the west which benefits from strong demand from asia the us dollar is expected to remain weak relative to developed currencies outside of the euro which is expected to continue to be affected by uncertainty in the eurozone weakness in the euro is expected to undermine the competitive position of us market pulp producers and will likely put downward pressure on prices 



starting with our 2010 fiscal year we elected to be taxed as a reit we expect to derive most of our reit income from investments in timberlands including the sale of standing timber through payascut sales contracts reit income can be distributed to shareholders without first paying corporate level tax substantially eliminating the double taxation on income a significant portion of our timberland segment earnings receives this favorable tax treatment we are however subject to corporate taxes on builtingains the excess of fair market value over tax basis at january 1 2010 on sales of real property other than standing timber held by the reit during the first 10 years following the reit conversion we continue to be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on earnings of our taxable reit subsidiary trs which principally includes our manufacturing businesses our real estate development business and our nonqualified timberland segment income following are points related to our conversion

critical accounting policies 

our critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and estimates they also have a high degree of complexity 

in accounting we base our judgments and estimates on 

 actual results however may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded 

our most critical accounting policies relate to our 

 details about our other significant accounting policies — what we use and how we estimate — are in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  weyerhaeuser company  2011 annual report and form 10k   46 

pension and postretirement benefit plans 

we sponsor several pension and postretirement benefit plans for our employees key assumptions we use in accounting for the plans include our 

 at the end of every year we review our assumptions with external advisers and make adjustments as appropriate actual experience that differs from our assumptions or any changes in our assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

other factors that affect our accounting for the plans include 

 this section provides more information about our 

 expected longterm rate of return 

plan assets are assets of the pension plan trusts that fund the benefits provided under the pension plans the expected longterm rate of return is our estimate of the longterm rate of return that our plan assets will earn our expected longterm rate of return is important in determining the net income or expense we recognize for our plans 

after considering available information at the end of 2011  we reduced our expected longterm rate of return from 95 percent to 90 percent factors we considered include 

 the revised rate will affect the amount of net periodic benefit costs that we record in 2012 every 05 percent decrease in our expected longterm rate of return would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately 

 likewise every 05 percent increase in our expected longterm rate of return would decrease expense or increase a credit by those same amounts 

the actual return on plan assets in any given year may vary from our expected longterm rate of return actual returns on plan assets affect the funded status of the plans differences between actual returns on plan assets and the expected longterm rate of return are reflected as adjustments to cumulative other comprehensive income loss a component of total equity 

discount rates 

our discount rates as of december 31 2011  are 

 we review our discount rates annually and revise them as needed the discount rates are selected at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of highquality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits 

pension and postretirement benefit expenses for 2012  will be based on the 45 percent  and 41 percent  assumed discount rates for us plans and the 49 percent  and 48 percent  assumed discount rates for the canadian plans 

our discount rates are important in determining the cost of our plans a 05 percent decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately 

 contributions made and benefits paid 

during 2011  

   weyerhaeuser company  2011 annual report and form 10k   47 

during 2012  

based on estimated yearend assets and projections of plan liabilities we expect to 

 longlived assets 

we review the carrying value of our longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations the carrying value is the amount assigned to longlived assets in our books 

an impairment occurs when the carrying value of longlived assets will not be recovered from future cash flows and is more than fair market value fair market value is the estimated amount we would receive if we were to sell the assets 

in determining fair market value and whether impairment has occurred we are required to estimate 

 key assumptions we use in developing the estimates include 

 impairment of longlived assets real estate 

we review homebuilding longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable we recorded longlived homebuilding asset impairments and related charges attributable to weyerhaeuser shareholders of 11 million in 2011 21 million in 2010 and 261 million in 2009 

real estate in process of development and land being processed for development 

real estate in process of development and land being processed for development includes subdivisions and master planned communities mpcs mpcs typically include several product segments such as residential active adult retail and commercial we evaluate impairment at the subdivision or mpc product segment level factors that are considered when evaluating a subdivision or mpc product segment for impairment include 

 we update the undiscounted cash flow forecast for each subdivision and mpc product segment that may be impaired the undiscounted cash flow forecasts are affected by communityspecific factors that include 

 the carrying amount of each subdivision and mpc product segment is written down to fair value when the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of a subdivision or mpc product segment an impairment charge for a subdivision or mpc product segment is allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot 

real estate for sale 

real estate for sale includes homes that have been completed and land that we intend to sell we regularly sell land or lots that do not fit our value proposition or development plans 

the carrying amount of real estate for sale is reduced to fair value less estimated costs to sell if the forecasted net proceeds are less than the carrying amount the fair value analysis is affected by local market economic conditions demographic factors and competitor actions and is inherently uncertain actual net proceeds can differ from the estimates the carrying amount of real estate for sale is evaluated quarterly 

market approach 

we use the market approach to determine fair value of real estate assets when information for comparable assets is available this approach is commonly used for completed inventory and individual assets for sale we typically use 

   weyerhaeuser company  2011 annual report and form 10k   48 

income approach 

we generally use the income approach to determine fair value of real estate for our inactive projects and assets in process of development the income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example cash flows or earnings to a single present amount discounted the fair value measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations regarding those future estimated cash inflows and outflows we use present value techniques based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams discount rates applied to the estimated future cash flows of our homebuilding assets in 2011 ranged from 15 percent to 18 percent the income approach relies on management judgment regarding the various inputs to the undiscounted cash flow forecasts 

contingent liabilities 

we are subject to lawsuits investigations and other claims related to environmental product and other matters and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 

we record contingent liabilities when 

 assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors including 

 in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that an ultimate loss may occur 

while we do our best in developing our projections recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain if estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges in other income expense net these exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flow in any given quarter or year see note 15 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for more information 

depletion 

we record depletion — the costs attributed to timber harvested — as trees are harvested 

to calculate our depletion rate which is updated annually we 

 estimating the volume of timber available for harvest over the harvest cycle requires the consideration of the following factors 

 in addition the length of the harvest cycle varies by geographic region and species of timber 

depletionrate calculations do not include estimates for 

 

prospective accounting pronouncements 

currently there are no significant prospective accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a material impact on us

note 1   summary of significant accounting policies   

our significant accounting policies describe 

 our election to be taxed as a real estate investment trust reit 

starting with our 2010 fiscal year we elected to be taxed as a reit we expect to derive most of our reit income from investments in timberlands including the sale of standing timber through payascut sales contracts reit income can be distributed to shareholders without first paying corporate level tax substantially eliminating the double taxation on income a significant portion of our timberland segment earnings receives this favorable tax treatment we are however subject to corporate taxes on builtingains the excess of fair market value over tax basis at january 1 2010 on sales of real property other than standing timber held by the reit during the first 10 years following the reit conversion we continue to be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on earnings of our taxable reit subsidiary trs which principally includes our manufacturing businesses our real estate development business and our nonqualified timberland segment income 

how we report our results 

our report includes 

 consolidated financial statements 

our consolidated financial statements provide an overall view of our results and financial condition they include our accounts and the accounts of entities that we control including 

 they do not include our intercompany transactions and accounts which are eliminated and noncontrolling interests are presented as a separate component of equity 

we account for investments in and advances to unconsolidated equity affiliates using the equity method with taxes provided on undistributed earnings this means that we record earnings and accrue taxes in the period that the earnings are recorded by our unconsolidated equity affiliates 

we report our financial condition in two groups 

 throughout these notes to consolidated financial statements unless specified otherwise references to “weyerhaeuser” “we” and “our” refer to the consolidated company including both forest products and real estate 

our business segments 

we are principally engaged in 

 our business segments are organized based primarily on products and services 

  weyerhaeuser company  2011 annual report and form 10k   55 

our business segments and products 



we also transfer raw materials semifinished materials and end products among our business segments because of this intracompany activity accounting for our business segments involves 

 foreign currency translation 

local currencies are the functional currencies for most of our operations outside the us we translate foreign currencies into us dollars in two ways 

 estimates 

we prepare our financial statements according to us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap this requires us to make estimates and assumptions during our reporting periods and at the date of our financial statements the estimates and assumptions affect our 

 while we do our best in preparing these estimates actual results can and do differ from those estimates and assumptions 

changes in how we report our results 

changes in how we report our results come from 

 reclassifications 

we have reclassified certain balances and results from the prior years to be consistent with our 2011  reporting this makes yeartoyear comparisons easier our reclassifications had no effect on net earnings loss or weyerhaeuser shareholders’ interest the reclassifications include changes to the way we classify certain transactions as operating investing or financing on our consolidated statement of cash flows  and to present the results of operations discontinued in 2011 separately on our consolidated statement of operations  note 3 discontinued operations  provides information about our discontinued operations 

how we account for various items 

this section provides information about how we account for certain key items related to 

 items related to capital investments 

key items related to accounting for capital investments pertain to property and equipment timber and timberlands impairment of longlived assets and goodwill 

property and equipment 

we maintain property accounts on an individual asset basis here’s how we handle major items 

   weyerhaeuser company  2011 annual report and form 10k   56 

timber and timberlands 

we carry timber and timberlands at cost less depletion charged to disposals depletion refers to the carrying value of timber that is harvested lost as a result of casualty or sold 

key activities affecting how we account for timber and timberlands include 

 reforestation  generally we capitalize initial site preparation and planting costs as reforestation we transfer reforestation to a merchantable timber classification when the timber is considered harvestable that generally occurs after 

 generally we expense costs after the first planting as they are incurred or over the period of expected benefit these costs include 

 accounting practices for these costs do not change when timber becomes merchantable and harvesting starts 

depletion  to determine depletion rates we divide the net carrying value of timber by the related volume of timber estimated to be available over the growth cycle to determine the growth cycle volume of timber we consider 

 we include the cost of timber harvested in the carrying values of raw materials and product inventories as these inventories are sold to third parties we include them in the cost of products sold 

forest management in canada  we hold forest management licenses in various canadian provinces that are 

 calculation of the fees we pay on the timber we harvest 

 impairment of longlived assets 

we review longlived assets — including certain identifiable intangibles — for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable impaired assets held for use are written down to fair value impaired assets held for sale are written down to fair value less cost to sell we determine fair value based on 

 goodwill 

goodwill is the purchase price minus the fair value of net assets acquired when we buy another entity we assess goodwill for impairment 

 in 2011  the fair value of the reporting unit with goodwill substantially exceeded its carrying value 

fair value measurements 

we use a fair value hierarchy in accounting for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities including 

 the fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or unobservable observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect a reporting entity’s pricing based upon its own market assumptions 

  weyerhaeuser company  2011 annual report and form 10k   57 

the fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels 

 – quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market 

– quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or 

– inputs other than quoted prices that are observable and marketcorroborated inputs which are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 

 items related to financing our business 

key items related to financing our business include financial instruments cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable 

financial instruments 

we estimate the fair value of financial instruments where appropriate the assumptions we use — including the discount rate and estimates of cash flows — can significantly affect our fairvalue amounts our fair values are estimates and may not match the amounts we would realize upon sale or settlement of our financial positions 

cash and cash equivalents 

cash equivalents are investments with original maturities of 90  days or less we state cash equivalents at cost which approximates market 

accounts payable 

our banking system replenishes our major bank accounts daily as checks we have issued are presented for payment as a result we have negative book cash balances due to outstanding checks that have not yet been paid by the bank these negative balances are included in accounts payable on our consolidated balance sheet  changes in these negative cash balances are reported as financing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows  negative book cash balances were 

 items related to operations 

key items related to operations include revenue recognition inventories shipping and handling costs income taxes sharebased compensation pension and other postretirement plans and environmental remediation 

revenue recognition 

forest products operations generally recognize revenue upon shipment to customers for certain export sales revenue is recognized when title transfers at the foreign port 

real estate operations recognize revenue when 

 inventories 

we state inventories at the lower of cost or market cost includes labor materials and production overhead we use lifo — the lastin firstout method — for certain of our domestic raw material inprocess and finished goods inventories our lifo inventories were 

 we use fifo — the firstin firstout method — or moving average cost methods for the balance of our domestic raw materials and product inventories as well as for all material and supply inventories and all foreign inventories if we used fifo for all inventories our stated product inventories would have been higher by 

 shipping and handling costs 

we classify shipping and handling costs in the costs of products sold in our consolidated statement of operations  

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method unrecognized tax benefits represent potential future funding obligations to taxing authorities if uncertain tax positions the company has taken on previously filed tax returns are not sustained in accordance with the company’s accounting policy accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect 

   weyerhaeuser company  2011 annual report and form 10k   58 

to measure deferred tax assets and liabilities we 

 sharebased compensation 

we generally measure the fair value of sharebased awards on the dates they are granted or modified these measurements establish the cost of the sharebased awards for accounting purposes we then recognize the cost of sharebased awards in our consolidated statement of operations  over each employee’s required service period note 17 sharebased compensation  provides more information about our sharebased compensation 

pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

we recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on our consolidated balance sheet  and recognize changes in the funded status through comprehensive income loss in the year in which the changes occur 

actuarial valuations determine the amount of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit cost we recognize the net periodic benefit cost includes 

 pension plans  we have pension plans covering most of our employees determination of benefits differs for salaried hourly and union employees 

 we contribute to our us and canadian pension plans according to established funding standards the funding standards for the plans are 

 postretirement benefits other than pensions  we provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for some retired employees in some cases we pay a portion of the cost of the benefit note 8 pension and other postretirement benefit plans  provides additional information about changes made in our postretirement benefit plans during 2011  and 2010  

environmental remediation 

we accrue losses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when the recovery is deemed probable and does not exceed the amount of losses previously recorded 

note 2   business segments   

our business segments and how we account for those segments are discussed in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  this note provides key financial data by business segment 

discontinued operations 

we have disposed of various businesses and operations that are excluded in the segment results below see note 3 discontinued operations  for information regarding our discontinued operations and the segments affected

sale of hardwoods 

on august 1 2011  we completed the sale of our hardwoods operations to american industrial partners for consideration of 109 million  of which 25 million  is a note receivable during second quarter 2011 we reduced our hardwoods assets to their fair value less selling costs which resulted in the recognition of a 9 million  charge an additional 10 million  pension curtailment charge was recognized in third quarter 2011 when the transaction closed total pretax charges on the sale of 22 million  were recorded in our wood products segment we recognized a tax benefit on the sale of 8 million  resulting in a yeartodate net loss of 14 million  

the following operating assets were included as part of the transaction

note 4   net earnings loss per share   

our basic earnings loss per share attributable to weyerhaeuser shareholders for the last three years were 

 our diluted earnings loss per share attributable to weyerhaeuser shareholders for the last three years were 

 this note discloses 

 how we calculate basic and diluted net earnings per share 

“basic earnings” per share is net earnings divided by the weighted average number of our outstanding common shares 

“diluted earnings” per share is net earnings divided by the sum of the

 we use the treasury stock method to calculate the effect of our outstanding dilutive potential common shares sharebased payment awards that are contingently issuable upon the achievement of specified performance or market conditions are included in our diluted earnings per share calculation in the period in which the conditions are satisfied 

to implement our decision to be taxed as a reit we distributed to our shareholders our accumulated earnings and profits determined under federal income tax provisions as a “special dividend” on september 1 2010  we paid a dividend of 56 billion  which included the special dividend and the regular quarterly dividend of approximately 11 million  at the election of each shareholder the special dividend was paid in cash or weyerhaeuser common shares the number of common shares issued was approximately 324 million the stock portion of the special dividend was treated as the issuance of new shares for accounting purposes and affects our earnings per share only for periods after the distribution prior periods are not restated the required treatment results in earnings per share that is less than would have been the case had the common shares not been issued reflected below are pro forma results giving effect to the common stock distribution for diluted earnings per common share as if the common stock distribution had occurred at the beginning of the period

shares excluded from dilutive effect 

the following shares were not included in the computation of diluted earnings loss per share because they were antidilutive however some or all of these shares may be dilutive potential common shares in future periods 

potential shares not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share 



the increase in options in 2010 is primarily due to our longterm incentive compensation plan requiring outstanding stock options to be adjusted as a result of the special dividend the number of awards increased by a ratio of the closing price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange on july 19 2010 to the opening price on july 20 2010

effects of significant transactions and events 

the information that is provided in this footnote is affected by the following transactions and events 

amendments of pension and other postretirement benefit plans for salaried employees 

pension benefit plan amendments 

during fourth quarter 2011 we ratified an amendment to the weyerhaeuser pension plan that eliminated the retiree medical enhancement for active employees effective july 1 2012 this change reduced the plans projected benefit obligation by 16 million  this change was announced to affected participants during january 2012 

effective december 31 2010 the weyerhaeuser company retirement plan for hourly rated employees was merged into the weyerhaeuser company retirement plan for salaried employees resulting in the weyerhaeuser pension plan there were no  changes to the provisions as a result of the plan merger 

  weyerhaeuser company  2011 annual report and form 10k   62 

during third quarter 2009 we announced changes to the weyerhaeuser company retirement plan for salaried employees for service earned on and after january 1 2010 the changes included a reduced pension benefit changes in how benefits payable before age 65 are determined and a change from a single lump sum optional form of payment to an option for seven equal annual installments there were no  changes in the plan’s projected benefit obligation pbo for the 2009 plan year as a result of these changes however there was a change to the plan’s minimum benefit which increased for all years of service including those earned prior to january 1 2010 this change did not have a significant effect on the plan’s pbo but the change was reflected in the pbo at december 31 2009 and prior service cost was established as of december 31 2009 all of the changes affected net periodic pension benefit credits costs and required funding beginning in 2010 

postretirement medical and life insurance benefit plan amendments 

during fourth quarter 2011 we ratified amendments to our postretirement medical and life insurance benefit plans for us salaried employees that reduced or eliminated certain medical and life insurance benefits that were available to both past and present employees the changes included the elimination of the premedicare plan ii company subsidy for those not enrolled as of july 1 2012 and eliminated the postmedicare health reimbursement account hra for those not enrolled or medicare eligible if enrolled as of july 1 2012 these changes resulted in a 108 million  reduction in the companys postretirement liability as of december 31 2011 these changes were announced to affected participants during january 2012 

during third quarter 2010 we made changes to our postretirement medical plan for certain retirees in the us specifically medicare eligible retirees will be covered by a health reimbursement account hra as of january 1 2011 the hra will allow these retirees to purchase coverage through a healthcare exchange and will provide additional options for coverage as a result of this plan change the company will not be receiving a medicare part d subsidy for plan years beginning on or after january 1 2011 the loss of medicare part d subsidy is considered in the calculation of the net prior service credit of 3 million  resulting from the plan change this amount will be amortized into the net periodic benefit costs credits over the life expectancy of the affected plan participants 

during third quarter 2009 amendments were approved for our postretirement medical and life insurance benefits for certain retirees and employees covered by plans in canada the changes to the canadian plans included a decrease in the amounts paid for postretirement medical and life insurance for certain retirees and employees as a result of the plan changes the plans’ liabilities were remeasured at august 31 2009 the remeasurement and the annual remeasurement at january 1 2009 reduced the unrecognized gain by 19 million  the plan changes also generated an unrecognized prior service credit of 97 million  which will be amortized into net periodic benefit costs credits over the remaining future service years of plan members 

during fourth quarter 2009 an amendment was approved for our postretirement life insurance benefit for certain us salaried retirees the change eliminated the life insurance benefit for certain salaried retirees effective january 1 2010 the plan’s liabilities were remeasured at november 30 2009 this remeasurement and the annual remeasurement at january 1 2009 increased the unrecognized loss by 6 million  this change resulted in a 16 million  prior service credit which was fully recognized in 2009 

restructuring activities 

the information that is provided in this footnote is affected by restructuring activities that occurred in 2011 2010 and 2009 

2011 restructuring 

the 2011 curtailments and special termination benefits are related to involuntary terminations due to companywide restructuring activities and the sale of our hardwoods and westwood shipping lines operations the total curtailment charge for us pension plans was 9 million  in addition we recognized a 3 million  settlement charge for a canadian pension plan in fourth quarter 2011 there were no  curtailment charges or credits to the us or canadian postretirement plans 

termination benefits were provided under the pension plan in the us for those terminated employees who were not yet eligible to retire but whose age plus service was at least 65 and had at least ten years of service rule of 65 special termination charges were 6 million  

2010 restructuring 

the 2010 curtailments and special termination benefits are related to involuntary terminations due to companywide restructuring activities the closure of wood products facilities and the sale of five short line railroads the total curtailment charge for us pension plans was 5 million  there were no  curtailment charges or credits to the canadian pension plans or the us or canadian postretirement plans 

termination benefits were provided under the pension plan in the us for those terminated employees who were not yet eligible to retire but whose age plus service was at least 65 and had at least ten years of service rule of 65 special termination charges were 5 million  

2009 restructuring 

the cumulative lump sum distributions for the year triggered two settlements in the us settlement charges of 60 million  and 16 million  were recognized in third and fourth quarter 2009 respectively 

the 2009 curtailments and special termination benefits were related to involuntary terminations due to companywide restructuring activities and the closure of wood products facilities the total curtailment charge for the us and canadian pension plans was 22 million  the net curtailment credit to the canadian postretirement benefit plans was less than 1 million  there were no  curtailment charges or credits to the us postretirement plans 

termination benefits were available under both the pension and postretirement benefit plans in the us and canada for those terminated employees who were not yet eligible to retire but whose age plus service was at least 65 and had at least ten years of service rule of 65 special termination charges were 14 million  and 9 million  for the pension and postretirement benefit plans respectively 

midyear remeasurement of assets and liabilities 

our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are only remeasured at fiscal yearend unless a significant event occurs that requires remeasurement of the assets or liabilities at an interim date there were no significant events that triggered remeasurement in 2011 and 2010 

during 2009 the following events required interim re­measurements 

   weyerhaeuser company  2011 annual report and form 10k   63 

 the discount rate used to remeasure the plans’ liabilities is reflective of current bond rates on the remeasurement date as a result of the midyear remeasurements multiple discount rates were used in estimating our net periodic benefit cost credit for 2009 these rates are discussed further in the actuarial assumptions portion of this footnote 

receivable from pension trust 

during 2009 and 2008 there was a high volume of lump sum distributions from our us qualified pension plans retirementeligible employees whose employment with the company terminated in connection with the sale of our containerboard packaging and recycling business or corporate restructuring activities could elect to receive their pension benefit as a lump sum distribution if permitted in accordance with the plans’ provisions in addition market events in late 2008 and early 2009 adversely affected liquidity for instance many of the funds in which plan assets are invested changed their redemption terms which delayed some of the pension trusts’ cash receipts to avoid liquidating assets at depressed prices and as permitted by law we elected to provide 285 million  of shortterm liquidity to the us pension trust through shortterm loans these shortterm loans were made in 2008 and first quarter 2009 the pension trust repaid 139 million  in fourth quarter 2009 and the remaining 146 million  in 2010 

funded status of plans we sponsor 

the funded status of the plans we sponsor is determined by comparing the projected benefit obligation with the fair value of plan assets at the end of the year 

changes in projected benefit obligations of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 



changes in fair value of plan assets 



  weyerhaeuser company  2011 annual report and form 10k   64 

funded status of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 



our qualified and registered pension plans and a portion of our nonregistered pension plans are funded we contribute to these plans according to established funding standards the nonqualified pension plan a portion of the nonregistered pension plans and the other postretirement benefit plans are unfunded for the unfunded plans we pay benefits to retirees from our general assets as they come due 

the values reported for our pension plan assets at the end of 2011  and 2010  were estimated additional information regarding the yearend values generally becomes available to us during the first half of the following year we increased the fair value of plan assets by 138 million  to reflect final valuations as of december 31 2010  

during 2011  we contributed 78 million  to our canadian registered plan and 25 million  to our nonqualified and nonregistered plans 

the asset or liability on our consolidated balance sheet  representing the funded status of the plans is different from the cumulative income or expense that we have recorded related to these plans these differences are actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and credits that are deferred and will be amortized into our periodic benefit costs in future periods these unamortized amounts are recorded in cumulative other comprehensive income which is a component of total equity on our consolidated balance sheet  

changes in amounts included in cumulative other comprehensive income 



during 2010 we reversed net tax benefits related to pension and other postretirement benefit loss and prior service credit not yet recognized in earnings by 43 million  as a result of our conversion to a reit we also reduced our estimated tax rate which increased actuarial net losses and prior service credit net of tax by 34 million  

accumulated benefit obligations greater than plan assets 

as of december 31 2011  pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations greater than plan assets had 

 as of december 31 2010  pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations greater than plan assets had 

 the accumulated benefit obligation for all of our defined benefit pension plans was

pension assets 

our investment policies and strategies 

our investment policies and strategies guide and direct how we manage funds for the benefit plans we sponsor these funds include our 

 us and canadian pension trusts 

our us pension trust holds the funds for our us qualified pension plans while our canadian pension trust holds the funds for our canadian registered pension plans 

our strategy within the trusts is to invest 

 consistent with past practice and in accordance with investment guidelines established by the company’s investment committee the investment managers of the company’s pension plan asset portfolios utilize a diversified set of investment strategies 

our direct investments include 

 our indirect investments include 

 the overall return for our pension trusts includes 

 cash and shortterm investments generally consist of highly liquid money market and government securities and are primarily held to fund benefit payments capital calls and margin requirements 

hedge fund investments generally consist of privatelyoffered managed pools primarily structured as limited liability entities with the general members or partners of such limited liability entities serving as portfolio manager and thus being responsible for the fund’s underlying investment decisions generally these funds have varying degrees of liquidity and redemption provisions underlying investments within these funds may include long and short public and private equities corporate mortgage and sovereign debt options swaps forwards and other derivative positions these funds may also use varying degrees of leverage 

private equity investments consist of investments in private equity mezzanine distressed coinvestments and other structures private equity funds generally participate in buyouts and venture capital of limited liability entities   through unlisted equity and debt instruments these funds may also employ borrowing at the underlying entity level mezzanine and distressed funds generally follow strategies of investing in the debt of public or private companies with additional participation through warrants or other equity type options 

real estate fund investments in real property may be initiated through private transactions between principals or public market vehicles such as real estate investment trusts and are generally held in limited liability entities 

common and preferred stocks are equity instruments that generally have resulted from transactions related to private equity investment holdings 

swaps and other derivative instruments generally are comprised of swaps futures forwards or options in accordance with our investment risk and return objectives some of these instruments are utilized to achieve target equity and bond asset exposure or to reduce exposure to certain market risks or to help manage the liquidity of our investments the resulting asset mix achieved is intended to allow the assets to perform comparably with established benchmarks others mainly total return swaps with limited exchange of principal are designed to gain exposure to the return characteristics of specific financial strategies 

all swap forward and option contracts are executed in a diversified manner through a number of financial institutions and in accordance with our investment guidelines 

retirement compensation arrangements 

retirement compensation arrangements fund a portion of our canadian nonregistered pension plans 

under retirement compensation arrangements our contributions are split 

 the canadian tax rules requirement means that — on average over time — approximately 50 percent of our canadian nonregistered pension plans’ assets do not earn returns 

  weyerhaeuser company  2011 annual report and form 10k   66 

managing risk 

investments and contracts in general are subject to risk including market price liquidity currency interest rate and credit risks we have established governance practices to manage certain risks the following provides an overview of these risks and describes actions we take to mitigate the potential adverse effects of these risks on the performance of our pension plan assets generally we manage these risks through 

 market price risk  is the risk that the future value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in its market price whether caused by factors specific to the individual investment its issuer or any other market factor that may affect its price we attempt to mitigate market price risk on the company’s pension plan asset portfolios by investing in a diversified set of assets whose returns exhibit low correlation to those of traditional asset classes and each other in addition we and our investment advisers monitor the investments on a regular basis to ensure the decision to invest in particular assets continues to be suitable including performing ongoing qualitative and quantitative assessments and comprehensive investment and operational due diligence special attention is paid to organizational changes made by the underlying fund managers and to changes in policy relative to their investment objectives valuation hedging strategy degree of diversification leverage alignment of fund principles and investors risk governance and costs 

liquidity risk  is the risk that the pension trusts will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with their financial liabilities our financial obligations as they relate to the pension plans may consist of distributions and redemptions payable to pension plan participants payments to counterparties and fees to service providers as established pension plan assets primarily consist of investments in limited liability pools for which there is no active secondary market as a result the investments may be illiquid further hedge funds are subject to potential restrictions that may affect the timing of the realization of pending redemptions private equity funds are subject to distribution and funding schedules that are set by the private equity funds’ respective managers and market activity to mitigate liquidity risk on the company’s pension plan asset portfolios the hedge fund portfolios have been diversified across manager’s strategies and funds that possess varying liquidity provisions and the private equity portfolios have been diversified across different vintage years and strategies in addition the investment committee regularly reviews cash flows of the pension trusts and sets appropriate guidelines to address liquidity needs 

currency risk  arises from holding pension plan assets denominated in a currency other than the currency in which its liabilities are settled such risk is managed generally through notional contracts designed to hedge the net exposure to nonfunctional currencies 

interest rate risk  is the risk that a change in interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of fixed income securities the pension trust’s primary exposure to interest rate risk is indirect and through their investments in limited liability pools such indirect exposure is managed by the respective fund managers in conjunction with their investment level decisions and predefined investment mandates 

credit risk  relates to the extent to which failures by counterparties to discharge their obligations could reduce the amount of future cash flows on hand at the balance sheet date the pension trusts’ exposure to counterparty credit risk is reflected as settlement receivables from derivative contracts within the pension plan assets in evaluating credit risk we will often be dependent upon information provided by the counterparty or a rating agency which may be inaccurate we decrease exposure to credit risk by only dealing with highlyrated financial counterparties and as of yearend our counterparties each had a credit rating of at least a from standard and poor’s 

we further manage this risk through 

 we expect that none of our counterparties will fail to meet its obligations also no principal is at risk as a result of these types of investments only the amount of unsettled net receivables is at risk 

we are also exposed to credit risk indirectly through counterparty relationships struck by the underlying managers of investments in limited liability pools this indirect exposure is mitigated through a due diligence process which focuses on monitoring each investment fund to ensure the decision to invest in or maintain exposure to a fund continues to be suitable for the pension plans’ asset portfolios 

while we do not target specific direct investment or derivative allocations we have established guidelines on the percentage of pension trust assets that can be invested in certain categories to provide diversification by investment type fund and investment managers as well as to manage overall liquidity 

assets within our qualified and registered pension plans in our us and canadian pension trusts were invested as follows 



  weyerhaeuser company  2011 annual report and form 10k   67 

for our nonregistered plans we invest 50 percent of the funds we contribute to our nonregistered pension plans under canadian tax rules for retirement compensation arrangements the other 50 percent is allocated to a noninterestbearing refundable tax account held by the canada revenue agency we have invested the assets that we are allowed to manage as follows 



valuation of our plan assets 

the pension assets are stated at fair value based upon the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date we do not value pension investments based upon a forced or distressed sale scenario instead we consider both observable and unobservable inputs that reflect assumptions applied by market participants when setting the exit price of an asset   or liability in an orderly transaction within the principal market of that asset or liability 

we value the pension plan assets based upon the observability of exit pricing inputs and classify pension plan assets based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the pension plan assets in their entirety the fair value hierarchy we follow is outlined below 

level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities traded in an active market 

level 2 inputs are quoted prices in nonactive markets for which pricing inputs are observable either directly or indirectly at the reporting date 

level 3 inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable 

the pension assets are comprised of cash and shortterm investments derivative contracts common and preferred stock and fund units the fund units are typically limited liability interests in hedge funds private equity funds real estate funds and cash funds each of these assets participates in its own unique principal market 

cash and shortterm investments when held directly are valued at cost 

common and preferred stocks are valued at exit prices quoted in the public markets 

derivative contracts held by our pension trusts are not publicly traded and each derivative contract is specifically negotiated with a unique financial counterparty and references either illiquid fund units or a unique number of synthetic units of a publicly reported market index the derivative contracts are valued based upon valuation statements received from the financial counterparties we review embedded calculations in the valuation statements and compare referenced values to external sources 

fund units are valued based upon the net asset values of the funds which we believe represent the perunit prices at which new investors are permitted to invest and the prices at which existing investors are permitted to exit to the degree net asset values as of the end of the year have not been received we use the most recently reported net asset values and adjust for market events and cash flows that have occurred between the interim date and the end of the year to estimate the fair values as of the end of the year 

assets that do not have readily available quoted prices in an active market require a higher degree of judgment to value and have a higher degree of risk that the value that could have been realized upon sale as of the valuation date could be different from the reported value than assets with observable pricing inputs it is possible that the full extent of market price liquidity currency interest rate or credit risks may not be fully factored into the fair values of our pension plan assets that use significant unobservable inputs approximately 42 billion  or 89 percent  of our pension plan assets were classified as level 3 assets as of december 31 2011 

we estimate the fair value of pension plan assets based upon the information available during the yearend reporting process in some cases primarily private equity funds the information available consists of net asset values as of an interim date cash flows between the interim date and the end of the year and market events when the difference are significant we revise the yearend estimated fair value of pension plan assets to incorporate yearend net asset values received after we have filed our annual report on form 10k we increased the fair value of pension assets in the second quarter of 2011 by 138 million  or 29 percent  

  weyerhaeuser company  2011 annual report and form 10k   68 

the net pension plan assets when categorized in accordance with this fair value hierarchy are as follows

amortization of the net actuarial loss and prior service cost credit of our pension and postretirement benefit plans will affect our other comprehensive income in 2012 the net effect of the estimated amortization will be an   increase in net periodic benefit costs or a decrease in net periodic benefit credits in 2012 



expected pension funding 

established funding standards govern the funding requirements for our qualified and registered pension plans we fund the benefit payments of our nonqualified and nonregistered plans as benefit payments come due 

based on estimated yearend asset values and projections of plan liabilities we expect to contribute the following to pension plans during 2012

expected postretirement benefit funding 

our retiree medical and life insurance plans are unfunded benefits for these plans are paid from our general assets as they come due except for benefits provided to certain unionized employees we retain the right to terminate other postretirement benefits we expect to contribute approximately 42 million  to our us and canadian other postretirement benefit plans in 2012 including approximately 10 million  expected to be required to cover benefit payments under collectively bargained contractual obligations

expected return on plan assets 

we estimate the expected longterm return on assets for our 

 qualified and registered pension plans  we reduced our expected longterm rate of return assumption for plan assets to 90 percent  at the end of 2011 the revised rate will affect the amount of net periodic benefit costs that we record in 2012 the rate is comprised of   

 determining our expected return 

 over the 27 years it has been in place our us pension trust investment strategy has achieved a 148 percent  net compound annual return rate 

based on valuations received as of yearend our total actual return on assets held by our pension trusts for the registered and qualified plans was a gain of approximately 49 million  in 2011  

these trusts fund our qualified registered and a portion of our nonregistered pension plans 

actual returns losses on assets held by our pension trusts 



  weyerhaeuser company  2011 annual report and form 10k   72 

nonregistered plans canadian tax rules require that 50 percent of the assets for nonregistered plans go to a noninterestbearing refundable tax account as a result the return we earn investing the other 50 percent is spread over 100 percent of the assets 

our expected longterm annual rate of return on the equity portion of this portfolio — the portion we are allowed to invest and manage — is 7 percent  we base that expected rate of return on 

 we reduced the expected overall annual return on assets that fund our nonregistered plan to 35 percent  at the end of 2011 the revised rate will affect the amount of net periodic benefit costs that we record in 2012 

health care costs   

rising costs of health care affect the costs of our other postretirement plans 

health care cost trend rates 

we use assumptions about health care cost trend rates to estimate the cost of benefits we provide in 2011  the assumed weighted health care cost trend rate for the next year was

unionadministered multiemployer benefit plans 

we contribute to multiemployer defined benefit plans under the terms of collectivebargaining agreements that cover some of our unionrepresented employees 

the us plans are established to provide retirement income for eligible employees who meet certain age and service requirements at retirement the benefits are generally based on 

 the canadian plan is a negotiated cost defined benefit plan the plan is established to provide retirement income for members based on their number of years of service in the industry and the benefit rate that applied to that service 

the risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from singleemployer plans in the following aspects 

 as of december 31 2011 these plans covered approximately 1330  of our employees 

our contributions were approximately 

 there have been no significant changes that affect the comparability of the 2011 2010 and 2009 contributions none of our contributions exceeded more than five percent of any plans total contributions during 2011 2010 and 2009

 the longterm debt of our monetization spes was 767 million  as of december 31 2011  and 764 million  as of december 31 2010  the weighted average interest rate was 415 percent  during 2011  and 2010  maturities of the debt at the end of 2011  were 

 bank financial instruments consist of bank guarantees backed by bank notes for three of the spe transactions and letters of credit backed by cash deposits for two of the spe transactions interest earned from each bank financial instrument is used to pay interest accrued on the corresponding spe’s debt any shortfall between interest earned and interest accrued reduces our equity in the monetization spes 

upon dissolution of the spes and payment of all obligations of the entities we would receive any net equity remaining in the monetization spes and would be required to report deferred tax gains on our income tax return in the event that proceeds from the bank financial instruments are insufficient to settle all of the liabilities of the spes we are not obligated to contribute any funds to any of the spes as of december 31 2011  our net equity in the five  spes was approximately 140 million  and the deferred tax liability was estimated to be approximately 277 million  

real estate variable interest entities 

in the ordinary course of business our real estate segment enters into lot option purchase agreements in order to procure land and residential lots for development and the construction of homes in the future the use of such lot option agreements generally allows us to reduce the risks associated with direct land ownership and development and reduces our capital and financial commitments pursuant to these lot option purchase agreements we generally provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase lots at different times in the future usually at predetermined prices 

if the entity holding the lots under option is a vie our deposit represents a variable interest in that entity if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie we consolidate the vie in our financial statements and reflect its assets and liabilities as “consolidated assets not owned” and “consolidated liabilities not owned” creditors of the entities with which we have option agreements have no recourse against us the maximum exposure to loss under our lot option agreements is limited to nonrefundable option deposits and any capitalized preacquisition costs 

in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a vie we consider our ability to control activities of the vie including but not limited to the ability to 

 if we conclude that we control such activities of the vie we also consider whether we have an obligation to absorb losses of or a right to receive benefits from the vie 

as of the end of 2011  and 2010  our nonrefundable option deposits to vies and capitalized preacquisition costs on assets under option from vies were not significant

note 14   fair value of financial instruments   

this note provides information about the fair value of our 

 fair value of debt 

the estimated fair values and carrying values of our longterm debt consisted of the following 



to estimate the fair value of longterm debt we used the following valuation approaches 

 the inputs to these valuations are based on market data obtained from independent sources or information derived principally from observable market data 

the difference between the fair value and the carrying value represents the theoretical net premium or discount we would pay or receive to retire all debt at the measurement date 

fair value of other financial instruments 

we believe that our other financial instruments including cash shortterm investments receivables and payables have net carrying values that approximate their fair values with only insignificant differences this is primarily due to

 our established reserves  we have established reserves for estimated remediation costs on the active superfund sites and other sites for which we are responsible 

changes in the reserve for environmental remediation 



reserve charges in 2011 include 11 million  related to discontinued operations 

we change our accrual to reflect 

 estimates   we believe it is reasonably possible — based on currently available information and analysis — that remediation costs for all identified sites may exceed our reserves by up to 90 million  

that estimate — in which those additional costs may be incurred over several years — is the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs the estimate 

 in estimating our current accruals and the possible range of additional future costs we 

 we have not recorded any amounts for potential recoveries from insurance carriers 

asset retirement obligations

special dividend 

to implement our decision to be taxed as a reit we distributed to our shareholders our accumulated earnings and profits determined under federal income tax provisions as a “special dividend” on september 1 2010  we paid a dividend of 56 billion  which included the special dividend and the regular quarterly dividend of approximately 11 million  at the election of each shareholder the special dividend was paid in cash or weyerhaeuser common shares the aggregate amount of cash distributed was 560 million  and the number of common shares issued was approximately 324 million  due to differences between book and tax earnings the amount of the special dividend exceeded our book retained earnings for book accounting purposes the reduction in our retained earnings was limited to the outstanding balance of our retained earnings at the time of distribution more information about the reit conversion can be found in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies

sharebased compensation expense was 

 this note provides details about 

 our longterm incentive compensation plan 

our longterm incentive compensation plan the plan provides for sharebased awards that include 

 we may issue future grants of up to 11714621 shares under the plan we also have the right to reissue forfeited and expired grants 

for stock options and stock appreciation rights 

 for restricted stock restricted stock units performance shares performance share units or other equity grants 

 the compensation committee of our board of directors the committee annually establishes an overall pool of stock awards available for grants based on performance 

for stocksettled awards we 

 our common shares would increase by approximately 45 million  shares if all sharebased awards were exercised or vested these include 

   weyerhaeuser company  2011 annual report and form 10k   80 

how we account for sharebased awards 

we 

 we recognize the cost of sharebased awards in our consolidated statement of operations  over the required service period — generally the period from the date of the grant to the date when it is vested special situations include 

 in these special situations compensation expense from sharebased awards is recognized over a period that is shorter than the stated vesting period 

tax benefits of sharebased awards 

our total income tax benefit from sharebased awards — as recognized in our consolidated statement of operations  — for the last three years was 

 tax benefits for sharebased awards are accrued as stock compensation expense is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations  tax benefits on sharebased awards are realized when 

 when actual tax benefits realized exceed the tax benefits accrued for sharebased awards we realize an excess tax benefit we report the excess tax benefit as financing cash inflows rather than operating cash inflows we had excess tax benefits of 2 million  in 2011 and none  in 2010  or 2009  

types of sharebased compensation 

our sharebased compensation is in the form of 

 stock options 

stock options entitle award recipients to purchase shares of our common stock at a fixed exercise price we grant stock options with an exercise price equal to the market price of our stock on the date of the grant 

the details 

our stock options generally 

 the vesting and posttermination vesting terms for stock options granted in 2011 and 2010 were as follows 

 the vesting and posttermination vesting terms for stock options granted in 2009 were as follows 

 during first quarter 2009 we awarded selected executives with special stock options that 

   weyerhaeuser company  2011 annual report and form 10k   81 

our accounting 

we use a blackscholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of every stock option award on its grant date 

in our estimates we use 

 the expected volatility in our valuation model is based on 

 weighted average assumptions used in estimating value of stock options granted 



sharebased compensation expense for stock options is generally recognized over the vesting period there are exceptions for stock options awarded to employees who 

 

in these cases we record the sharebased compensation expense over a required service period that is less than the stated vesting period 

activity 

the following table shows our option unit activity for 2011  



restricted stock units 

through the plan we award restricted stock units — grants that entitle the holder to shares of our stock as the award vests 

the details 

our restricted stock units granted in 2011  and 2010  generally 

 our restricted stock units granted in 2009  generally 

   weyerhaeuser company  2011 annual report and form 10k   82 

our accounting 

the fair value of our restricted stock units is the market price of our stock on the grant date of the awards 

we generally record sharebased compensation expense for restricted stock units over the fouryear vesting period generally for restricted stock units that continue to vest following the termination of employment we record the sharebased compensation expense over a required service period that is less than the stated vesting period for restricted stock units granted in 2009 we reverse the expense related to the unvested portion of the award following termination of employment 

activity 

the following table shows our restricted stock unit activity for 2011  



nonvested restricted stock units accrue dividends that are paid out when restricted stock units vest any restricted stock units forfeited will not receive dividends 

as restricted stock units vest a portion of the shares awarded is withheld to cover employee taxes as a result the number of stock units vested and the number of common shares issued will differ 

performance share units 

in 2011  as part of a new longterm incentive compensation strategy intended to tie executive compensation more closely to company performance we granted a target number of performance share units to executives performance share units will be paid in the form of shares of weyerhaeuser stock – to the extent earned through company performance against financial goals – over a fouryear vesting period 

the details 

the final number of shares awarded will range from 0 percent  to 150 percent  of each grant’s target depending upon actual company performance 

the ultimate number of performance share units earned is based on two measures 

 at the end of the twoyear performance period and over a further twoyear vesting period performance share units would be paid in shares of our stock performance share units granted in 2011 and that are earned vest as follows 

 our accounting 

since the award contains a market condition the effect of the market condition is reflected in the grant date fair value which is estimated using a monte carlo simulation model this model estimates the tsr ranking of the company among the sp 500 index over the twoyear performance period compensation expense is based on the estimated probable number of earned awards and recognized over the fouryear vesting period on an accelerated basis generally compensation expense would be reversed if the performance condition is not met unless the requisite service period has been achieved 

weighted average assumptions used in estimating the value of performance share units 



  weyerhaeuser company  2011 annual report and form 10k   83 

activity 

the following table shows our performance share unit activity at target levels for 2011 



the companys performance against the cash flow metrics during 2011 determined the initial number of performance shares earned to be slightly above target the ultimate number of performance shares earned may be adjusted as the tsr component will be used to modify the initial number of shares earned up or down by 20 percent  no performance share units were awarded in 2009 or 2010 

as performance share units vest a portion of the shares awarded is withheld to cover participant taxes as a result the number of stock units vested and the number of common shares issued will differ 

stock appreciation rights 

through the plan we grant cashsettled stock appreciation rights as part of certain compensation awards 

the details 

stock appreciation rights are similar to stock options employees benefit when the market price of our stock is higher on the exercise date than it was on the date the stock appreciation rights were granted the differences are that the employee 

 the vesting conditions and exceptions are the same as for 10year stock options details are in the stock options section earlier in this note 

stock appreciation rights are generally issued to employees outside of the us 

our accounting 

we use a blackscholes optionvaluation model to estimate the fair value of a stock appreciation right on its grant   date and every subsequent reporting date that the right is outstanding stock appreciation rights are liabilityclassified awards and the fair value is remeasured at every reporting date 

the process used to develop our valuation assumptions is the same as for the 10year stock options we grant details are in the stock options section earlier in this note

unrecognized sharebased compensation 

as of december 31 2011  our unrecognized sharebased compensation cost for all types of sharebased awards included 

 deferred compensation stock equivalent units 

certain employees and our board of directors can defer compensation into stockequivalent units 

the details 

the plan works differently for employees and directors 

eligible employees 

 our directors 

 employees and directors also choose when the deferrals will be paid out although no deferrals may be paid until after the separation from service of the employee or director 

our accounting 

we settle all deferred compensation accounts in cash in addition we credit all stockequivalent accounts with dividend equivalents 

stockequivalent units are 

 the fair value of a stockequivalent unit is equal to the market price of our stock 

subsequent to yearend the directors plan was amended to allow directors the ability to elect to receive payments of stockequivalent units in cash or common shares the number of common shares to be issued for directors who elected common share payments is 509362  

activity 

the number of stockequivalent units outstanding in our deferred compensation accounts was 

 during 2010 the number of stockequivalent units outstanding in our deferred compensation accounts increased by 664957  as a result of the special dividend

note 18   charges for restructuring closures and asset impairments   

items included in our restructuring closure and asset impairment charges 



restructuring and closures 

our restructuring and closure charges were primarily related to various wood products operations we closed or curtailed and restructuring our corporate staff functions to support achieving our competitive performance goals 

pension and postretirement charges include a 76 million  noncash pension charge during 2009 triggered by the amount of lumpsum distributions paid in 2009 to former employees — see note 8 pension and other postretirement benefit plans  for more information 

other restructuring and closure costs include lease termination charges dismantling and demolition of plant and equipment gain or loss on disposition of assets environmental cleanup costs and incremental costs to wind down operating facilities 

accrued termination benefits 

changes in accrued severance related to restructuring and facility closures during 2011  were as follows 



asset impairments 

the impairment of longlived assets  and goodwill  sections of note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  provide details about how we account for these impairments 

  weyerhaeuser company  2011 annual report and form 10k   86 

longlived assets 

our longlived asset impairments were primarily related to the following 

 real estate impairments and charges 

we review homebuilding longlived assets and investments within our real estate segment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable these assets are stated at cost unless events or circumstances trigger an impairment review if a triggering event occurs and the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable we record an impairment loss which is the difference between the asset’s book value and fair value the determination of fair value is based on appraisals and market pricing of comparable assets when that information is available or the discounted value of estimated future net cash flows from these assets 

in recent years unfavorable market conditions caused us to reevaluate our strategy to develop certain projects reduce sales prices and increase customer incentives because of such changes we reassessed the recoverability of several of our investments which triggered impairment charges asset impairments are recorded as adjustments to the cost basis of inventory and investments 

the number of real estate projects owned or operated by us ranged from approximately 100  to 125  during the 3year period presented this includes communities where we were actively building homes or developing land and land positions held for future development the table below provides for each period indicated 

 real estate impairments relate primarily to projects or communities held for development within a community that is held for development there may be individual homes or parcels of land that are currently held for sale impairment charges recognized as a result of adjusting individual heldforsale assets within a community to estimated fair value less cost to sell are also included in the total impairment charges below impairment charges also include impairments of certain assets that were disposed of during the year impaired book values at december 31 only include assets that were impaired during the year and that remain on our balance sheet as of the end of each year 



the significant unobservable inputs used in amounts reported above are discounted future cash flows of the projects we use present value techniques based on discounting the estimated cash flows using a rate commensurate with the inherent risk associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams discount rates applied to the estimated future cash flows of our homebuilding assets for 2011 and 2010 ranged from 15 percent  to 18 percent  discount rates applied to the estimated future cash flows of our homebuilding assets for 2009 ranged from 12 percent  to 25 percent  

writeoff of preacquisition costs and abandoned community costs 

in addition to owning land and residential lots we also have option agreements to purchase land and lots at a future date as of december 31 2011  we have option agreements on approximately 63000  residential lots nonrefundable option deposits and capitalized preacquisition costs associated with these lots were 37 million  as of december 31 2011  when the economics of a project no longer support acquisition of the land or lots under option we may elect not to move forward with the acquisition option deposits and capitalized engineering and related costs associated with the assets under option may be forfeited at that time charges for such forfeitures are reported as writeoff of preacquisition costs 

also included in 2009 are charges for abandoned community costs which include the writeoff of unamortized costs related to projects that have been closed prior to full buildout or related to model complex costs written off due to decisions to sell active communities in their current condition or to change home styles offered within a community

onetime tax benefitscharges 

in 2011 we recorded a tax benefit related to foreign tax credits associated with the repatriation of canadian earnings 

as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act as modified by the health care and education reconciliation act and a change in our postretirement medical plan it was determined that previously recognized deferred tax assets related to the income tax deduction for prescription drug benefits provided to retirees and reimbursed under the medicare part d subsidy would not be realized and a 32 million  charge was recorded in 2010 

in 2010 we reversed certain deferred income tax liabilities primarily relating to temporary differences of timber assets as a result of our conversion to a reit see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  

there were no  onetime deferred tax benefits or charges during 2009  

fuel credits 

during 2009 the us internal revenue code allowed a 050  per gallon tax credit for the alternative fuel component of alternative fuel mixtures produced and used as a fuel in a taxpayer’s trade or business in 2009 we had 688 million  gallons of qualifying alternative fuel mixture resulting in 344 million  of credits the alternative fuel mixture credit expired on december 31 2009 

in 2010 the irs concluded that black liquor sold or used in 2009 qualifies for the cellulosic biofuel producer credit black liquor potentially qualifies for either the cellulosic biofuel producer credit or the alternative fuel mixture credit but not both on the same gallon of black liquor during 2009 we produced approximately 238 million  gallons of black liquor which did not qualify for the alternative fuel mixture credit this equals 240 million  of potential cellulosic biofuel producer credit at 101  per gallon or 149 million  net of tax which we recognized in fourth quarter 2010

our state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards as of the end of 2011  are as follows 

 valuation allowances 

with the exception of the valuation allowance discussed below we believe it is more likely than not that we will have sufficient future taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets 

our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets was 146 million  as of the end of 2011  this primarily related to foreign and state net operating losses and state and provincial credits 

the total changes in our valuation allowance over the last year was a net increase of 4 million  this net increase resulted primarily from 

 reinvestment of undistributed earnings 

in 2011 we made the decision to dividend earnings from a foreign subsidiary which allows us to recognize a tax benefit of 76 million  related to foreign tax credits associated with the repatriation of canadian earnings the balance of our foreign undistributed earnings was approximately 22 million  at the end of 2011 and has been permanently reinvested therefore it is not subject to us income tax generally such earnings become subject to us tax upon the remittance of dividends and under certain other circumstances it is not practicable to estimate the amount

of deferred tax liability on the remaining undistributed earnings 

how we account for income taxes 

the income taxes section of note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  provides details about how we account for our income taxes 

unrecognized tax benefits 

unrecognized tax benefits represent potential future obligations to taxing authorities if uncertain tax positions we have taken on previously filed tax returns are not sustained the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2011  and 2010  are 251 million  and 180 million  respectively which does not include related interest of 33 million  and 30 million  respectively these amounts represent the gross amount of exposure in individual jurisdictions and do not reflect any additional benefits expected to be realized if such positions were not sustained such as the federal deduction that could be realized if an unrecognized state deduction was not sustained 

reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits 



the net liability recorded in our consolidated balance sheet  related to unrecognized tax benefits was 24 million  as of december 31 2011  and 48 million  as of december 31 2010  which includes interest of 33 million  and 27 million  respectively net of payments made in advance of settlements 

the net liability recorded for tax positions across all jurisdictions that if sustained would affect our effective tax rate was 140 million  as of december 31 2011  and 98 million  as of december 31 2010  which includes interest of 33 million  and 27 million  respectively 

in accordance with our accounting policy we accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 

as of december 31 2011  our 2008  2010 federal income tax audit has not yet begun we are undergoing examination in various state and foreign jurisdictions for the 2005  2010  tax years we expect that the outcome of any examination will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements however audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty 

in the next 12 months we estimate a decrease of up to 4 million  in unrecognized tax benefits on several individually insignificant tax positions due to the lapse of applicable statutes of limitation in multiple jurisdictions

key quarterly financial data for the last two years 



to implement our decision to be taxed as a reit we distributed our accumulated earnings and profits to our shareholders determined under federal income tax provisions as a “special dividend” on september 1 2010  we paid a dividend of 56 billion  which included the special dividend and the regular quarterly dividend of approximately 11 million  at the election of each shareholder the special dividend was paid in cash or weyerhaeuser common shares the number of common shares issued was approximately 324 million  the stock portion of the special dividend was treated as the issuance of new shares for accounting purposes and affects our earnings per share only for periods after the distribution prior periods are not restated the required treatment results in earnings per share that is less than would have been the case had the common shares not been issued see note 4 net earnings loss per share  for pro forma results giving effect to the common stock distribution for diluted earnings per common share as if the common stock distribution had occurred at the beginning of each period in addition our stock price decreased on the exdividend date to reflect the issuance of common stock 

during third quarter 2010 we also reversed certain deferred income tax liabilities as a result of our reit conversion which resulted in a 1064 million  benefit in the consolidated statement of operations

our mda includes the following major sections 

 



in 2011 the us economy slowed its pace of recovery the underlying causes included the japan earthquake and tsunami the us deficit and related political instability and european debt crisis these factors weighed heavily on the economy delaying many anticipated improvements in key economic indicators the us housing market continues to be affected by these events and consequently lags other sectors in the recovery improvement in the latter part of 2011 in key areas such as job creation industrial production and gdp may help spur growth in us housing however the sector remains burdened by excess inventory and a diminished pool of qualified home buyers the health of the us housing market strongly affects our real estate wood products and timberlands segments real estate focuses on building single family homes wood products primarily sells into the new residential building and repair and remodel markets demand for logs from our timberlands segment is affected by the production of woodbased building products as well as export demand cellulose fibers is primarily affected by global demand and the relative strength of the us dollar 

housing market 

we track certain indicators such as employment consumer confidence housing starts home sales foreclosures home prices mortgage interest rates and the number of homes for sale to assess housing market conditions the following market statements refer to industry conditions in general and not to weyerhaeuser operations directly 

total us housing starts for 2011 were 606 thousand units with single family units accounting for 429 thousand of the total this represents a 9 percent decline in single family starts from 2010 however demand for homes was bolstered by government programs such as the new home buyer tax credit for part of the year in 2010 these programs were not renewed in 2011 multifamily construction did relatively better in 2011 compared with 2010 averaging 177 thousand units compared with 114 thousand in 2010 in total current housing demand remains well below 1 million or more single family starts the typical level during the 15year period of 19922007 new home sales in the us totaled 303 thousand units in 2011 this level of new home sales is 6 percent lower than 2010 and lower than any year recorded since 1963 when us census started reporting this data through much of 2011 the unemployment rate has remained above 9 percent but as of december had fallen to 85 percent the lowest level for the year weak employment growth contributed to weak consumer confidence limiting any growth in demand for housing and wood products the number of mortgages in default remains very large and the number of foreclosures is expected to remain high relative to historic trends this will continue to contribute to the inventory of existing homes for sale which limits demand for new homes 

demand for wood products continued to be affected by the depressed level of new home construction in 2011 overall demand levels for lumber increased 3 percent from 2010 while demand for oriented strand board osb which is more heavily dependent on residential construction increased 15 percent from 2010 levels demand for both lumber and osb remain 35 percent to 40 percent below peak levels as a result industry operating rates for lumber and osb have averaged between 70 and 80 percent of capacity prices for some commodity wood products were modestly higher in 2011 while others such as southern yellow pine lumber and osb were lower in 2011 than in 2010 in 2011 most prices peaked in the second quarter coinciding with the strongest quarter of construction but decreased to levels closer to their costs of production for much of the year demand for logs increased as lumber production increased slightly in the western region weak domestic demand for logs was offset by demand from japan china and korea resulting in significant increases in western log prices in 2011 

us dollarglobal demand 

the us dollar remained weak relative to most developed world currencies during 2011 cellulose fibers benefited from the decline in the value of the us dollar as our pulp mills became more competitive compared to european canadian and south american producers the combination of the weaker dollar steady global demand and flat capacity helped prices for the key indicator northern bleached softwood kraft nbsk pulp to remain above 950ton in 2011 2 percent higher than in 2010 pulp prices started the year similar to 2010 peaking in the second quarter and then declining into the fourth quarter largely as a result of a weakening euro debt concerns in the eurozone countries has lowered the value of the euro relative to the us dollar reducing the competiveness of us producers relative to european competitors causing a decline in the key nbsk indicator price in the fourth quarter 

the weaker dollar compared to the yen resulted in us logs being less expensive to importers in japan although japan experienced a major disruption with the earthquake and tsunami in march 2011 total housing starts in japan increased 3 percent from 2010 levels as rebuilding efforts began in the second half of the year the export log market was affected by increased demand from china chinese imports of softwood logs from the us were estimated to exceed 5 million cubic meters for 2011 double the level from 2010

where we are headed 

growth in the us economy improved to 28 percent in fourth quarter 2011 compared to 18 percent in third quarter 2011 and that momentum is expected to continue into 2012 job growth also has shown gradual improvement in the latter part of 2011 and the us is expected to add enough jobs to lower the overall unemployment rate in 2012 singlefamily starts are expected to gradually increase in 2012 a result of improving demand for homes and record low inventory of new homes for sale demand for wood products is expected to increase as a result of greater demand for housing however sustainable demand growth is expected to be modest in 2012 as a result prices in 2012 are expected to be similar to 2011 log prices in western markets are expected to remain flat exclusive of seasonal swings in the south log prices are also expected to remain flat but at lower levels than the west which benefits from strong demand from asia the us dollar is expected to remain weak relative to developed currencies outside of the euro which is expected to continue to be affected by uncertainty in the eurozone weakness in the euro is expected to undermine the competitive position of us market pulp producers and will likely put downward pressure on prices 



starting with our 2010 fiscal year we elected to be taxed as a reit we expect to derive most of our reit income from investments in timberlands including the sale of standing timber through payascut sales contracts reit income can be distributed to shareholders without first paying corporate level tax substantially eliminating the double taxation on income a significant portion of our timberland segment earnings receives this favorable tax treatment we are however subject to corporate taxes on builtingains the excess of fair market value over tax basis at january 1 2010 on sales of real property other than standing timber held by the reit during the first 10 years following the reit conversion we continue to be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on earnings of our taxable reit subsidiary trs which principally includes our manufacturing businesses our real estate development business and our nonqualified timberland segment income following are points related to our conversion

we started out as weyerhaeuser timber company incorporated in the state of washington in january 1900 when frederick weyerhaeuser and 15 partners bought 900000 acres of timberland 

real estate investment trust reit conversion 

our board of directors has determined that conversion to a reit best supports our strategic direction for tax purposes this change was effective january 1 2010 to implement our decision to be taxed as a reit we distributed to our shareholders our accumulated earnings and profits determined under federal income tax provisions as a “special dividend” on september 1 2010 

as a reit we expect to derive most of our reit income from investments in timberlands including the sale of standing timber through payascut sales contracts reit income can be distributed to shareholders without first paying corporate level tax substantially eliminating the double taxation on income a significant portion of our timberland segment earnings will receive this favorable tax treatment we will however be subject to corporate taxes on builtingains the excess of fair market value over tax basis at january 1 2010 on sales of real property other than standing timber held by the reit during the first 10 years following the reit conversion we also will continue to be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on earnings of our taxable reit subsidiary trs which principally includes our manufacturing businesses our real estate development business and our nonqualified timberland segment income

current market conditions 

the us economy has gradually begun its recovery from the most severe recession since the 1930’s however the us housing market continues to lag other sectors in the recovery and remains burdened by excess inventory and a diminished pool of qualified home buyers the health of the us housing market strongly affects our real estate wood products and timberlands segments real estate focuses on building single family homes wood products primarily sells into the new residential building and repair and remodel markets demand for logs from our timberlands segment is affected by the production of woodbased building products cellulose fibers is primarily affected by global demand and the value of the us dollar 

competition in our markets 

we operate in highly competitive domestic and foreign markets with numerous companies selling similar products many of our products also face competition from substitutes for wood and woodfiber products in real estate development our competitors include numerous regional and national firms we compete in our markets primarily through price product quality and service levels 

our business segments’ competitive strategies are as follows 

 

    sales outside the us 

in 2010 21 billion — 32 percent — of our total consolidated sales and revenues were to customers outside the us the table below shows sales outside the us for the last three years

what we do 

 

this section provides information about how we 

 

    for each of our business segments we provide details about what we do where we do it how much we sell and where we are headed 

timberlands 

our timberlands business segment manages 65 million acres of private commercial forestland worldwide we own 58 million of those acres and lease the other 07 million acres in addition we have renewable longterm licenses on 140 million acres of forestland located in four canadian provinces the tables presented in this section include data from this segment’s business units as of the end of 2010 

what we do 

forestry management 

our timberlands business segment 

 

     our goal is to maximize returns by selling logs and stumpage to internal and external customers we focus on solid wood and use intensive silviculture to improve forest productivity and returns while managing our forests on a sustainable basis to meet customer and public expectations 

international operations in this segment consist principally of forest plantations forest licenses and converting assets in south america we serve as owners or managing partner in these operations which are either whollyowned subsidiaries or joint ventures in china we are the managing partner in a joint venture established in 2007 we own 51 percent of this joint venture and fujian yong’an forestry company owns the remaining 49 percent as of december 31 2010 the joint venture managed 44000 acres of timberlands 

sustainable forestry practices 

we are committed to responsible environmental stewardship wherever we operate managing forests to produce financially mature timber while protecting the ecosystem services they provide our working forests include places with unique environmental cultural historical or recreational value to protect their unique qualities we follow regulatory requirements voluntary standards and implement the sustainable forestry initiative ® sfi standard independent auditing of all of the forests we own or manage in the united states and canada certifies that we meet the sfi standard our forestlands in uruguay are forest stewardship council fsc certified or managed to the developing uruguayan national forestry management standard designed to meet the program for the endorsement of forest certification pefc 

canadian forestry operations 

in canada we have licenses to operate forestlands that provide raw material for our manufacturing units in various provinces when we harvest trees we pay the provinces at stumpage rates set by the government and generally based on prevailing market prices we do not generate any profit in the timberlands segment from the harvest of timber from the licensed acres in canada 

other values from our timberlands 

in the united states we actively manage mineral oil and gas leases on our land and use geologic databases to identify and market opportunities for commercial mineral and geothermal development we recognize leasing revenue over the terms of agreements with customers revenue primarily comes from 

 

     in managing mineral resources we generate revenue related to our ownership of the minerals and separately related to our ownership of the surface the ownership of mineral rights and surface acres may be held by two separate parties materials that can be mined from the surface and whose value comes from factors other than their chemical composition typically belong to the surface owner examples of surface materials include rock sand gravel dirt and topsoil the mineral owner holds the title to commodities that derive value from their 

  

 

 unique chemical composition examples of mineral rights include oil gas coal even if mined at the surface and precious metals if the two types of rights conflict then mineral rights are generally superior to surface rights a third type of land right is geothermal which can belong to either the surface or mineral owner we routinely reserve mineral and geothermal rights when selling surface timberlands acreage 

timberlands products 

 

 how we measure our product 

we report timberlands data in cubic meters cubic meters measure the total volume of wood fiber in a tree or log that we can sell cubic meter volume is determined from the large and smallend diameters and length and provides a more consistent and comparative measure of timber and log volume among operating regions species size and seasons of the year than other units of measure 

we also use two other units of measure when transacting business including 

 

  both measures are accurate in the regions where they are used but they do not provide a meaningful basis for comparisons between the regions 

the conversion rate for mbf to cubic meters varies based on several factors including diameter length and taper of the timber the average conversion rate for mbf to cubic meters is approximately 67 cubic meters per mbf 

the conversion rate from green tons to cubic meters also varies based on the season harvested and the specific gravity of the wood for the region where the timber is grown an average conversion rate for green tons to cubic meters is approximately 0825 cubic meters per green ton 

where we do it 

our timberlands assets are located primarily in north america in the us we own and manage sustainable forests in nine states for use in wood products and pulp and paper manufacturing we own or lease 

 

  our international operations are located primarily in uruguay and china where as of december 31 2010 we own a total of 317000 acres and have longterm leases on another 70000 acres 

in addition we have renewable longterm licenses on 140 million acres of forestland owned by the provincial government of four canadian provinces 

our total timber inventory — including timber on owned and leased land in our us and international operations — is approximately 303 million cubic meters the timber inventory on licensed lands in canada is approximately 371 million cubic meters the amount of timber inventory does not translate into an amount of lumber or panel products because the quantity of end products 

 

  the species size and grade of the trees affects the relative value of our timberlands 

discussion of operations by geography 

summary of 2010 timber inventory and timberland locations 

united states 

 

   

 

 western united states 

our western acres are well situated to serve the wood product markets in oregon and washington their location near weyerhaeuser mills and many thirdparty facilities allows for multiple sales opportunities in addition our location on the west coast provides access to highervalue export markets for douglas fir and hemlock logs in japan korea and china the size and quality of our western timberlands coupled with their proximity to several deepwater port facilities positions us to meet the needs of pacific rim log markets 

our lands are composed primarily of douglas fir a species highly valued for its structural strength our coastal lands also contain western hemlock and have a higher proportion of hemlock than our interior holdings our management systems which provide us a competitive operating advantage range from research and forestry to technical planning models mechanized harvesting and marketing and logistics 

the average age of timber harvested in 2010 was 50 years most of our us timberland is intensively managed for timber production but some areas are conserved for environmental historical recreational or cultural reasons some of our older trees are protected in acreage set aside for conservation and some are not yet logged due to harvest rate regulations while over the long term our average harvest age will decrease in accordance with our sustainable forestry practices we will only harvest approximately 15 percent of our western acreage each year 

southern united states 

our southern acres predominantly contain southern yellow pine and encompass timberlands in seven states this area provides a constant year round flow of logs to a variety of internal and thirdparty customers we sell grade logs to mills that manufacture a diverse range of products including lumber plywood and veneer we also sell chips and fiber logs to oriented strand board pulp and paper mills our timberlands are well located to take advantage of road logging and transportation systems for efficient delivery of logs to these customers 

we intensively manage our timber plantations using forestry research and planning systems to optimize grade log production we also actively manage our land to capture revenues from our oil gas and hard minerals resources we do this while providing quality habitat for a range of animals and birds which is in high demand for recreational purposes we lease more than 95 percent of our acres to the public and state wildlife agencies for recreational purposes 

the average age of timber harvested in 2010 was 31 years for southern yellow pine in accordance with our sustainable forestry practices we harvest approximately 30 percent to 35 percent of our acreage each year in the south 

international 

 

 our forestlands in uruguay are approximately 51 percent loblolly pine and 49 percent eucalyptus on average the timber in uruguay is in the first third of its rotation age it is entering into that part of the growth rotation when we will see increased volume accretion about 93 percent of the area to be planted has been afforested to date the afforestation program is planned to be completed within the next two years 

in uruguay the target rotation ages are 21 to 22 years for pine and 14 to 17 years for eucalyptus we manage both species to a grade appearance regime 

we also operate a plywood mill in uruguay with a production capacity of 140000 cubic meters and a production volume of 109000 cubic meters reached in 2010 construction to more than double this capacity is under way and is expected to be completed in april 2011 

in brazil weyerhaeuser is a managing partner in a joint venture we own 67 percent and fibria cellulose sa owns 33 percent a hardwood sawmill with 65000 cubic meters of capacity produces highvalue eucalyptus lyptus ®  lumber and related appearance wood products the mill’s production in 2010 was 55000 cubic meters 

our investment in china is a joint venture with a public company that is controlled by the state and local governments weyerhaeuser is the managing partner in a joint venture started in 2007 ownership is 51 percent weyerhaeuser and 49 percent fujian yong’an forestry company the joint venture currently manages 44000 acres of timberlands 

in china the target rotation age is seven years since we are managing the forests of loblolly pine and eucalyptus for fiber 

  

 

 canada — licensed timberlands 

 

 we lease and license forestland in canada from the provincial government to secure the volume for our manufacturing units in the various provinces when the volume is harvested we pay the province at stumpage rates set by the government and generally based on prevailing market prices the harvested logs are transferred to our manufacturing facilities at cost stumpage plus harvest haul and overhead costs less any margin on selling logs to third parties any conversion profit is recognized at the respective mill in either the cellulose fibers or wood products segment 

fiveyear summary of timberlands production 

 

 our timberlands annual fee depletion represents the harvest of the timber assets we own depletion is a method of expensing the cost of establishing the fee timber asset base over the harvest or timber sales volume the decline in fee depletion from 2008 through 2010 reflects the company’s decision to defer harvest and preserve the longterm value of the assets

log sales volumes 

logs sold to unaffiliated customers in 2010 decreased approximately 106 thousand cubic meters — 1 percent — from 2009 

 

    we sell three grades of logs — domestic grade domestic fiber and export factors that may affect log sales in each of these categories include 

 

   our sales volumes include logs purchased in the open market and all our domestic and export logs are sold to unaffiliated customers or transferred at market prices to our internal mills by the sales and marketing staff within our timberlands business units

 log prices 

the majority of our log sales to unaffiliated customers involves sales to the export market and to other domestic sawmills in the pacific northwest following is a fiveyear summary of selected export log prices 

fiveyear summary of selected export log prices 

2 sawlog bark on — mbf 

our log prices are affected by the supply of and demand for grade and fiber logs and are influenced by the same factors that affect log sales export log prices are particularly affected by the japanese housing market 

average 2010 log realizations in the west and south increased from 2009 — primarily due to higher domestic log prices caused by the relative recovery in lumber prices during the year 

  

 

 as compared to 2009 western export realizations also increased due to the demand of logs in the china market export prices driven by the china demand also influenced the higher western domestic prices 

minerals and energy products 

mineral revenue decreased in 2010 as recognition of leasing revenue was completed on some older leases and sales of producing oil and gas properties was limited the decline was partially offset by increased oil and gas royalties as production from haynesville shale gas wells came on line overall royalties from construction aggregates increased slightly revenues from wind power and geothermal agreements remained the same from yeartoyear but the company entered into five new wind power agreements

catchlight energy is weyerhaeuser’s joint venture with chevron which is focused on the commercialization of liquid transportation fuels produced from conversion of forestbased material during 2010 catchlight was engaged in research and development work in the areas of sustainability feedstock sourcing and scalability and conversion technologies catchlight energy also spent time developing relationships with selected technology partners results of catchlight energy are reported in the corporate and other segment 

  

 

  

natural resource and environmental matters 

 

many social values are expressed in the laws and regulations that pertain to growing and harvesting timber we participate in voluntary certification of our timberlands to assure that we sustain their values including the protection of wildlife and water quality we are also subject to laws regulating forestry practices changes in law and regulation can significantly affect local or regional timber harvest levels and market values of timberbased raw materials 

endangered species protections 

in the united states a number of fish and wildlife species that inhabit geographic areas near or within our timberlands have been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal endangered species act esa or similar state laws including 

 

   additional species or populations may be listed as threatened or endangered as a result of pending or future citizen petitions or petitions initiated by federal or state agencies 

restrictions on our timber harvests result or could result from 

 

   such actions also could increase our operating costs and affect timber supply and prices in general 

in canada the federal species at risk act sara requires protective measures for species identified as being at risk and for critical habitat environment canada announced a series of western science studies in 2010 that with other landscape information are designed to identify critical habitat the identification and protection of habitat may over time result in additional restrictions on timber harvests and other forest management practices that could increase operating costs for operators of forestlands in canada to date these canadian measures have not had and in 2011 will not have a significant effect on our harvesting operations we anticipate that future measures will not disproportionally affect weyerhaeuser as compared with comparable operations 

regulations affecting forestry practices 

in the united states regulations established by federal state and local governments or agencies to protect water quality and wetlands could affect future harvests and forest management practices on some of our timberlands forest practice acts in some states in the united states that increasingly affect present or future harvest and forest management activities include 

 

      each state in which we own timberlands has developed best management practices to reduce the effects of forest practices on water quality and aquatic habitats additional and more stringent regulations may be adopted by various state and local governments to achieve waterquality standards under the federal clean water act protect fish and wildlife habitats or achieve other public policy objectives 

in canada our forest operations are carried out on public forestlands under forest licenses all forest operations are subject to 

 

    on may 18 2010 21 member companies of the forest products association of canada fpac including weyerhaeuser’s canadian subsidiary announced the signing of a canadian boreal forest agreement cbfa with nine environmental organizations the cbfa applies to approximately 72 million hectares of public forests licensed to fpac members and when fully implemented is expected to lead to the conservation of significant areas of canada’s boreal forest and protection of woodland caribou cbfa signators are meeting with provincial governments and aboriginal and local communities to seek their participation in advancing the goals of the cbfa progress under the cbfa will be measured by an independent auditor 

  

 

 forest certification standards 

we operate in north america under the sustainable forestry initiative ®  this is a certification standard designed to supplement government regulatory programs with voluntary landowner initiatives to further protect certain public resources and values the sustainable forestry initiative ® is an independent standard overseen by a governing board consisting of 

 

    compliance with the sustainable forestry initiative ® may result in some increases in our operating costs and curtailment of our timber harvests in some areas 

what these regulations and certification programs mean to us 

the regulatory and nonregulatory forest management programs described above have 

 

     we believe that these kinds of programs have not had and in 2011 will not have a significant effect on the total harvest of timber in the united states or canada however these kinds of programs may have such an effect in the future we expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these programs as compared with typical owners of comparable timberlands we also expect that these programs will not significantly disrupt our planned operations over large areas or for extended periods 

canadian aboriginal rights 

many of the canadian forestlands are subject to the constitutionally protected treaty or commonlaw rights of aboriginal peoples of canada most of british columbia bc is not covered by treaties and as a result the claims of bc’s aboriginal peoples relating to forest resources are largely unresolved although many aboriginal groups are engaged in treaty discussions with the governments of bc and canada 

final or interim resolution of claims brought by aboriginal groups is expected to result in 

 

   we believe that such claims will not have a significant effect on our total harvest of timber or production of forest products in 2011 although they may have such an effect in the future in 2008 fpac of which we are a member signed a memorandum of understanding with the assembly of first nations under which the parties agree to work together to strengthen canada’s forest sector through economicdevelopment initiatives and business investments strong environmental stewardship and the creation of skilldevelopment opportunities particularly targeted to aboriginal youth 

pollutioncontrol regulations 

our operations are subject to various laws and regulations including 

 

    these laws and regulations as well as market demands impose controls with regard to 

 

    compliance with these laws regulations and demands usually involves capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs we cannot easily quantify the future amounts of capital expenditures we might have to make to comply with these laws regulations and demands or the effects on our operating costs because in some instances compliance standards have not been developed or have not become final or definitive in addition it is difficult to isolate the environmental component of most manufacturing capital projects 

our capital projects typically are designed to 

 

         

 

 we estimate that our capital expenditures made primarily for environmental compliance were approximately 3 million in 2010 approximately 1 percent of total capital expenditures based on our understanding of current regulatory requirements in the us and canada we expect that capital expenditures for environmental compliance will be approximately 4 million in 2011 approximately 2 percent of expected total capital expenditures 

environmental cleanup 

we are involved in the environmental investigation or remediation of numerous sites of these sites we may have the sole obligation to remediate or may share that obligation with one or more parties in some instances several parties have joint and several obligations to remediate some sites are superfund sites where we have been named as a potentially responsible party our liability with respect to these various sites ranges from insignificant to substantial the amount of liability depends on the quantity toxicity and nature of materials at the site and depends on the number and economic viability of the other responsible parties 

we spent approximately 6 million in 2010 and expect to spend approximately 5 million in 2011 on environmental remediation of these sites 

it is our policy to accrue for environmentalremediation costs when we 

 

  we currently believe it is reasonably possible that our costs to remediate all the identified sites may exceed our current accruals of 29 million the excess amounts required may be insignificant or could range in the aggregate up to approximately 97 million over several years this estimate of the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs is much less certain than the estimates we currently are using to determine how much to accrue the estimate of the upper range also uses assumptions less favorable to us among the range of reasonably possible outcomes 

regulation of air emissions in the us 

the united states environmental protection agency epa had promulgated regulations for air emissions from 

 

   these regulations cover 

 

  the us court of appeals for the dc circuit issued decisions in 2007 

 

  the epa must promulgate 

 

  pending final action by the epa we expect 

 

  we cannot currently quantify the amount of capital we will need in the future to comply with new regulations being developed by the epa or canadian environmental agencies because final rules have not been promulgated 

to comply with these regulations we 

 

    in 2007 the us supreme court ruled that greenhouse gases are pollutants that can be subject to regulation under the clean air act as a result the epa 

 

    

 

    it is unclear what the effect of epa’s greenhouse gas regulations will be on our operations until final rules regarding biomass emissions are promulgated 

additional factors that could affect greenhouse gas emissions in the future include 

 

   it is not yet known when and to what extent these policy activities may come into force or how they may relate to each other in the future 

we believe these measures have not had and in 2011 will not have a significant effect on our operations although they may have such an effect in the future we expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with typical owners of comparable operations we maintain an active forestry research program to track and understand any potential effect from actual climate change related parameters that could affect the forests we own and manage and do not anticipate any disruptions to our planned operations 

regulation of air emissions in canada 

we participate in negotiations between the fpac and natural resources canada to define industry obligations for complying with canada’s national plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions over the next several years fpac continues to work with international national and regional policy makers in their efforts to develop technically sound and economically viable policies practices and procedures for measuring reporting and managing greenhouse gas emissions 

the canadian federal government 

 

    canadian provincial governments 

 

     we believe these measures have not had and in 2011 will not have a significant effect on our operations although they may have such an effect in the future we expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with typical owners of comparable operations we also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations 

potential changes in pollution regulation 

state governments continue to promulgate total maximum daily load tmdl requirements for pollutants in water bodies that do not meet state or epa water quality standards state tmdl requirements may set limits on pollutants that may be discharged to a body of water or set additional requirements such as best management practices for nonpoint sources including timberland operations to reduce the amounts of pollutants it is not possible to estimate the capital expenditures that may be required for us to meet pollution allocations across the various proposed state tmdl programs until a specific tmdl is promulgated 

various levels of government in canada have started work to address water usage and quality issues regional watershed protection is increasing and appears to be a part of future water strategies across canada as part of our membership in the us business roundtable see change society environment and economy initiative we established a goal in may 2008 to reduce water use at our cellulose fibers mills 20 percent by 2012 using a 2007 baseline we achieved a 125 percent water use reduction in 2009 compared to our 2007 baseline

we are a large exporter affected by changes in 

 

     

 

 


 risk factors 

we are subject to certain risks and events that if one or more of them occur could adversely affect our business our financial condition our results of operations and the trading price of our common stock 

you should consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information presented in this report and the matters described in “forwardlooking statements” as well as the other reports and registration statements we file from time to time with the sec in evaluating us our business and an investment in our securities 

the risks below are not the only risks we face additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely affect our business 

 

 

risks related to our industries and business 

 

macroeconomic conditions 

the industries in which we operate are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions and consequently highly cyclical 

the overall levels of demand for the products we manufacture and distribute and consequently our sales and profitability reflect fluctuations in levels of enduser demand which depend in part on general macroeconomic conditions in north america and worldwide as well as on local economic conditions current economic conditions in the united states and the global economic downturn combined with the decreased availability of credit and high foreclosure rates has resulted in a continued weakness in the homebuilding industry including the company’s real estate business increased inventories of available new homes significant declines in home prices loss of homeequity values and loss of consumer confidence and demand our wood products segment is highly dependent on the strength of the homebuilding industry and the weakness in that industry has resulted in depressed prices of and demand for wood products and building materials this has been further reflected in declining prices and demand for logs and reduced harvests in our timberland segment the length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time and by product but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions consumer demand could continue to decline as a result of the current economic conditions further adversely affecting our businesses 

commodity products 

many of our products are commodities that are widely available from other producers 

because commodity products have few distinguishing properties from producer to producer competition for these products is based primarily on price which is determined by supply relative to demand and competition from substitute products prices for our products are affected by many factors outside of our control and we have no influence over the timing and extent of price changes which often are volatile our profitability with respect to these products depends in part on managing our costs particularly raw material and energy costs which represent significant components of our operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control prices of and demand for many of our products have declined significantly in recent quarters while many of our raw material or energy costs have increased this has adversely affected both our sales and profitability 

industry supply of logs wood products and pulp 

excess supply of products may adversely affect prices and margins 

industry supply of logs wood products and pulp is subject to changing macroeconomic and industry conditions that may cause producers to idle or permanently close individual machines or entire mills or to decrease harvest levels to avoid substantial cash costs in connection with idling or closing a mill some producers choose to continue to operate at a loss which could prolong weak prices due to oversupply oversupply of products also may result from producers introducing new capacity or increasing harvest levels in response to favorable shortterm pricing trends industry supplies of pulp also are influenced by overseas production capacity which has grown in recent years and is expected to continue to grow while the weakness of the us dollar in recent years has improved the company’s competitive position and mitigated the levels of imports the recent strengthening of the us dollar and decreases in demand for consumer products in emerging markets may result in increased imports of pulp from overseas resulting in lower prices continuation of these factors could materially and adversely affect sales volumes and margins of our operations 

  

 

 homebuilding market and economic risks 

continuing high foreclosure rates low demand and low levels of consumer confidence could continue to adversely affect our sales volume pricing and margins and result in further impairments 

demand for homes is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as the level of employment consumer confidence consumer income the availability of financing and interest rate levels during the period of 2007 through 2010 the mortgage industry experienced significant instability and increasing default rates particularly with regard to subprime and other nonconforming loans this caused many lenders to tighten credit requirements and reduce the number of mortgage loans available for financing home purchases demand for new homes also has been adversely affected by factors such as continued high unemployment accelerating foreclosure rates and distress sales of houses significant declines in home values and a collapse of consumer confidence our cancellation rates have fallen but homebuyers sometimes find it more advantageous to forfeit a deposit than to complete the purchase of the home because of the fear of further price declines 

the company has traditionally carried a larger supply of land for development than many of our competitors some of the land was purchased during the last few years land prices have fallen in these markets and may continue to fall as new housing demand in our markets has fallen significantly we have elected to sell some of our land and lots at a loss or declined to exercise options even though that required us to forfeit deposits and write off preacquisition costs we also have changed our competitive strategies in some markets and elected to discontinue or postpone development in other markets in response to the downturn as a result we continue to look for opportunities to reposition our portfolio through the sale of our assets 

our homebuyers’ ability to qualify for and obtain affordable mortgages could be affected by changes in government sponsored entities and private mortgage insurance companies supporting the mortgage market 

the federal government has historically had a significant role in supporting mortgage lending through its sponsorship of fannie mae and freddie mac as a result of turbulence in the credit markets and mortgage finance industry in the last few years the effect of the federal government’s conservatorship of these government sponsored entities on the shortterm and longterm demand for new housing remains unclear the liquidity provided to the mortgage industry by fannie mae and freddie mac both of which purchase home mortgages and mortgagebacked securities originated by mortgage lenders is critical to the housing market there have been significant concerns about the future purpose of fannie mae and freddie mac and a number of proposals to curtail their activities over time are under review any limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these entities could adversely affect interest rates mortgage financing and increase the effective cost of our homes which could reduce demand for our homes and adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in tax regulations could harm our future sales and earnings 

significant costs of homeownership include mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes both of which are generally deductible for an individual’s federal and in some cases state income taxes any changes to income tax laws by the federal government or a state government to eliminate or substantially reduce these income tax deductions as has been considered from time to time would increase the aftertax cost of owning a home increases in real estate taxes by local governmental authorities also increase the cost of homeownership any such increases to the cost of homeownership could adversely affect the demand for and sales prices of new homes 

capital markets 

recent deterioration in economic conditions and the credit markets could adversely affect our access to capital 

financial and credit markets have been experiencing a period of turmoil that has included the failure or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states government while it is difficult to predict the ultimate results of these events they may impair the company’s ability to borrow money similarly our customers may be unable to borrow money to fund their operations 

continued deteriorating or volatile market conditions could 

 

          

 

 changes in credit ratings 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results actions that we take their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing the company on a watch list for possible future downgrading downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading could limit our access to the credit markets increase our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

substitution 

some of our products are vulnerable to declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials 

our products may compete with nonfiberbased alternatives or with alternative products in certain market segments for example plastic woodplastic or composite materials may be used by builders as alternatives to the products produced by our wood products businesses such as lumber veneer plywood and oriented strand board changes in prices for oil chemicals and woodbased fiber can change the competitive position of our products relative to available alternatives and could increase substitution of those products for our products as the use of these alternatives grows demand for our products may further decline 

changes in product mix or pricing 

our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by changes in product mix or pricing 

our results may be affected by a change in our sales mix our outlook assumes a certain volume and product mix of sales if actual results vary from this projected volume and product mix of sales our operations and our results could be negatively affected our outlook also assumes we will be successful in implementing previously announced price increases as well as future price increases delays in acceptance of price increases could negatively affect our results moreover price discounting if required to maintain our competitive position could result in lower than anticipated price realizations 

intense competition 

we face intense competition in our markets and the failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we compete with north american and for many of our product lines global producers some of which may have greater financial resources and lower production costs than we do the principal basis for competition is selling price our ability to maintain satisfactory margins depends in large part on our ability to control our costs our industries are also particularly sensitive to other factors including innovation design quality and service with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line to the extent that one or more of our competitors become more successful with respect to any key competitive factor our ability to attract and retain customers could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to compete effectively such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

material disruption of manufacturing 

a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales or negatively affect our results of operation and financial condition 

any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

 

            any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products andor require us to make unplanned capital expenditures if one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired resulting in lower sales and income 

  

 

 capital requirements 

our operations require substantial capital 

the company has substantial capital requirements for expansion and repair or replacement of existing facilities or equipment although we maintain our production equipment with regular scheduled maintenance key pieces of equipment may need to be repaired or replaced periodically the costs of repairing or replacing such equipment and the associated downtime of the affected production line could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we believe our capital resources will be adequate to meet our current projected operating needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements if for any reason we are unable to provide for our operating needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements on economic terms we could experience a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

laws and regulations 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with violations of or liabilities under applicable environmental laws and other laws and regulations 

we are subject to a wide range of general and industryspecific laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing 

 

         in particular the pulp and paper industry in the united states is subject to cluster rules and boiler maximum achievable control technology rules that further regulate effluent and air emissions these laws and regulations will require us to obtain authorizations from and comply with the authorization requirements of the appropriate governmental authorities which have considerable discretion over the terms and timing of permits 

we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations and as a result of remedial obligations we also could incur substantial costs such as civil or criminal fines sanctions and enforcement actions including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions cleanup and closure costs and thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations 

as the owner and operator of real estate including in our homebuilding business we may be liable under environmental laws for cleanup closure and other damages resulting from the presence and release of hazardous substances on or from our properties or operations the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict and in some cases our liability may exceed forecasted amounts or the value of the property itself the discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at our sites or thirdparty sites may result in significant additional costs any material liability we incur could adversely affect our financial condition or preclude us from making capital expenditures that otherwise would benefit our business 

we also anticipate public policy developments at the state federal and international level regarding climate change and energy access security and competitiveness we expect these developments to address emission of carbon dioxide renewable energy and fuel standards and the monetization of carbon compliance with regulations that implement new public policy in these areas might require significant expenditures enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretation of these laws or regulations might require significant expenditures we also anticipate public policy developments at the state federal and international level regarding taxes health care and a number of other areas that could require significant expenditures 

currency exchange rates 

we will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates 

we have manufacturing operations in canada uruguay and brazil we are also a large exporter and compete with producers of products very similar to ours therefore we are affected by changes in the strength of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar euro and yen 

availability of raw materials and energy 

our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials and energy 

we rely heavily on certain raw materials principally wood fiber and chemicals and energy sources principally natural gas electricity coal and fuel oil in our manufacturing processes our ability to increase earnings has been and will continue to 

  

 

 be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials and energy sources we may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material or energy costs through hedging arrangements price increases productivity improvements or costreduction programs 

transportation 

we depend on third parties for transportation services and increases in costs and the availability of transportation could materially adversely affect our business and operations 

our business depends on the transportation of a large number of products both domestically and internationally we rely primarily on third parties for transportation of the products we manufacture andor distribute as well as delivery of our raw materials in particular a significant portion of the goods we manufacture and raw materials we use are transported by railroad or trucks which are highly regulated 

if any of our thirdparty transportation providers were to fail to deliver the goods we manufacture or distribute in a timely manner we may be unable to sell those products at full value — or at all similarly if any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner we may be unable to manufacture our products in response to customer demand in addition if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us we may be unable to replace them at reasonable cost 

any failure of a thirdparty transportation provider to deliver raw materials or finished products in a timely manner could harm our reputation negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation 

in addition an increase in transportation rates or fuel surcharges could materially adversely affect our sales and profitability 

reit status 

if we fail to qualify or remain qualified as a reit we would be subject to tax at corporate rates and would not be able to deduct dividends to shareholders when computing our taxable income because our timberrelated income will be subject to taxation 

in any taxable year we fail to qualify as a reit unless we are entitled to relief under the internal revenue code 

 

   if we fail to qualify as a reit we might need to borrow funds or liquidate some investments in order to pay the additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment or dividends to our shareholders would be reduced 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code to our operations and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions although we operate in a manner consistent with the reit qualification rules we cannot assure you that we are or will remain so qualified 

in addition federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process the internal revenue service the united states department of the treasury and state taxing authorities changes to the tax law could adversely affect our shareholders we cannot predict with certainty whether when in what forms or with what effective dates the tax laws applicable to us or our shareholders may be changed 

certain of our business activities are potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax or corporatelevel income tax 

under the internal revenue code reits generally must engage in the ownership and management of income producing real estate for the company this generally includes owning and managing a timberland portfolio for the production and sale of standing timber accordingly the manufacture and sale by us of wood products the harvesting and sale of logs and the development or sale of certain timberlands the manufacture and sale of pulp products the development of real estate the building and sale of singlefamily houses and the development and sale of land and lots for real estate development are conducted through one or more of our whollyowned taxable reit subsidiaries “trss” because such activities could generate nonqualifying reit income and could constitute “prohibited transactions” prohibited transactions are defined by the internal revenue code generally to be sales or other dispositions of property to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business by conducting our business in this manner we believe that we satisfy the reit requirements of the internal revenue code and are not subject to the 100 percent tax that could be imposed if a reit were to conduct a prohibited transaction we may not always be successful however in limiting such activities to our trss therefore we could be subject to the 100 percent prohibited transactions tax if such instances were to occur the net income of our trss is subject to corporatelevel income tax 

  

 

 the extent of our use of our trs may affect the price of our common shares relative to the share price of other reits 

we conduct a significant portion of our business activities through one or more trss our use of our trss enables us to engage in nonreit qualifying business activities such as the sale of logs production and sale of wood products and pulp products real estate development and singlefamily home sales and sale of hbu property our trss are subject to corporatelevel tax therefore we pay income taxes on the income generated by our trss under the code no more than 25 percent of the value of the gross assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trs this limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our trss’ operations furthermore our use of trss may cause the market to value our common shares differently than the shares of other reits which may not use trss as extensively as we use them 

we may be limited in our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our taxable reit subsidiaries 

the ability of the reit to receive dividends from our trs is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a reit in particular at least 75 percent of gross income for each taxable year as a reit must be derived from passive real estate sources including sales of our standing timber and other types of qualifying real estate income and no more than 25 percent of our gross income may consist of dividends from our trs and other nonreal estate income 

this limitation on our ability to receive dividends from our trss may affect our ability to fund cash distributions to our shareholders using cash flows from our trss we can however under current law issue stock dividends for up to 90 percent of our regular dividend distribution for calendar years through 2011 the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed and income that is not distributed will not be subject to the reit income distribution requirement 

our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate 

generally reits are required to distribute 90 percent of their ordinary taxable income and 95 percent of their net capital gains income capital gains may be retained by the reit but would be subject to income taxes if capital gains are retained rather than distributed our shareholders would be notified and they would be deemed to have received a taxable distribution with a refundable credit for any federal income tax paid by the reit accordingly we believe that we are not required to distribute material amounts of cash since substantially all of our taxable income is treated as capital gains income our board of directors in its sole discretion determines the amount of quarterly dividends to be provided to our shareholders based on consideration of a number of factors these factors include but are not limited to our results of operations cash flow and capital requirements economic conditions tax considerations borrowing capacity and other factors including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments future acquisitions and divestitures harvest levels changes in the price and demand for our products and general market demand for timberlands including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses consequently our dividend levels may fluctuate 

we may not be able to complete desired likekind exchange transactions for timberlands and real estate we sell 

when we sell timberlands and real estate we generally seek to match these sales with the acquisition of suitable replacement timberlands this allows us “likekind exchange” treatment for these transactions under section 1031 and related regulations of the code this matching of sales and purchases provides us with significant tax benefits most importantly the deferral of any gain on the property sold until ultimate disposition of the replacement property while we attempt to complete likekind exchanges wherever practical we may not be able to do so in all instances due to various factors including the lack of availability of suitable replacement property on acceptable terms and our inability to complete a qualifying likekind exchange transaction within the time frames required by the code the inability to obtain likekind exchange treatment would result in the payment of taxes with respect to the property sold and a corresponding reduction in earnings and cash available for distribution to shareholders as dividends 




 unresolved staff comments 

there are no unresolved comments that were received from the sec staff relating to our periodic or current reports under the securities exchange act of 1934

legal proceedings 

see note 16 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of legal proceedings 

  

 

 


 legal proceedings 

we are a party to a number of legal proceedings and adverse judgments in certain legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

the costs and other effects of pending litigation against us and related insurance recoveries cannot be determined with certainty although the disclosure in note 16 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements contains management’s current views of the effect such litigation will have on our financial results there can be no assurance that the outcome of such proceedings will be as expected 

for example there have been several lawsuits filed against us alleging that we violated us antitrust laws those included lawsuits alleging antitrust violations against us and other manufacturers of oriented strand board and lawsuits alleging antitrust violations with respect to alder logs and lumber all of these matters have been settled 

it is possible that there could be adverse judgments against us in some or all major litigation against us and that we could be 

  

 

 required to take a charge for all or a portion of any damage award any such charge could materially and adversely affect our results of operations for the quarter or year in which we record it 

export taxes 

we may be required to pay significant export taxes or countervailing and antidumping duties for exported products 

we may experience reduced revenues and margins on some of our businesses as a result of export taxes or countervailing and antidumping duty applications for example in 2001 a group of companies filed petitions with the us department of commerce and the international trade commission claiming that production of softwood lumber in canada was being subsidized by canada and that imports into the us from canada were being sold in us markets at less than their fair value we have softwood lumber facilities in canada that export lumber into the us we paid a total of 370 million in deposits for countervailing duty and antidumping tariffs from 2002 through 2006 related to those lumber exports the us and canadian governments reached a settlement of the dispute in 2006 as a result of the settlement we received a refund of 344 million fourth quarter 2006 however our canadian softwood lumber facilities will have to pay an export tax when the price of lumber is at or below a threshold price the export tax could be as high as 225 percent if a province exceeds its total allotted export share similar types of actions have been initiated from time to time against us and other us producers of products such as paper or lumber by countries such as china and korea it is possible that countervailing duty and antidumping tariffs or similar types of tariffs could be imposed on us in the future we may experience reduced revenues and margins in any business that is subject to such tariffs or to the terms of the settlements of such international disputes these tariffs or settlement terms could have a material adverse effect on our business financial results and financial condition including facility closures or impairments of assets 

natural disasters 

our business and operations could be adversely affected by weather fire infestation or natural disasters 

our timberlands assets may be damaged by adverse weather severe wind and rainstorms fires pest infestation or other natural disasters because our manufacturing processes primarily use wood fiber in many cases from our own timberlands in the event of material damage to our timberlands our operations could be disrupted or our production costs could be increased 

 

 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

 

stockprice volatility 

the price of our common stock may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors some of which are beyond our control including those described above under “risks related to our industries and business” and the following 

 

       in addition there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in the forest products industry that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 

some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them if litigation of this type is brought against us it could result in substantial costs and would divert management’s attention and resources

   given our changes in our asset portfolio decreased size and conversion to a real estate investment trust in 2010 we believe our prior performance peers no longer best reflect our industry and lineof business therefore we selected the sp global timber  forestry index as our peer index going forward the sp global timber  forestry index is comprised of 25 of the largest publicly traded companies engaged in the ownership management or the upstream supply chain of forests and timberlands

what you will find in this mda 

 

our mda includes the following major sections 

 

         

 

real estate investment trust reit conversion 

 

our board of directors has determined that conversion to a reit best supports our strategic direction for tax purposes this change was effective january 1 2010 

we expect to derive most of our reit income from investments in timberlands including the sale of standing timber through payascut sale contracts reit income can be distributed to shareholders without first paying corporate level tax substantially eliminating the double taxation on income a significant portion of our timberland segment earnings will receive this favorable tax treatment we will however be subject to corporate taxes on builtingains the excess of fair market value over tax basis at january 1 2010 on sales of real property other than standing timber held by the reit during the first 10 years following the reit conversion we also will continue to be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on earnings of our trs which principally includes our manufacturing businesses our real estate development business and our nonqualified timberland segment income following are points related to our conversion 

 

     

 

economic and market conditions affecting our operations 

 

the us economy has gradually begun its recovery from the most severe recession since the 1930’s however the housing market continues to lag other sectors in the recovery and remains burdened by excess inventory and a diminished pool of qualified homebuyers the health of the us housing market strongly affects our real estate wood products and timberlands segments real estate focuses on building single family homes wood products primarily sells into the new residential building and repair and remodel markets demand for logs from our timberlands segment is affected by the production of woodbased building products cellulose fibers is primarily affected by global demand and the value of the us dollar 

housing market 

we track certain indicators such as employment consumer confidence housing starts home sales foreclosures home prices mortgage interest rates and the number of homes for sale to assess housing market conditions 

throughout 2010 the unemployment rate has remained well above 9 percent but as of december had fallen to 94 percent the lowest level for the year weak employment growth contributed to weak consumer confidence limiting any growth in demand for housing and wood products total us housing starts for 2010 were 586 thousand units with single family 

  

 

 units accounting for 472 thousand of the total this represents a modest 6 percent gain in total starts over 2009 but remains well below the 1992 through 2007 annual levels of over 1 million single family starts the number of mortgages in default remains very large and the number of foreclosures is expected to remain high relative to historic trends this will continue to contribute to the inventory of existing homes which limits demand for new homes new home sales in the us totaled 321 thousand units in 2010 this low level of new home sales last occurred in 1963 and is a decrease of 14 percent from 2009 the previous record low at the peak in 2005 new home sales were 128 million 

demand for wood products continued to be affected by the depressed level of new home construction in 2010 overall demand levels for lumber increased 4 percent from 2009 while demand for oriented strand board osb which is more heavily dependent on residential construction declined 3 percent from 2009 levels demand for both lumber and osb remain 36 percent to 38 percent below peak levels as a result industry operating rates for lumber and osb averaged between 70 and 80 percent of capacity product prices were subject to significant fluctuations in 2010 as a result of low inventories and relatively weak demand most prices peaked in the second quarter coinciding with the strongest quarter of construction only to decrease to levels closer to their costs of production for much of the year demand for logs increased as lumber production increased slightly in the western region weak domestic demand for logs was offset somewhat by demand from japan china and korea resulting in increases for western log prices 

us dollarglobal demand 

the us dollar has weakened relative to most developed world currencies over 2010 cellulose fibers benefitted from the decline in the value of the us dollar as our pulp mills became more competitive compared to european canadian and south american producers 

the combination of the weaker dollar steady global demand and decreased capacity resulted in a 41 percent increase in the key indicator northern bleached softwood kraft nbsk pulp price in 2010 over 2009 pulp prices started the year above 2009 levels and increased further as global supplies were strained by production interruptions in chile due to earthquakes the combination of restarted chilean mills and the production response to higher prices led to a gradual retreat in the key nbsk indicator price in fourth quarter 

the weaker dollar compared to the yen resulted in us logs being cheaper total housing starts in japan increased 2 percent from 2009 levels however wooden housing starts a key factor influencing demand for export logs increased almost 8 percent on a year over year basis the export log market was affected by increased demand from china chinese imports of softwood logs from the us are estimated at 24 million cubic meters for 2010 an increase of 400 percent from 2009 

where we are headed 

the us economy has continued to grow through fourth quarter 2010 and into 2011 but there has been no meaningful job growth in the first quarter of 2011 singlefamily starts are expected to be higher in the first quarter as a result of the record low inventory of new homes for sale demand for wood products is expected to increase seasonally however some of this is expected to result from the rebuilding of inventories by dealers and wholesalers sustainable demand growth is expected to be modest in 2011 log prices are expected to rise as a result of the increased seasonal domestic demand for wood products and increasing offshore demand the us dollar is expected to remain weak by comparison to the euro and the canadian dollar which will increase the competitive position of us market pulp producers

comparing 2009 with 2008 

net cash used in operations decreased 11 billion in 2009 as compared with 2008 due to the following 

 

     fuel credits 

during 2009 the us internal revenue code allowed a 050 per gallon tax credit for the alternative fuel component of alternative fuel mixtures produced and used as a fuel in a taxpayer’s trade or business our application for registration as a blender based on our use of black liquor as an alternative fuel was approved in may 2009 we began blending black liquor a byproduct of our wood pulping process and diesel fuel during the first week of april 2009 and blended and used approximately 688 million gallons of the alternative fuel mixture through december 31 2009 resulting in 344 million of credits the alternative fuel mixture credit expired on december 31 2009 

in an irs memo dated june 28 2010 the irs concluded that black liquor sold or used in 2009 qualifies for the cellulosic biofuel producer credit with the recognition that black liquor potentially qualifies for either the cellulosic biofuel producer credit or the alternative fuel mixture credit but not both on the same gallon of black liquor the irs has provided instructions that would allow a taxpayer to refund alternative fuel mixture credits already received and claim the higher cellulosic biofuel producer credit we received our registration as a cellulosic biofuel producer in third quarter 2010 in an irs memo dated october 5 2010 the irs concluded that both the alternative fuel mixture credit and the cellulosic biofuel producer credit could be claimed by a taxpayer in the same year during 2009 we produced approximately 238 million gallons of black liquor which did not qualify for the alternative fuel mixture credit this equals 240 million of potential cellulosic biofuel producer credit at 101 per gallon or 149 million net of tax which we recognized in fourth quarter 2010 since this credit offsets our income tax liability we will carry the credit forward

paying dividends and repurchasing stock 

we paid dividends of 

 

   the increase in dividends paid during 2010 is due to the special dividend paid on september 1 2010 as part of our conversion to a reit 

changes in the amount of dividends we paid during 2009 and 2008 were primarily due to the decrease in our quarterly dividend from 60 cents to 25 cents in december 2008 and to 5 cents in july 2009 

our board considered several factors in regards to an appropriate dividend level following reit conversion considerations included the macroeconomic climate our earnings potential affordability our target capital structure funding for potential growth opportunities and comparability to other timber reit dividend practices during december 2010 we provided updated guidance on our dividend level for 2011 by announcing that we expect to pay quarterly dividends of 15 cents per share or 60 cents per share on an annualized basis on february 10 2011 our board declared a dividend of 15 cents per share payable on march 15 2011 

in december of 2008 the board of directors authorized the additional repurchase of up to 250 million of the company’s outstanding shares during 2009 we repurchased 66691 shares of common stock at a cost of 2 million under the stockrepurchase program we have not repurchased any more common shares since 2009

 pension and postretirement benefit plans 

we sponsor several pension and postretirement benefit plans for our employees key assumptions we use in accounting for the plans include our 

 

     at the end of every year we review our assumptions with external advisers and make adjustments as appropriate actual experience that differs from our assumptions or any changes in our assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

other factors that affect our accounting for the plans include 

 

     this section provides more information about our 

 

   expected longterm rate of returns 

plan assets are assets of the pension plan trusts that fund the benefits provided under the pension plans the expected longterm rate of return is our estimate of the longterm rate of return that our plan assets will earn after considering all available information at the end of 2010 we continue to assume an expected longterm rate of return of 95 percent factors we considered include 

 

  our expected longterm rate of return is important in determining the net income or expense we recognize for our plans every 05 percent decrease in our expected longterm rate of return would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately 

 

  likewise every 05 percent increase in our expected longterm rate of return would decrease expense or increase a credit by those same amounts 

the actual return on plan assets in any given year may vary from our expected longterm rate of return actual returns on plan assets affect the funded status of the plans differences between actual returns on plan assets and the expected longterm rate of return are reflected as adjustments to cumulative other comprehensive income loss a component of total equity 

discount rate 

our discount rate as of december 31 2010 is 

 

    we review our discount rates annually and revise them as needed the discount rates are selected at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of highquality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits 

pension and postretirement benefit expenses for 2011 will be based on the 54 percent and 50 percent assumed discount rates for us plans and the 53 percent and 52 percent assumed discount rates for the canadian plans 

our discount rate is important in determining the cost of our plans a 05 percent decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately

    longlived assets 

we review the carrying value of our longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations the carrying value is the amount assigned to longlived assets in our books 

an impairment occurs when the carrying value of longlived assets will not be recovered from future cash flows and is less than fair market value fair market value is the estimated amount we would get if we were to sell the assets 

in determining fair market value and whether impairment has occurred we are required to estimate 

 

   key assumptions we use in developing the estimates include 

 

     impairment of longlived assets real estate 

we review homebuilding longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable we recorded longlived homebuilding asset impairments and related charges attributable to weyerhaeuser shareholders of 21 million in 2010 261 million in 2009 and 11 billion in 2008 

real estate held for development 

real estate held for development includes subdivisions and master planned communities mpcs mpcs typically include several product segments such as residential active adult retail and commercial we evaluate impairment at the subdivision or mpc product segment level factors that are considered when evaluating a subdivision or mpc product segment for impairment include 

 

    we update the undiscounted cash flow forecast for each subdivision and mpc product segment that may be impaired the undiscounted cash flow forecasts are affected by communityspecific factors that include 

 

      the carrying amount of each subdivision and mpc product segment is written down to fair value when the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of a subdivision or mpc product segment an impairment charge for a subdivision or mpc product segment is allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot 

real estate held for sale 

real estate held for sale includes homes that have been completed and land that we intend to sell we regularly sell land or lots that do not fit our value proposition or development plans 

the carrying amount of real estate held for sale is reduced to fair value less estimated costs to sell if the forecasted net proceeds are less than the carrying amount the fair value analysis is affected by local market economic conditions demographic factors and competitor actions and is inherently 

  

 

 uncertain actual net proceeds can differ from the estimates the carrying amount of real estate held for sale is evaluated quarterly 

market approach 

we use the market approach to determine fair value of real estate held for development and held for sale when information for comparable assets is available this approach is commonly used for our active projects where we are selling product we typically use 

 

    income approach 

we generally use the income approach to determine fair value of real estate for our inactive projects the income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example cash flows or earnings to a single present amount discounted the fair value measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations regarding those future estimated cash inflows and outflows we use present value techniques based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams discount rates applied to the estimated future cash flows of our homebuilding assets in 2010 ranged from 15 percent to 18 percent the income approach relies on management judgment regarding the various inputs to the undiscounted cash flow forecasts 

contingent liabilities 

we are subject to lawsuits investigations and other claims related to environmental product and other matters and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 

we record contingent liabilities when 

 

  assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors including 

 

   in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that an ultimate loss may occur 

while we do our best in developing our projections recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain if estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges in other income expense net these exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flow in any given quarter or year see note 16 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

depletion 

we record depletion — the costs attributed to timber harvested — as trees are harvested 

to calculate our depletion rate which is updated annually we 

 

  estimating the volume of timber available for harvest over the harvest cycle requires the consideration of the following factors 

 

       in addition the length of the harvest cycle varies by geographic region and species of timber 

depletionrate calculations do not include estimates for 

 

   prospective accounting pronouncements 

currently there are no significant prospective accounting pronouncements that are expected to have an impact on us 

  

 

 


 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

 

longterm debt obligations 

 

the following summary of our longterm debt obligations includes 

 

   we estimate the fair value of longterm debt based on quoted market prices we received for the same types and issues of our debt or on the discounted value of the future cash flows using market yields for the same type and comparable issues of debt changes in market rates of interest affect the fair value of our fixedrate debt

international operations in this segment consist principally of forest plantations forest licenses and converting assets in south america we serve as managing partner in these operations which are either whollyowned subsidiaries or joint ventures in china we are the managing partner in a joint venture established in 2007 we own 51 percent of this joint venture and fujian yong’an forestry company owns the remaining 49 percent as of december 31 2009 the joint venture managed 45000 acres of timberlands with 486000 seedlings planted in 2009 

sustainable forestry practices 

we are committed to responsible environmental stewardship wherever we operate managing forests to produce financially mature timber while protecting the ecosystem services they provide our working forests include places with unique environmental cultural historical or recreational value to protect their unique qualities we follow regulatory requirements voluntary standards and implement the sustainable forestry initiative ® sfi standard independent auditing of all of the forests we own or manage in the united states certifies that we meet the sfi standard in canada we certify our forests to the canadian standards association csa standard our forestlands in uruguay are the model for the developing uruguayan national forest certification standard and we have designed them to meet the program for the endorsement of forest certification pefc 

  

canadian forestry operations 

in canada we have licenses to operate forestlands that provide the volume for our manufacturing units in various provinces when we harvest trees we pay the provinces at stumpage rates set by the government and generally based on prevailing market prices we do not generate any profit in the timberlands segment from the harvest of timber from the licensed acres in canada 

other values from our timberlands 

in the united states we actively manage mineral oil and gas leases on our land and use geologic databases to identify and market opportunities for commercial mineral and geothermal development we recognize leasing revenue over the terms of agreements with customers revenue primarily comes from 

 

     in managing mineral resources we generate revenue related to our ownership of the minerals and separately related to our ownership of the surface the ownership of mineral rights and surface acres may be held by two separate parties materials that can be mined from the surface and whose value comes from factors other than their chemical composition typically belong to the surface owner examples of surface materials include rock sand gravel dirt and topsoil the mineral owner holds the title to commodities that derive value from their unique chemical composition examples of mineral rights include oil gas coal even if mined at the surface and precious metals if the two types of rights conflict then mineral rights are generally superior to surface rights a third type of land right is geothermal which can belong to either the surface or mineral owner we routinely reserve mineral and geothermal rights when selling surface timberlands acreage

how we measure our product 

we report timberlands data in cubic meters cubic meters measure the total volume of wood fiber in a tree or log that we can sell cubic meter volume is determined from the large and smallend diameters and length and provides a more consistent and comparative measure of timber and log volume among operating regions species size and seasons of the year than other units of measure 

we also use two other units of measure when transacting business including 

 

  both measures are accurate in the regions they are used but they do not provide a meaningful basis for comparisons between the regions 

the conversion rate for mbf to cubic meters varies based on several factors including diameter length and taper of the timber the average conversion rate for mbf to cubic meters is approximately 67 cubic meters per mbf 

the conversion rate from green tons to cubic meters also varies based on the season harvested and the specific gravity of the wood for the region where the timber is grown an average conversion rate for green tons to cubic meters is approximately 0825 cubic meters per green ton 

where we do it 

our timberlands assets are located primarily in north america in the us we own and manage sustainable forests in nine states for use in wood products and pulp and paper manufacturing we own or lease 

 

  our international operations are located primarily in uruguay and china where as of december 31 2009 we own a total of 315000 acres and have longterm leases on another 71000 acres 

in addition we have renewable longterm licenses on 152 million acres of forestland owned by the provincial government of four canadian provinces 

  

our total timber inventory — including timber on owned and leased land in our us and international operations — is approximately 306 million cubic meters the timber inventory on licensed lands in canada is approximately 383 million cubic meters the amount of timber inventory does not translate into an amount of lumber or panel products because the quantity of end products 

 

  the species size and grade of the trees affects the relative value of our timberlands 

discussion of operations by geography 

summary of 2009 timber inventory and timberland locations 

united states 

 

 western united states 

our western acres are well situated to serve the wood product markets in oregon and washington their location near weyerhaeuser mills and many thirdparty facilities allows for multiple sales opportunities in addition our location on the west coast provides access to highervalue export markets for douglas fir and hemlock logs in japan korea and china the size and quality of our western timberlands coupled with their proximity to several deepwater port facilities positions us to meet the needs of pacific rim log markets 

our lands are composed primarily of douglas fir a species highly valued for its structural strength our coastal lands also contain western hemlock but to a lesser degree than our fir stands our management systems which provide us a competitive operating advantage range from research and forestry to technical planning models mechanized harvesting and marketing and logistics 

the average age of timber harvested in 2009 was 50 years most of our us timberland is intensively managed for timber production but some areas are conserved for environmental historical recreational or cultural reasons some of our older 

  

   

trees are protected in acreage set aside for conservation and some are not yet logged due to harvest rate regulations while over the long term our average harvest age will decrease in accordance with our sustainable forestry practices we will only harvest approximately 15 percent of our western acreage each year 

southern united states 

our southern acres predominantly contain southern yellow pine and encompass timberlands in seven states this area provides a constant year round flow of logs to a variety of internal and thirdparty customers we sell grade logs to mills that manufacture a diverse range of products including lumber plywood and veneer we also sell chips and fiber logs to oriented strand board pulp and paper mills our timberlands are well located to take advantage of road logging and transportation systems for efficient delivery of logs to these customers 

we intensively manage our timber plantations using forestry research and planning systems to optimize grade log production we also actively manage our land to capture revenues from our oil gas and hard minerals resources we do this while providing quality habitat for a range of animals and birds which is in high demand for recreational purposes we lease more than 95 percent of our acres to the public and state wildlife agencies for recreational purposes 

the average age of timber harvested in 2009 was 31 years for southern yellow pine in accordance with our sustainable forestry practices we harvest approximately 30 percent to 35 percent of our acreage each year in the south 

international 

 

 our forestlands in uruguay are approximately 50 percent loblolly pine and 50 percent eucalyptus on average the timber in uruguay is in the first third of its rotation age it is entering into that part of the growth rotation when we will see increased volume accretion about 80 percent of the area to be planted has been afforested to date the afforestation program is planned to be completed within the next four years 

  

in uruguay the target rotation ages are 21 to 22 years for pine and 14 to 17 years for eucalyptus we manage both species to a grade appearance regime 

we also operate a plywood mill in uruguay with a production capacity of 140000 cubic meters and a production volume of 80000 cubic meters reached in 2009 construction to more than double this capacity is under way and is expected to be completed in 2010 

in brazil weyerhaeuser is a managing partner in a joint venture we own 67 percent and fibria cellulose sa owns 33 percent a hardwood sawmill with 72000 cubic meters of capacity produces highvalue eucalyptus lyptus ®  lumber and related appearance wood products the mill’s production in 2009 was 60000 cubic meters 

our investment in china is a joint venture with a public company that is controlled by the state and local governments weyerhaeuser is the managing partner in a joint venture started in 2007 ownership is 51 percent weyerhaeuser and 49 percent fujian yong’an forestry company the joint venture currently manages 45000 acres of timberlands with 486000 seedlings planted in 2009 

in china the target rotation age is seven years since we are managing the forests of loblolly pine and eucalyptus for fiber 

canada — licensed timberlands 

 

 we lease and license forestland in canada from the provincial government to secure the volume for our manufacturing units in the various provinces when the volume is harvested we pay the province at stumpage rates set by the government and generally based on prevailing market prices the harvested logs are transferred to our manufacturing facilities at cost stumpage plus harvest haul and overhead costs less any margin on selling logs to third parties any conversion profit is recognized at the respective mill in either the cellulose fibers or wood products segment 

  

   

fiveyear summary of timberlands production 

 

 our timberlands annual fee depletion represents the harvest of the timber assets we own depletion is a method of expensing the cost of establishing the fee timber asset base over the harvest or timber sales volume the decline in fee depletion from 2008 through 2009 reflects the company’s decision to defer harvest and preserve the longterm value of the assets

log sales volumes 

logs sold to unaffiliated customers in 2009 decreased approximately 14 million cubic meters — 14 percent — from 2008 

 

    we sell three grades of logs — domestic grade domestic fiber and export factors that may affect log sales in each of these categories include 

 

     

all our domestic and export logs are sold to unaffiliated customers or transferred at market prices to our internal mills by the sales and marketing staff within our timberlands business units

 log prices 

the majority of our log sales to unaffiliated customers involves sales to the export market and to other domestic sawmills in the pacific northwest following is a fiveyear summary of selected export log prices 

fiveyear summary of selected export log prices 

2 sawlog bark on — mbf 

our log prices are affected by the supply of and demand for grade and fiber logs and are influenced by the same factors that affect log sales export log prices are particularly affected by the japanese housing market 

average 2009 log realizations in the west and south decreased from 2008 — primarily due to lower domestic log prices caused by the steep decline in lumber prices during the year western 

  

   

export prices also declined due to the weak japanese economy export prices were also influenced by the lower domestic prices 

minerals and energy products 

mineral revenue increased in 2009 decreased royalties from oil and gas and mining was offset by increases in oil and gas leasing revenues and revenues from the sale of selected oil and gas producing properties royalty revenue decreased as a result of weaker energy prices and reduced demand for construction aggregates new drilling activity in the haynesville shale area in north louisiana increased dramatically in late 2009 but due to the timing of initial production the effect on revenue was small the company continued to explore geothermal opportunities in washington and oregon and entered into a lease for wind power development in washington 

catchlight energy 

catchlight energy is weyerhaeuser’s joint venture with chevron which is focused on the commercialization of liquid transportation fuels produced from conversion of forestbased material during 2009 catchlight was engaged in research and development work in the areas of sustainability feedstock sourcing and scalability and conversion technologies catchlight energy also spent time developing relationships with selected technology partners results of catchlight energy are reported in the corporate and other segment

natural resource an d environmental matters 

 

many social values are expressed in the laws and regulations that pertain to growing and harvesting timber we participate in voluntary certification of our timberlands to assure that we sustain their values including the protection of wildlife and water quality we are also subject to laws regulating forestry practices changes in law and regulation can significantly affect local or regional timber harvest levels and market values of timberbased raw materials 

endangered species protecti ons 

in the united states a number of fish and wildlife species that inhabit geographic areas near or within our timberlands have been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal endangered species act esa or similar state laws some of these listed species include the northern spotted owl the marbled murrelet a number of salmon species bull trout and steelhead trout in the pacific northwest and the redcockaded woodpecker gopher tortoise and american burying beetle in the southeast additional species or populations may be listed as threatened or endangered as a result of pending or future citizen petitions or petitions initiated by federal or state agencies 

federal and state requirements to protect habitat for threatened and endangered species have resulted in restrictions on timber harvest on some timberlands including some of our timberlands additional listings of fish and wildlife species as endangered threatened or sensitive under the esa or similar state laws as well as regulatory actions taken by federal or state agencies to protect habitat for these species may in the future result in additional restrictions on our timber harvests and other forest management practices they also could increase our operating costs and affect timber supply and prices in general 

in canada the federal species at risk act sara requires protective measures for species identified as being at risk and for critical habitat environment canada announced a series of western science studies in 2010 that with other landscape information are designed to identify critical habitat the identification and protection of habitat may over time result in additional restrictions on timber harvests and other forest management practices that could increase operating costs for operators of forestlands in canada to date these canadian measures have not had and in 2010 will not have a significant effect on our harvesting operations we anticipate that future measures will not disproportionally affect weyerhaeuser as compared with comparable operations 

  

regulations affecti ng forestry practices 

in the united states regulations established by federal state and local governments or agencies to protect water quality and wetlands could affect future harvests and forest management practices on some of our timberlands forest practice acts in some states in the united states increasingly affect present or future harvest and forest management activities for example in some states these acts limit the size of clearcuts require some timber to be left unharvested to protect water quality and fish and wildlife habitat regulate construction and maintenance of forest roads require reforestation following timber harvest and contain procedures for state agencies to review and approve proposed forest practice activities some states and local governments regulate certain forest practices through various permit programs each state in which we own timberlands has developed best management practices to reduce the effects of forest practices on water quality and aquatic habitats additional and more stringent regulations may be adopted by various state and local governments to achieve waterquality standards under the federal clean water act protect fish and wildlife habitats or achieve other public policy objectives 

our forest operations in canada are carried out on public forestlands under forest licenses all forest operations are subject to forest practices and environmental regulations and operations under licenses also are subject to contractual requirements between us and the relevant province designed to protect environmental and other social values 

forest certification sta ndards 

we operate in the united states under the sustainable forestry initiative ®  this is a certification standard designed to supplement government regulatory programs with voluntary landowner initiatives to further protect certain public resources and values the sustainable forestry initiative ® is an independent standard overseen by a governing board consisting of conservation organizations academia the forest industry and large and small forest landowners compliance with the sustainable forestry initiative ® may result in some increases in our operating costs and curtailment of our timber harvests in some areas in canada we participate in the sustainable forestry initiative ® and the canadian standards association sustainable forest management system standard a voluntary certification system that further protects certain public resources and values compliance with these standards will result in some increases in our operating costs and curtailment of our timber harvests in some areas in canada 

what these re gulations and certification programs mean to us 

the regulatory and nonregulatory forest management programs described above have increased our operating costs resulted 

  

   

in changes in the value of timber and logs from our timberlands and contributed to increases in the prices paid for wood products and wood chips during periods of high demand these kinds of programs also can make it more difficult for us to respond to rapid changes in markets extreme weather or other unexpected circumstances one additional effect may be further reductions in the usage of or substitution of other products for lumber and plywood we believe that these kinds of programs have not had and in 2010 will not have a significant effect on the total harvest of timber in the united states or canada however these kinds of programs may have such an effect in the future we expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these programs as compared with typical owners of comparable timberlands we also expect that these programs will not significantly disrupt our planned operations over large areas or for extended periods 

canadian aborigin al rights 

many of the canadian forestlands are subject to the constitutionally protected treaty or commonlaw rights of aboriginal peoples of canada most of british columbia bc is not covered by treaties and as a result the claims of bc’s aboriginal peoples relating to forest resources are largely unresolved although many aboriginal groups are engaged in treaty discussions with the governments of bc and canada final or interim resolution of claims brought by aboriginal groups is expected to result in additional restrictions on the sale or harvest of timber and may increase operating costs and affect timber supply and prices in canada we believe that such claims will not have a significant effect on our total harvest of timber or production of forest products in 2010 although they may have such an effect in the future in 2008 the forest products association of canada fpac of which we are a member signed a memorandum of understanding with the assembly of first nations under which the parties agree to work together to strengthen canada’s forest sector through economicdevelopment initiatives and business investments strong environmental stewardship and the creation of skilldevelopment opportunities particularly targeted to aboriginal youth 

pollutioncontrol regulat ions 

our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local pollution controls with regard to air water and land solid and hazardous waste management and disposal and remediation laws and regulations in all areas in which we have operations we also are subject to market demands with respect to chemical content of some of our products compliance with these laws regulations and demands usually involves capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs we cannot easily quantify the future amounts of capital expenditures we might have to make to comply with these laws regulations and demands or the effects on our operating costs because in some instances compliance standards have not been developed or have not become final or definitive in addition it is difficult to isolate the environmental component of most manufacturing capital projects our capital projects typically are designed to enhance safety extend the life of a facility increase capacity increase efficiency change raw material requirements or increase the economic value of assets or products as well as to comply with regulatory standards we estimate that our capital expenditures made primarily for environmental compliance were approximately 1 million in 2009 approximately 1 percent of total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and real estate based on our understanding of current regulatory requirements in the us and canada we expect that capital expenditures for environmental compliance will be approximately 1 million in 2010 approximately 1 percent of expected total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and real estate 

environmental c leanup 

we are involved in the environmental investigation or remediation of numerous sites of these sites we may have the sole obligation to remediate or may share that obligation with one or more parties in some instances several parties have joint and several obligations to remediate some sites are superfund sites where we have been named as a potentially responsible party our liability with respect to these various sites ranges from insignificant to substantial the amount of liability depends on the quantity toxicity and nature of materials at the site and depends on the number and economic viability of the other responsible parties 

we spent approximately 5 million in 2009 and expect to spend approximately 8 million in 2010 on environmental remediation of these sites it is our policy to accrue for environmentalremediation costs when we determine it is probable that such an obligation exists and can reasonably estimate the amount of the obligation we currently believe it is reasonably possible that our costs to remediate all the identified sites may exceed our current accruals of 31 million the excess amounts required may be insignificant or could range in the aggregate up to approximately 30 million over several years this estimate of the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs is much less certain than the estimates we currently are using to determine how much to accrue the estimate of the upper range also uses assumptions less favorable to us among the range of reasonably possible outcomes 

regulation of air emissions in the us 

the united states environmental protection agency epa has promulgated regulations for air emissions from pulp and paper manufacturing facilities wood products facilities and industrial 

  

   

boilers these regulations cover hazardous air pollutants that require use of maximum achievable control technology mact and controls for pollutants that contribute to smog and haze the us court of appeals for the dc circuit issued decisions in 2007 vacating the mact standards for air emissions from industrial boilers and process heaters and remanding the standards for plywood and composite wood products to the epa the epa must promulgate supplemental mact standards for plywood and composite products and new mact standards for boilers pending final action by the epa some states may implement mact requirements for boilers on a casebycase basis we anticipate that we might spend as much as 30 million to 100 million over the next few years to comply with the mact standards after they have been determined by the epa and the states we cannot currently quantify the amount of capital we will need in the future to comply with new regulations being developed by the epa or canadian environmental agencies because final rules have not been promulgated 

we closely monitor legislative regulatory and scientific developments pertaining to climate change in 2006 as part of the company’s sustainability program we adopted a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2020 compared with our emissions in 2000 assuming a comparable portfolio and regulations we intend to achieve this goal by increasing energy efficiency and using more greenhouse gasneutral biomass fuels instead of fossil fuels 2008 data indicates that we have reduced greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 10 percent considering changes in the asset portfolio 

in 2007 the us supreme court ruled that greenhouse gases are pollutants that can be subject to regulation under the clean air act in 2009 the epa proposed regulations for reporting and controlling greenhouse gas emissions that are applicable to our manufacturing operations some state governments also have released policy proposals that indicate they may regulate greenhouse gas emissions in the future in addition congress is considering and may adopt legislation regulating greenhouse gas emissions within the next few years it is not yet known when and to what extent these federal and state policy activities may come into force or how any future federal and state greenhouse gas regulatory programs may relate to each other a multistate and federal greenhouse gas emissions reduction trading system may be put in place in the future with potentially significant implications for all us businesses we believe these measures have not had and in 2010 will not have a significant effect on our operations although they may have such an effect in the future we expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with typical owners of comparable operations we maintain an active forestry research program to track and understand any potential effect from actual climate change related parameters that could affect the forests we own and manage and do not anticipate any disruptions to our planned operations 

regulation of air em issions in canada 

we participate in negotiations between the fpac and natural resources canada to define industry obligations for complying with canada’s national plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions over the next several years fpac continues to work with international national and regional policy makers in their efforts to develop technically sound and economically viable policies practices and procedures for measuring reporting and managing greenhouse gas emissions 

in 2007 the canadian federal government proposed a regulatory framework for air emissions that adopted some aspects of the kyoto protocol the federal framework called for mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for heavy industrial emissions producers among other measures to be put in place by 2010 the proposed canadian framework is currently being redesigned to conform to anticipated international cap and trade programs in addition environment canada has reduced the greenhouse gas emission reporting threshold for carbon dioxide equivalents 

canadian provincial governments also are working on emissionsreduction strategies several provinces have adopted rules requiring reporting of greenhouse gas emissions by large emitters and some provinces require reductions by large emitters new provincial requirements for reductions in emissions are anticipated in 2010 the canadian federal government and most provinces also are considering implementing new or revised emission standards for particulate matter volatile organic compounds nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides 

we believe these measures have not had and in 2010 will not have a significant effect on our operations although they may have such an effect in the future we expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with typical owners of comparable operations we also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations 

potential changes in pollutio n regulation 

state governments continue to promulgate total maximum daily load tmdl requirements for pollutants in water bodies that do not meet state or epa water quality standards state tmdl requirements may set limits on pollutants that may be discharged to a body of water or set additional requirements such as best management practices for nonpoint sources including timberland operations to reduce the amounts of pollutants it is not possible to estimate the capital expenditures that may be required for us to meet pollution allocations across the various proposed state tmdl programs until a specific tmdl is promulgated 

  

   

various levels of government in canada have started work to address water usage and quality issues regional watershed protection is increasing and appears to be a part of future water strategies across canada as part of our membership in the us business roundtable see change society environment and economy initiative we established a goal in may 2008 to reduce water use at our cellulose fibers mills 20 percent by 2012 using a 2007 baseline we achieved a 10 percent water use reduction in 2008 compared to our 2007 baseline

the overall levels of demand for the products we manufacture and distribute and consequently our sales and profitability reflect fluctuations in levels of enduser demand which depend in part on general macroeconomic conditions in north america and worldwide as well as on local economic conditions current economic conditions in the united states and the global economic downturn combined with the decreased availability of credit and high foreclosure rates has resulted in a continued weakness in the homebuilding industry including the company’s real estate business increased inventories of available new homes significant declines in home prices loss of homeequity values and loss of consumer confidence and demand our wood products segment is highly dependent on the strength of the homebuilding industry and the weakness in that industry has resulted in depressed prices of and demand for wood products and building materials this has been further reflected in declining prices and demand for logs and reduced harvests in our timberland segment the length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time and by product but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions consumer demand could continue to decline as a result of the current economic conditions further adversely affecting our businesses 

  

commod ity products 

many of our products are commodities that are widely available from other producers 

because commodity products have few distinguishing properties from producer to producer competition for these products is based primarily on price which is determined by supply relative to demand and competition from substitute products prices for our products are affected by many factors outside of our control and we have no influence over the timing and extent of price changes which often are volatile our profitability with respect to these products depends in part on managing our costs particularly raw material and energy costs which represent significant components of our operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control prices of and demand for many of our products have declined significantly in recent quarters while many of our raw material or energy costs have increased this has adversely affected both our sales and profitability 

indust ry supply of logs wood products and pulp 

excess supply of products may adversely affect prices and margins 

industry supply of logs wood products and pulp is subject to changing macroeconomic and industry conditions that may cause producers to idle or permanently close individual machines or entire mills or to decrease harvest levels to avoid substantial cash costs in connection with idling or closing a mill some producers choose to continue to operate at a loss which could prolong weak prices due to oversupply oversupply of products also may result from producers introducing new capacity or increasing harvest levels in response to favorable shortterm pricing trends industry supplies of pulp also are influenced by overseas production capacity which has grown in recent years and is expected to continue to grow while the weakness of the us dollar in recent years has improved the company’s competitive position and mitigated the levels of imports the recent strengthening of the us dollar and decreases in demand for consumer products in emerging markets may result in increased imports of pulp from overseas resulting in lower prices continuation of these factors could materially and adversely affect sales volumes and margins of our operations 

  

   

homebuilding market and economic risks 

continuing high foreclosure rates low demand and low levels of consumer confidence could continue to adversely affect our sales volume pricing and margins and result in further impairments 

demand for homes is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as the level of employment consumer confidence consumer income the availability of financing and interest rate levels during the period of 2007 through 2009 the mortgage industry experienced significant instability and increasing default rates particularly with regard to subprime and other nonconforming loans this caused many lenders to tighten credit requirements and reduce the number of mortgage loans available for financing home purchases demand for new homes also has been adversely affected by factors such as continued high unemployment accelerating foreclosure rates and distress sales of houses significant declines in home values and a collapse of consumer confidence our cancellation rates have fallen but homebuyers sometimes find it more advantageous to forfeit a deposit than to complete the purchase of the home because of the fear of further price declines these factors have resulted in reduced margins and prices and a higher level of sales incentives in many of our markets 

the company has traditionally carried a larger supply of land for development than many of our competitors some of the land was purchased during the last few years land prices have fallen in these markets and may continue to fall as new housing demand in our markets has fallen significantly we have elected to sell some of our land and lots at a loss or declined to exercise options even though that required us to forfeit deposits and write off preacquisition costs we also have changed our competitive strategies in some markets and elected to discontinue or postpone development in other markets in response to the downturn as a result we have been required to take substantial writedowns of the carrying value of our land inventory 

capital markets 

recent deterioration in economic conditions and the credit markets could adversely affect our access to capital 

financial and credit markets have been experiencing a period of turmoil that has included the failure or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states government while it is difficult to predict the ultimate results of these events they may impair the company’s ability to borrow money similarly our customers may be unable to borrow money to fund their operations 

continued deteriorating or volatile market conditions could 

 

        ch anges in credit ratings 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results actions that we take their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing the company on a watch list for possible future downgrading downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading could limit our access to the credit markets increase our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

substitution 

some of our products are vulnerable to declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials 

our products may compete with nonfiberbased alternatives or with alternative products in certain market segments for example plastic woodplastic or composite materials may be used by builders as alternatives to the products produced by our wood products businesses such as lumber veneer plywood and oriented strand board changes in prices for oil chemicals and woodbased fiber can change the competitive position of our products relative to available alternatives and could increase substitution of those products for our products as the use of these alternatives grows demand for our products may further decline 

  

   

changes in product mix or pricing 

our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by changes in product mix or pricing 

our results may be affected by a change in our sales mix our outlook assumes a certain volume and product mix of sales if actual results vary from this projected volume and product mix of sales our operations and our results could be negatively affected our outlook also assumes we will be successful in implementing previously announced price increases as well as future price increases delays in acceptance of price increases could negatively affect our results moreover price discounting if required to maintain our competitive position could result in lower than anticipated price realizations 

intense competition 

we face intense competition in our markets and the failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we compete with north american and for many of our product lines global producers some of which may have greater financial resources and lower production costs than we do the principal basis for competition is selling price our ability to maintain satisfactory margins depends in large part on our ability to control our costs our industries are also particularly sensitive to other factors including innovation design quality and service with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line to the extent that one or more of our competitors become more successful with respect to any key competitive factor our ability to attract and retain customers could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to compete effectively such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

material disruption of manufacturing 

a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales or negatively affect our results of operation and financial condition 

any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

 

            any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products andor require us to make unplanned capital expenditures if one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired resulting in lower sales and income 

capital requirements 

our operations require substantial capital 

the company has substantial capital requirements for expansion and repair or replacement of existing facilities or equipment although we maintain our production equipment with regular scheduled maintenance key pieces of equipment may need to be repaired or replaced periodically the costs of repairing or replacing such equipment and the associated downtime of the affected production line could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we believe our capital resources will be adequate to meet our current projected operating needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements if for any reason we are unable to provide for our operating needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements on economic terms we could experience a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

laws and regulations 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with violations of or liabilities under applicable environmental laws and other laws and regulations 

we are subject to a wide range of general and industryspecific laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing 

 

         

   

  in particular the pulp and paper industry in the united states is subject to cluster rules and boiler maximum achievable control technology rules that further regulate effluent and air emissions these laws and regulations will require us to obtain authorizations from and comply with the authorization requirements of the appropriate governmental authorities which have considerable discretion over the terms and timing of permits 

we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations and as a result of remedial obligations we also could incur substantial costs such as civil or criminal fines sanctions and enforcement actions including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions cleanup and closure costs and thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations 

as the owner and operator of real estate including in our homebuilding business we may be liable under environmental laws for cleanup closure and other damages resulting from the presence and release of hazardous substances on or from our properties or operations the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict and in some cases our liability may exceed forecasted amounts or the value of the property itself the discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at our sites or thirdparty sites may result in significant additional costs any material liability we incur could adversely affect our financial condition or preclude us from making capital expenditures that otherwise would benefit our business 

we also anticipate public policy developments at the state federal and international level regarding climate change and energy access security and competitiveness we expect these developments to address emission of carbon dioxide renewable energy and fuel standards and the monetization of carbon compliance with regulations that implement new public policy in these areas might require significant expenditures enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretation of these laws or regulations might require significant expenditures we also anticipate public policy developments at the state federal and international level regarding taxes health care and a number of other areas that could require significant expenditures 

  

currency exchange rates 

we will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates 

we have manufacturing operations in canada uruguay and brazil we are also a large exporter and compete with producers of products very similar to ours therefore we are affected by changes in the strength of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar euro and yen 

availability of raw materials and energy 

our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials and energy 

we rely heavily on certain raw materials principally wood fiber and chemicals and energy sources principally natural gas electricity coal and fuel oil in our manufacturing processes our ability to increase earnings has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials and energy sources we may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material or energy costs through hedging arrangements price increases productivity improvements or costreduction programs 

transportation 

we depend on third parties for transportation services and increases in costs and the availability of transportation could materially adversely affect our business and operations 

our business depends on the transportation of a large number of products both domestically and internationally we rely primarily on third parties for transportation of the products we manufacture andor distribute as well as delivery of our raw materials in particular a significant portion of the goods we manufacture and raw materials we use are transported by railroad or trucks which are highly regulated 

if any of our thirdparty transportation providers were to fail to deliver the goods we manufacture or distribute in a timely manner we may be unable to sell those products at full value — or at all similarly if any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner we may be unable to manufacture our products in response to customer demand in addition if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us we may be unable to replace them at reasonable cost 

any failure of a thirdparty transportation provider to deliver raw materials or finished products in a timely manner could harm our reputation negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation 

in addition an increase in transportation rates or fuel surcharges could materially adversely affect our sales and profitability

legal proceedings 

see note 15 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of legal proceedings 

submission of matters to a vote of security holders 

there were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended december 31 2009 

  

   




 legal proceedings 

we are a party to a number of legal proceedings and adverse judgments in certain legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

the costs and other effects of pending litigation against us and related insurance recoveries cannot be determined with certainty although the disclosure in note 15 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements contains management’s current views of the effect such litigation will have on our financial results there can be no assurance that the outcome of such proceedings will be as expected 

for example there have been several lawsuits filed against us alleging that we violated us antitrust laws those included lawsuits alleging antitrust violations against us and other manufacturers of oriented strand board and lawsuits alleging antitrust violations with respect to alder logs and lumber all of these matters have been settled 

it is possible that there could be adverse judgments against us in some or all major litigation against us and that we could be required to take a charge for all or a portion of any damage award any such charge could materially and adversely affect our results of operations for the quarter or year in which we record it 

export taxes 

we may be required to pay significant export taxes or countervailing and antidumping duties for exported products 

we may experience reduced revenues and margins on some of our businesses as a result of export taxes or countervailing and antidumping duty applications for example in 2001 a group of companies filed petitions with the us department of commerce and the international trade commission claiming that production of softwood lumber in canada was being subsidized by canada and that imports into the us from canada were being sold in us markets at less than their fair value we have softwood lumber facilities in canada that export lumber into the us we paid a total of 370 million in deposits for countervailing duty and antidumping tariffs from 2002 through 2006 related to those lumber exports the us and canadian governments reached a settlement of the dispute in 2006 as a result of the settlement we received a refund of 344 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 however our canadian softwood lumber facilities will have to pay an export tax when the price of lumber is at or below a threshold price the export tax could be as high as 225 percent if a province exceeds its total allotted export share similar types of actions have been initiated from time to time against us and other us producers of products such as paper or lumber by countries such as china and korea it is possible that countervailing duty and antidumping tariffs or similar types of tariffs could be imposed on us in the future we may experience reduced revenues and margins in any business that is subject to such tariffs or to the terms of the settlements of such international disputes these tariffs or settlement terms could have a material adverse effect on our business financial results and financial condition including facility closures or impairments of assets 

election of reit status 

if we elect to be treated as a reit it will have tax and liquidity implications 

as previously announced our board of directors has determined that an election to be treated as a real estate investment trust reit for tax purposes would best support our strategic direction although the timing of the conversion to a reit is uncertain 

as a reit we generally would not be subject to federal or state corporate income taxes on that portion of our capital gain or ordinary income from our reit operations that is distributed to our shareholders our manufacturing operations including our wood products cellulose fibers and real estate businesses would continue to be subject to federal and state corporate income taxes 

election of reit status would require that we make a onetime distribution to our shareholders of our accumulated earnings and profits as calculated for us federal income tax purposes in the form of a special taxable dividend either in cash or a combination of cash and shares of our capital stock or other property we estimate that the aggregate value of the special dividend if declared in 2010 would be approximately 6 billion we would expect to limit the total amount of cash payable in the special dividend to a maximum of 10 percent to 20 percent of the total value of the special dividend or approximately 600 million to 12 billion the balance of the special dividend or approximately 48 to 54 billion would be paid in the form of shares of our capital stock this would require us to issue a significant number of additional shares which will require shareholder approval the actual amount of the special dividend is dependent in part on the results of the company’s operations and may be adjusted by any amount that the board of directors may determine is appropriate to protect the company’s ability to remain qualified as a reit 

natural disasters 

our business and operations could be adversely affected by weather fire infestation or natural disasters 

our timberlands assets may be damaged by adverse weather severe wind and rainstorms fires pest infestation or other natural disasters because our manufacturing processes primarily use wood fiber in many cases from our own 

  

   

timberlands in the event of material damage to our timberlands our operations could be disrupted or our production costs could be increased 

 

 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

 

stockprice volatility 

the price of our common stock may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors some of which are beyond our control including those described above under “risks related to our industries and business” and the following 

 

       in addition there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in the forest products industry that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 

some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them if litigation of this type is brought against us it could result in substantial costs and would divert management’s attention and resources 

  

unresolved staff comments 

there are no unresolved comments that were received from the sec staff relating to our periodic or current reports under the securities exchange act of 1934

 management’s discussion and analysis mda of financial condition and results of operations 

 

 

what you will find in this mda 

 

our mda includes the following major sections 

 

        

 

economic and market conditions affecting our operations 

 

for the last two years we have experienced the effects of the most severe recession since the 1930’s the us housing market experienced a significant downturn in this recession and remains very weak the health of the us housing market strongly affects our real estate wood products and timberlands segments real estate focuses on building single family homes wood products primarily sells into the new residential building and repair and remodel markets demand for logs from our timberlands segment is driven by the production of woodbased building products cellulose fibers is primarily affected by global demand and the value of the us dollar 

housing market 

we track certain indicators such as housing starts home sales employment consumer confidence foreclosures home prices mortgage interest rates and access to mortgages and the number of homes for sale to assess housing market conditions 

nationally employment declined in every month of 2009 in december 2009 the unemployment rate rose to 10 percent from 74 percent in december 2008 unemployment in two states where our real estate segment has operations was higher than the december 2009 national average the december unemployment rate in nevada was 13 percent and in california was 124 percent according to bureau of labor reports 

  

the sustained drop in employment contributed to the consumer confidence index plunging to a record low in the spring of 2009 the consumer confidence index was initiated in 1967 

foreclosure filings during 2009 increased 21 percent compared to 2008 specific markets in which our home builders operate had higher than average foreclosure rates — nevada arizona and california had three of the top four foreclosure rates in the country at 10 percent 6 percent and 475 percent respectively california’s foreclosure activity in total was the highest of the fifty states in 2009 and increased 21 percent from 2008 the national homeowner vacancy rate edged lower to 26 percent yet remained well above the historical average of 16 percent 

new home sales in the us totaled 374000 units in 2009 this was a record low and down 71 percent from the record high of 2005 

us singlefamily housing starts bottomed at an annual rate of 360000 units in first quarter 2009 during the second half the rate of housing starts was 485000 units annually for the year singlefamily starts totaled 443000 units this resulted in an inventory of new homes for sale at the lowest level since 1971 

the housing market conditions described above contributed to a 32 percent decrease in the number of singlefamily homes closed and a 6 percent drop in the average price for homes closed in our real estate operations during 2009 

the depressed level of new home construction and an estimated 15 to 20 percent decrease in repair and remodeling spending resulted in decreased demand for wood products by 40 to 50 percent from the peak of 2006 industry operating rates for lumber and oriented strand board osb averaged between 50 and 60 percent of capacity as a result lumber and osb prices were at or below estimated cash costs during 2009 the price of douglas fir green 2x4s the preferred building product in southern california dropped to 198085 levels in nominal dollar terms demand decreased for both domestic douglas fir logs grown in our western timberlands and lumber produced in our western system 

the price of logs supplied for lumber production fell throughout the first three quarters of 2009 due to lower demand 

us dollarglobal demand 

following the onset of the financial crisis in september 2008 the us dollar strengthened by 15 to 20 percent relative to the canadian dollar and euro the us dollar stayed at these levels through first quarter 2009 since then the dollar has weakened to trading levels that existed prior to the beginning of the financial crisis — 094usc and 147useuro 

  

   

the cellulose fibers business benefitted from the decline in the value of the us dollar as our pulp mills became more competitive compared to european and canadian producers demand for bleached market pulp is estimated to have fallen 09 percent in 2009 while demand decreased in the developed countries demand in china increased 33 percent 

the combination of the weaker dollar steady global demand and decreased capacity resulted in a 35 percent increase in the key indicator pulp price in 2009 this followed a 35 percent drop in the price of market pulp from second quarter 2008 to first quarter 2009 

the weaker dollar against the yen contributed to more stable export log prices despite the sharp decline in wooden housing starts in japan in 2009 the export log market was also helped by higher demand from china in fourth quarter 2009 

  

where we are headed 

the us economy has improved during first quarter 2010 but this improvement appears unlikely to generate meaningful job growth in the quarter existing home sales could decline as there appears to be lower demand for the extended firsttime buyer tax credit the tax credit for current owners is expected to generate few additional home sales as many owners do not have the equity to buy larger homes singlefamily starts are expected to be higher in the quarter given the record low inventory of new homes for sale wood products demand is projected to increase slightly partially as a result of the rebuilding of inventories by dealers and wholesalers the weakness of the us dollar is expected to be favorable for us market pulp producers which is expected to lead to higher pulp prices in us dollar terms

results of operations 

 

in december 2008 the board of directors approved an amendment to our bylaws to adopt a december 31 fiscal yearend effective for fiscal yearend 2008 prior to 2008 our fiscal year ended on the last sunday of the calendar year as a result the number of days in our fiscal year varied for the last three years 

 

   in reviewing our results of operations it is important to understand these terms 

 

  consolidated results 

net sales and revenue and operating income numbers reported in our consolidated results do not include the activity of our discontinued operations 

 

   we report these activities and results as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of earnings however we include the results of these operations in the segment discussions that follow see note 3 discontinued operations in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information about our discontinued operations 

  

how we did in 2009 

summary of financial results 

 

 comparing 2009 with 2008 

in 2009 

 

  net sales and revenues 

net sales and revenues decreased primarily due to the continued market challenges for the us homebuilding industry and weak pulp markets reflected in the following 

      

   

net earnings loss attributable to weyerhaeuser common shareholders 

net loss attributable to weyerhaeuser common shareholders decreased 631 million primarily due to the factors listed below 

reductions to pretax net loss included 

 

        these reductions to net loss during 2009 were partially offset by the following 

 

     

       in addition income tax expense decreased 424 million primarily due to taxes related to the gains from our discontinued operation transactions in 2008 that did not recur in 2009 

comparing 2008 with 2007 

in 2008 

 

   asset impairments and related charges 

we continually monitor our assets for potential impairment particularly in light of market conditions the upheaval in financial markets during fourth quarter 2008 was accompanied by accelerated deterioration of housing markets and a continued decline in demand and pricing for most of our wood products in addition declining demand in emerging asian markets primarily china adversely affected our cellulose fibers operations we recognized significant asset impairments in our real estate segment during the first three quarters of 2008 and the accelerated deterioration of market conditions triggered additional impairments in fourth quarter the continued deterioration of market conditions also led to a fairvalue analysis that indicated the carrying value of the goodwill in our wood products and cellulose fibers segments was impaired in fourth quarter 2008 

our asset impairments and related charges attributable to weyerhaeuser shareholders increased 18 billion — from approximately 330 million in 2007 to approximately 21 billion in 2008 the increase included 

 

  partially offsetting these increased charges is a 24 million decrease in impairments recorded in connection with closures curtailments or sales of operations 

net sales and revenues 

net sales and revenues decreased significantly primarily due to continued deterioration of the us housing market declines in residential homebuilding throughout the nation have resulted in lower demand for residential building products such as 

  

   

softwood lumber oriented strand board osb and engineered lumber sales of products within our wood products segment excluding those of discontinued operations were 19 billion — 34 percent — lower than 2007 these difficult market conditions also affected our real estate segment where net sales and revenues decreased 951 million — 40 percent — from 2007 

net earnings loss attributable to weyerhaeuser common shareholders 

net earnings loss attributable to weyerhaeuser common shareholders decreased 2 billion primarily due to the factors listed below 

reductions to pretax net earnings included 

 

      partially offsetting these reductions to pretax net earnings were 

 

   

    

  

   

    

in addition income tax expense increased 211 million taxes related to gains from discontinued operation transactions increased approximately 1 billion primarily related to the sale of our containerboard packaging and recycling business in 2008 this change was largely offset by tax benefits related to our increased loss from continuing operations as compared with 2007 and a 57 million benefit we recognized related to timber provisions in the food conservation and energy act tree act of 2008 

timberlands 

how we did in 2009 

we report sales volume and annual production data for our timberlands business segment in our businesswhat we dotimberlands  

here is a comparison of net sales and revenues to unaffiliated customers intersegment sales and net contribution to earnings for the last three years 

net sales and revenues and net contribution to earnings for timberlands 

 

   

   

comparing 2009 with 2008 

in 2009 

 

    net sales and revenues — unaffiliated customers 

the 185 million decrease in net sales and revenues to unaffiliated customers resulted from 

 

   these decreases were partially offset by 47 million — 48 percent — increase in log sales in the south as sales volumes increased 51 percent primarily due to sales of fiber logs to international paper for use at locations that previously were owned by weyerhaeuser and higher grade log sales to domestic customers 

intersegment sales 

the 497 million decrease in intersegment sales primarily resulted from 

 

  net contribution to earnings 

the 46 million decrease in net contribution to earnings primarily resulted from 

 

     

these decreases were partially offset by the following 

 

   comparing 2008 with 2007 

in 2008 

 

    net sales and revenues — unaffiliated customers 

the 23 million decrease in net sales and revenues to unaffiliated customers resulted from 

 

    

    

 these decreases were partially offset by 

 

    

   

  

 intersegment sales 

the 312 million decrease in intersegment sales primarily resulted from 

 

    net contribution to earnings 

the 243 million decrease in net contribution to earnings primarily resulted from 

 

    these decreases were partially offset by the following 

 

  our outlook 

excluding the effect of sales of nonstrategic land we expect first quarter operating earnings from the segment to be comparable to fourth quarter primarily due to improved log sales realizations offset by higher costs 

  

wood products 

how we did in 2009 

we report sales volume and annual production data for our wood products business segment in our businesswhat we dowood products 

here is a comparison of net sales and revenues and net contribution to earnings for the last three years 

net sales and revenues and net contribution to earnings for wood products 

 

 comparing 2009 with 2008 

in 2009 

 

  net sales and revenues 

net sales and revenues decreased 15 billion — 41 percent — primarily due to the following 

 

   

   

             net contribution to earnings 

net contribution to earnings improved 814 million primarily due to the following 

 

     these improvements were partially offset by the following 

 

    

comparing 2008 with 2007 

in 2008 

 

   asset impairments 

the accelerated deterioration of market conditions in fourth quarter 2008 adversely affected the results of our wood products operations and led to a fairvalue analysis that indicated the carrying value of the goodwill in our ilevel reporting unit was impaired 

the fairvalue analysis took into account 

 

   based on the results of the fairvalue analysis we recognized a goodwill impairment of 733 million in the wood products segment in the fourth quarter of 2008 total goodwill impairments in 2008 for the segment were 744 million 

during 2008 we also recognized 98 million of other assetimpairment charges in the wood products segment in connection with the expected closure curtailment or sale of operations this compares with total wood products assetimpairment charges of 119 million in 2007 

net sales and revenues 

net sales and revenues decreased 19 billion — 34 percent — primarily due to the following 

 

      

   

  

    net contribution to earnings 

net contribution to earnings decreased 813 million primarily due to the following 

 

  these decreases were partially offset by the following 

 

   in addition net contribution to earnings increased due to reductions in raw material warehousing and delivery costs however these reductions were offset by increased manufacturing costs resulting from reduced operating postures and ongoing costs at curtailed facilities 

our outlook 

we expect a lower operating loss in first quarter due to improved operating rates and anticipated sales realization improvements for lumber and osb

 comparing 2009 with 2008 

in 2009 

  net sales and revenues 

the effects of the global economic recession — weaker pulp demand and a stronger us dollar — resulted in decreased sales realizations from fourth quarter 2008 through first half 2009 pulp prices improved in the second half as the us dollar weakened and demand strengthened the 254 million decrease in net sales and revenues for the full year 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to the following 

 

      

   

net contribution to earnings 

net contribution to earnings increased 297 million primarily due to the following 

 

      these increases were partially offset by the following decreases 

 

    comparing 2008 with 2007 

in 2008 

 

   asset impairments 

the accelerated deterioration of market conditions in fourth quarter 2008 was accompanied by a sudden and dramatic decline in demand for pulp from developing asian markets and a severe downturn in the global pulp market which resulted in a significant decline in pulp prices these developments led to a fairvalue analysis that indicated the carrying value of the goodwill in our cellulose fibers reporting unit was impaired 

the fairvalue analysis takes into account 

 

     

based on the results of the fairvalue analysis we recognized a goodwill impairment of 94 million in the cellulose fibers segment in fourth quarter 2008 

net sales and revenues 

net sales and revenues decreased 4 percent for the year primarily due to a decrease in pulp sales volume which was partially offset by an increase in average price realizations for pulp and liquid packaging board 

for the full year 2008 compared with 2007 

 

    

  net contribution to earnings 

net contribution to earnings decreased 82 million primarily due to the following 

 

      these decreases were partially offset by the following 

 

    

   

 our outlook 

excluding the effect of alternative fuel mixture credits which ended in 2009 we expect earnings from operations for first quarter to be comparable to fourth quarter annual maintenance and fiber costs are expected to increase these costs are expected to offset improved pulp price realizations

   impairments and other related charges attributable to weyerhaeuser shareholders 

we continually monitor our assets for potential impairment particularly in light of the current market conditions additionally we control some land through deposits with land sellers that defer the payment of the full acquisition price until certain entitlements are obtained we also control some land through structured options offered by land sellers 

in 2008 we recorded 874 million in impairments and other related charges attributable to weyerhaeuser shareholders for real estate projects joint ventures and intangible assets this compares with 128 million in impairments and other related charges for real estate projects recorded in 2007 there was a significant increase in impairments from the previous year due to the eroding market conditions for selling new homes and the inability for many home buyers to secure financing due to the changing mortgage market and tighter credit standards in addition during the fourth quarter of 2008 the alreadydepressed housing market was further affected by increased financial turmoil job losses both actual and announced and a loss of consumer confidence reduced the number of potential home buyers increasing foreclosures added inventory to the marketplace causing lower appraisal values and home sale prices 

in light of these deteriorating market conditions and increased uncertainty regarding the timing of recovery the company reviewed its homebuilding projects and land portfolio to determine whether the assets would continue to be held for development or sold during fourth quarter 2008 management decided to sell some of its land portfolio which required the company to write the land assets down to current fair value resulting in impairments impairments also were recorded on projects and land held for development 

  

in addition we recorded 128 million in investment impairments and other related charges attributable to weyerhaeuser shareholders for our real estate investments in 2008 compared with 36 million in 2007 

in 2008 we also wrote off 74 million in costs associated with option deposits and other preacquisition costs related to land parcels that we decided not to acquire in 2007 we wrote off 6 million of option deposits and preacquisition costs

 our outlook 

excluding asset impairments restructuring and related charges we expect the segment to be profitable in first quarter a loss is expected from singlefamily homebuilding operations due to seasonally lower closings however two commercial partnership interests were sold in january 2010 and will contribute 33 million in earnings

stock option exercises 

our cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options were 

 

   we did not recognize any excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options during 2009 or 2008 we recognized 51 million in 2007 due to the high volume of stock options exercised when the price of our common stock reached record highs during the first quarter of that year 

paying dividends and repurchasing stock 

we paid dividends of 

 

   changes in the amount of dividends we paid were primarily due to the decrease in our quarterly dividend from 60 cents to 25 cents in december 2008 and to 5 cents in july 2009

accounting matters 

 

critical accounting policies 

our critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and estimates they also have a high degree of complexity 

in accounting we base our judgments and estimates on 

 

  actual results however may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded 

our most critical accounting policies relate to our 

 

    details about our other significant accounting policies — what we use and how we estimate — are in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  

   

pension and postretirement benefit plans 

we sponsor several pension and postretirement benefit plans for our employees key assumptions we use in accounting for the plans include our 

 

     at the end of every year we review our assumptions with external advisers and make adjustments as appropriate actual experience that differs from our assumptions or any changes in our assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

other factors that affect our accounting for the plans include 

 

     this section provides more information about our 

 

   expected longterm rate of returns 

plan assets are assets of the pension plan trusts that fund the benefits provided under the pension plans the expected longterm rate of return is our estimate of the longterm rate of return that our plan assets will earn after considering all available information at the end of 2009 we continue to assume an expected longterm rate of return of 95 percent factors we considered include 

 

  our expected longterm rate of return is important in determining the net income or expense we recognize for our plans every 05 percent decrease in our expected longterm rate of return would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately 

 

  likewise every 05 percent increase in our expected longterm rate of return would decrease expense or increase a credit by those same amounts 

  

the actual return on plan assets in any given year may vary from our expected longterm rate of return actual returns on plan assets affect the funded status of the plans differences between actual returns on plan assets and the expected long term rate of return are reflected as adjustments to cumulative other comprehensive income loss a component of total equity 

discount rate 

our discount rate as of december 31 2009 is 

 

    we review our discount rates annually and revise them as needed the discount rates are selected at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of highquality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits 

pension and postretirement benefit expenses for 2010 will be based on the 59 and 52 percent assumed discount rates for us plans and the 61 percent and 60 percent assumed discount rates for the canadian plans 

our discount rate is important in determining the cost of our plans a 05 percent decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately 

 

  contributions made and benefits paid 

during 2009 

 

      

   

during 2010 

we intend to make a voluntary contribution of approximately 100 million to the us qualified pension plans for the 2009 plan year the contribution will be made prior to september 15 2010 the contribution will decrease 2009 taxable income thereby increasing the amount of the 2009 net operating loss refund it would also decrease the earnings and profits required for a real estate investment trust conversion this contribution is expected to eliminate the estimated 30 million minimum funding requirements for this plan for 2010 which would have been due by september 15 2011 

in addition 

 

   receivable from pension trust 

during 2009 and 2008 there was a high volume of lumpsum distributions from our us qualified pension plans retirementeligible employees whose employment with the company terminated in connection with the sale of our containerboard packaging and recycling business or corporate restructuring activities could elect to receive their pension benefit as a lumpsum distribution if permitted in accordance with the plans’ provisions in addition market events during the same period adversely affected liquidity for instance many of the funds in which plan assets are invested changed their redemption terms which delayed some of the pension trusts’ cash receipts to avoid liquidating assets at depressed prices and as permitted by law we elected to provide 285 million of shortterm liquidity to the us pension trust through shortterm loans these shortterm loans were made in fourth quarter 2008 and first quarter 2009 markets and liquidity improved in 2009 and the pension trust repaid 139 million in fourth quarter 2009 full repayment of the remaining balance is anticipated in 2010 

longlived assets 

we review the carrying value of our longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations the carrying value is the amount assigned to longlived assets in our books 

  

an impairment occurs when the carrying value of longlived assets will not be recovered from future cash flows and is less than fair market value fair market value is the estimated amount we would get if we were to sell the assets 

in determining fair market value and whether impairment has occurred we are required to estimate 

 

   key assumptions we use in developing the estimates include 

 

     impairment of longlived assets real estate 

ordinarily we review homebuilding longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable we recorded longlived homebuilding asset impairments and related charges attributable to weyerhaeuser shareholders of 261 million in 2009 11 billion in 2008 and 170 million in 2007 

real estate held for development 

real estate held for development includes subdivisions and master planned communities mpcs mpcs typically include several product segments such as residential active adult retail and commercial we evaluate impairment at the subdivision or mpc product segment level factors that are considered when evaluating a subdivision or mpc product segment for impairment include 

 

    we update the undiscounted cash flow forecast for each subdivision and mpc product segment that may be impaired the undiscounted cash flow forecasts are affected by communityspecific factors that include 

 

    

   

    the carrying amount of each subdivision and mpc product segment is written down to fair value when the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of a subdivision or mpc product segment an impairment charge for a subdivision or mpc product segment is allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot 

real estate held for sale 

real estate held for sale includes homes that have been completed and land that we intend to sell we regularly sell land or lots that do not fit our value proposition or development plans 

the carrying amount of real estate held for sale is reduced to fair value less estimated costs to sell if the forecasted net proceeds are less than the carrying amount the fair value analysis is affected by local market economic conditions demographic factors and competitor actions and is inherently uncertain actual net proceeds can differ from the estimates the carrying amount of real estate held for sale is evaluated quarterly 

market approach 

we use the market approach to determine fair value of real estate held for development and held for sale when information for comparable assets is available this approach is commonly used for our active projects where we are selling product we typically use 

 

    income approach 

we generally use the income approach to determine fair value of real estate for our inactive projects the income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example cash flows or earnings to a single present amount discounted the fair value measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations regarding those future estimated cash inflows and outflows we use present value techniques based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams discount rates applied to the estimated future cash flows of our homebuilding assets in yeartodate 2009 ranged from 12 percent to 25 percent the income approach relies on management judgment regarding the various inputs to the undiscounted cash flow forecasts 

legal environmental and product liability reserves 

we record contingent liabilities when 

 

  legal matters 

determining our liabilities for legal matters requires projections about the outcome of litigation and the amount of our financial responsibility we base our projections on 

 

  while we do our best in developing our projections litigation is still inherently unpredictable details about our legal exposures and proceedings are discussed in note 15 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  these exposures and proceedings are significant ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flow in any given quarter or year 

environmental matters 

determining our liabilities for environmental matters requires estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs we base our estimates on 

 

    product liability matters 

we record reserves for contingent productliability matters when it becomes probable we will make financial payment determining the amount of reserves we record requires projections of future claim rates and amounts 

  

   

depletion 

we record depletion — the costs attributed to timber harvested — as trees are harvested 

to calculate our depletion rate which is updated annually we 

 

  estimating the volume of timber available for harvest over the harvest cycle requires the consideration of the following factors 

 

         

in addition the length of the harvest cycle varies by geographic region and species of timber 

depletionrate calculations do not include estimates for

longterm debt obligations 

 

the following summary of our longterm debt obligations includes 

 

   we estimate the fair value of longterm debt based on quoted market prices we received for the same types and issues of our debt or on the discounted value of the future cash flows using market yields for the same type and comparable issues of debt changes in market rates of interest affect the fair value of our fixedrate debt 

summary of longterm debt obligations as of december 31 2009 

 

  

 

our use of derivatives 

 

we occasionally use derivatives to 

 

   the fair value of our derivatives may vary due to the volatility of the underlying forward prices or index rates associated with them 

  

commodity futures swaps and collars 

as of december 31 2009 we had no material commodity swap contracts outstanding

what we do 

 

this section provides information about how we 

 

   for each of our business segments we provide details about what we do where we do it how much we sell and where we are headed 

timberlands 

our timberlands business segment manages 67 million acres of private commercial forestland worldwide we own 6 million of those acres and lease the other 700000 acres in addition we have renewable longterm licenses on 152 million acres of forestland located in four canadian provinces the tables presented in this section include data from this segment’s business units as of the end of 2008 

due to changes in senior management responsibility during 2008 we now report our international operations outside of north america – which consist primarily of timberlands and related converting operations in south america – as part of our timberlands business segment we previously reported these operations as part of our corporate and other business segment we have reclassified business segment results for prior periods to be consistent with the current presentation 

what we do 

forestry management 

our timberlands business segment is recognized as a leading forest manager we 

 

     our goal is to achieve maximum returns by selling logs and stumpage to internal and external customers we focus on solid wood and use intensive silviculture to improve forest productivity and returns while managing the forests on a sustainable basis to meet both customer and public expectations 

wholly owned subsidiaries or joint ventures – for which we are the managing partner – run our international operations in this business segment our international assets consist principally of forest plantations forest licenses and converting assets in south america weyerhaeuser is also the managing partner in fujian yong hui forestry co ltd a joint venture in china established in 2007 the joint venture is owned 51 percent by weyerhaeuser and 49 percent by fujian yong’an forestry company as of december 31 2008 the joint venture managed 2233 acres of timberlands with 56000 seedlings planted in 2008 

sustainable forestry practices 

we are committed to responsible environmental stewardship wherever we operate managing forests not only for wood production but also for the ecosystem services they provide most of the forests we manage include places with unique environmental cultural historical or recreational value we manage these areas under regulatory requirements and voluntary standards to protect their unique qualities protecting forests with exceptional conservation value is part of implementing the sustainable forestry initiative ® sfi standard all of the forests we own or manage in the united states have been independently certified as meeting the sfi standard in addition our forestlands in uruguay are the model for the developing uruguayan national forest certification standard designed to be endorsed by the program for the endorsement of forest certification pefc 

canadian forestry operations 

in canada we are licensed to operate forestlands that provide the volume for our manufacturing units in various provinces when the volume is harvested we pay the provinces at stumpage rates that are set by the government and generally based on prevailing market prices the economic benefit of growing the timber accrues to the provincial government we do not generate any profit in the timberlands segment from the harvest of timber from the licensed acres in canada 

  

   

other values from our timberlands 

we use our geologic databases to identify and market opportunities for commercial mineral and geothermal development on our lands with a focus on the pacific northwest and southern united states revenue is primarily derived from 

 

   timberlands products 

 

 how we measure our product 

beginning this year we have started to report timberlands data in cubic meters cubic meters is a measure of the total volume of wood fiber in a tree or log that can be sold cubic meter volume is determined from the large and smallend diameters and length and provides a more consistent and comparative measure of timber and log volume among operating regions species size and seasons of the year than other units of measure 

previously we recorded the measurable amount of fiber we can sell from a log in cunits a similar volumetric measure where 1 cunit equals 100 cubic feet of solid wood we changed the measurement because cubic meters is an internationally recognized measure of solid wood volume one cunit is equal to 283 cubic meters 

we also use two other units of measure when transacting business including 

 

    

both of these measures are accurate for the regional purposes for which they are used but they do not provide a meaningful basis for volumetric comparisons or comparisons between the regions 

the conversion rate for mbf to cubic meters varies based on several factors including diameter length and taper of the timber being measured the average conversion rate for mbf to cubic meters is approximately 67 cubic meters per mbf 

the conversion rate from green tons to cubic meters also varies based on the season harvested and the specific gravity of the wood for the region from which the timber is produced an average conversion rate for green tons to cubic meters is approximately 0825 cubic meters per green ton 

where we do it 

our balanced portfolio of timberlands assets are located primarily in north america in the us we own and manage sustainable forests – for use in wood products and pulp and paper manufacturing – in nine states we own or lease 

 

  our international operations are located primarily in uruguay and china where as of december 31 2008 we own a total of 321000 acres and have longterm leases on another 28000 acres 

in addition we have renewable longterm licenses on 152 million acres of forestland that is owned by the provincial government of four canadian provinces 

our total timber inventory—including timber on owned and leased land in our us and international operations—is approximately 319 million cubic meters the timber inventory on licensed lands in canada is approximately 382 million cubic meters the amount of timber inventory does not translate into an amount of lumber or panel products because the quantity of end products 

 

  the relative value of our timberlands is affected by the species size and grade of the trees 

  

   

summary of 2008 timber inventory and timberland locations 

united states 

 

 our western timberlands are composed primarily of douglas fir a species highly valued for its structural strength we also have large volumes of western hemlock along the coastal areas to serve the whitewood markets our southern timberlands are predominantly southern yellow pine which provide grade logs to wood products facilities and chips and fiber logs to pulp and paper operations both regions have minor volumes of various hardwood species 

international 

 

 our forestlands in uruguay are composed of approximately 70 percent loblolly pine and 30 percent eucalyptus the average age class of the timber in uruguay is in the first third of its rotation age it is entering into that part of the growth rotation when we will see increased volume accretion only 50 percent of the area to be planted has been afforested to date the afforestation program is planned to be completed within the next four years 

  

canada – licensed timberlands 

 

 we lease and license forestland in canada to secure the volume for our manufacturing units in the various provinces we transfer logs from our harvest operations to our manufacturing facilities at cost any profit from the conversion of these logs is recognized in the wood products or cellulose fibers operating segment responsible for that activity 

all licenses managed in canada have been independently certified using the canadian standards association csa standard 

fiveyear summary of timberlands production 

 

 our timberlands annual fee depletion represents the harvest of the timber assets we own depletion is a method of expensing the cost of establishing the fee timber asset base over the harvest or timber sales volume the decline in fee depletion from 2004 through 2006 reflects the disposition of our bc coastal operations in may 2005 the increase in volume in the west in 2008 reflects increased volume from salvage efforts following a december 2007 windstorm

log sales volumes 

logs sold to unaffiliated customers in 2008 increased approximately 15 million cubic meters – 17 percent – from 2007 

 

    we have three primary grades of log sales – domestic grade domestic fiber and export factors that may affect log sales in each of these categories include 

 

     

   

all our domestic and export logs are sold to unaffiliated customers or transferred at market prices to our internal mills by the sales and marketing staff within our timberlands business units 

fiveyear summary of log sales volumes to unaffiliated customers for timberlands 

 

 log prices 

the majority of our log sales to unaffiliated customers are sales to the export market and to other domestic sawmills in the pacific northwest following is a fiveyear summary of selected export log prices 

fiveyear summary of selected export log prices 

2 sawlog bark on – mbf 

  

our log prices are affected by the supply of and demand for grade and fiber logs and are influenced by the same factors that affect log sales export log prices are particularly affected by the japanese housing market 

average 2008 log realizations in the west decreased from 2007 – primarily due to lower domestic log prices and an increased mix of lowervalue whitewood in both our export and domestic volumes resulting from the salvage logging efforts following the december 2007 windstorm these were slightly offset by increased log realizations in the south compared to 2007 

where we’re headed 

our competitive strategies include 

 

       in addition we believe we will generate additional revenues from new products and services such as wetland mitigation banking and conservation easements and from participating in emerging carbon markets

the volume of wood products sold in 2008 declined from 2007 primarily due to a significant decline in market demand resulting from the downturn of the homebuilding and repair and remodel markets in response to these market conditions in 2007 and 2008 we sold or closed a number of facilities and curtailed production at several other mills the sales and closures include

 wood products prices 

prices for wood products in 2008 declined from 2007 

in general the following factors influence prices for wood products 

 

   demand for home construction fell dramatically from 2006 through 2008 with a corresponding drop in demand for the products that we produce and sell the ongoing oversupply of products has put significant and prolonged downward pressure on prices this is evident in the following graphs

pulp volumes 

our sales volume of cellulose fiber products in 2008 was 17 million tons – a decrease of 18 percent compared with 2007 this reduction in volume was primarily due to the divestiture of five production facilities in the 2007 domtar transaction following the divestiture we entered into a brokerage agreement with domtar under which we bought and resold pulp for the remainder of 2007 this activity did not continue in 2008 – further reducing our sales volumes

 where we do it 

our operations are concentrated in select metropolitan areas 

    how much we sell 

we are one of the top 20 homebuilding companies in the us as measured by annual singlefamily home closings 

our revenues decreased to 14 billion in 2008 – 40 percent – from 24 billion in 2007 primarily due to a 28 percent decline in singlefamily closings the decline in home closings is the result of weak financial markets tight lending standards and the collapse of consumer confidence which continues to put downward pressure on pricing

corporate and other 

what we do 

our corporate and other segment includes 

 

   we also record certain gains or charges in the corporate and other segment related to dispositions or events that generally are not related to an individual operating segment 

the following changes were made to the corporate and other segment during 2008 

international operations 

ongoing operations outside of north america which previously were reported as part of the corporate and other segment are reported as part of the timberlands segment segment results for prior periods have been recast to present information consistent with the current presentation 

pension and postretirement credits costs 

allocation of credits costs to the forest products operating segments ceased as of the beginning of 2008 for pension and as of the beginning of the third quarter for postretirement prior periods were not recast to reflect the change in allocation methodology except as listed below pension and postretirement credits costs are now held in the corporate and other segment 

 

  where we do it 

our transportation operations include our marine operations which provide shipping between north america and asia and our railroad operations which are located in the western and southern us 

as part of our strategic restructuring of our international holdings we

how much we sell 

sales and revenues for our corporate and other segment are primarily related to our marine transportation and discontinued international operations in 2008 our net sales were 392 million compared with 432 million in 2007 the decline in revenues is primarily due to the sale of the australian operations in july 2008

natural resource and environmental matters 

 

many social values are expressed in the laws and regulations that pertain to growing and harvesting timber we participate in voluntary certification of our timberlands to assure that we sustain their values including the protection of wildlife and water changes in law and regulation can significantly affect local or regional timber harvest levels and market values of timberbased raw materials 

endangered species protections 

in the us a number of fish and wildlife species that inhabit geographic areas near or within our timberlands have been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal endangered species act esa or similar state laws some of these listed species include the northern spotted owl the marbled murrelet a number of salmon species bull trout and steelhead trout in the pacific northwest and the redcockaded woodpecker gopher tortoise and american burying beetle in the southeast additional species or populations may be listed as threatened or endangered as a result of pending or future citizen petitions or petitions initiated by federal or state agencies 

federal and state requirements to protect habitat for threatened and endangered species have resulted in restrictions on timber harvest on some timberlands including some of our timberlands additional listings of fish and wildlife species as endangered threatened or sensitive under the esa or similar state laws as well as regulatory actions taken by federal or state agencies to protect habitat for these species may in the future result in additional restrictions on our timber harvests and other forest management practices they also could increase our operating costs and affect timber supply and prices in general 

in canada the federal species at risk act sara was enacted in 2002 sara enacted protective measures for species identified as being at risk and for critical habitat to date sara has not had a significant effect on our operations however it is anticipated that sara will over time result in some additional restrictions on timber harvests and other forest management practices and increase some operating costs for operators of forestlands in canada for these reasons sara is expected to affect timber supply and prices in the future 

regulations affecting forestry practices 

in the us regulations established by federal state and local governments or agencies to protect water quality and wetlands could affect future harvests and forest management practices on some of our timberlands forest practice acts in some states in the us increasingly affect present or future harvest and forest management activities for example in some states these acts limit the size of clearcuts require some timber to be left unharvested to protect water quality and fish and wildlife habitat regulate construction and maintenance of forest roads require reforestation following timber harvest and contain procedures for state agencies to review and approve proposed forest practice activities some states and local governments regulate certain forest practices through various permit programs each state in which we own timberlands has developed best management practices to reduce the effects of forest practices on water quality and aquatic habitats additional and more stringent regulations may be adopted by various state and local governments to achieve waterquality standards under the federal clean water act protect fish and wildlife habitats or achieve other public policy objectives 

our forest operations in canada are carried out on public forestlands under forest licenses all forest operations are subject to forest practices and environmental regulations and operations under licenses also are subject to contractual requirements between us and the relevant province designed to protect environmental and other social values 

forest certification standards 

we operate in the us under the sustainable forestry initiative ®  this is a certification standard designed to supplement government regulatory programs with voluntary landowner initiatives to further protect certain public resources and values the sustainable forestry initiative ® is an independent standard overseen by a governing board consisting of conservation organizations academia the forest industry and large and small forest landowners compliance with the sustainable forestry initiative ® may result in some increases in our operating costs and curtailment of our timber harvests in some areas in canada we participate in the canadian standards association sustainable forest management system standard a voluntary certification system that further protects certain public resources and values compliance with this standard will result in some increases in our operating costs and curtailment of our timber harvests in some areas in canada 

what these regulations and certification programs mean to us 

the regulatory and nonregulatory forest management programs described above have increased our operating costs resulted in changes in the value of timber and logs from our timberlands and contributed to increases in the prices paid for wood products and wood chips during periods of high demand these kinds of programs also can make it more difficult for us to respond to rapid changes in markets extreme weather or other unexpected circumstances one additional effect may be further reductions in the usage of or substitution of other products for 

  

   

lumber and plywood we believe that these kinds of programs have not had and in 2009 will not have a significant effect on the total harvest of timber in the us or canada however these kinds of programs may have such an effect in the future we expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these programs as compared with typical owners of comparable timberlands we also expect that these programs will not significantly disrupt our planned operations over large areas or for extended periods 

canadian aboriginal rights 

many of the canadian forestlands also are subject to the constitutionally protected treaty or commonlaw rights of the aboriginal peoples of canada most of british columbia bc is not covered by treaties and as a result the claims of bc’s aboriginal peoples relating to forest resources are largely unresolved although many aboriginal groups are actively engaged in treaty discussions with the governments of bc and canada final or interim resolution of claims brought by aboriginal groups is expected to result in additional restrictions on the sale or harvest of timber and may increase operating costs and affect timber supply and prices in canada we believe that such claims will not have a significant effect on our total harvest of timber or production of forest products in 2009 although they may have such an effect in the future in 2008 the forest products association of canada fpac of which we are a member signed a memorandum of understanding with the assembly of first nations under which the parties agree to work together to strengthen canada’s forest sector through economicdevelopment initiatives and business investments strong environmental stewardship and the creation of skilldevelopment opportunities particularly targeted to aboriginal youth 

pollutioncontrol regulations 

our operations also are subject to federal state provincial and local pollution controls with regard to air water and land solid and hazardous waste management and disposal and remediation laws and regulations in all areas in which we have operations we also are subject to market demands with respect to chemical content of some of our products compliance with these laws regulations and demands usually involves capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs we cannot easily quantify the future amounts of capital expenditures we might have to make to comply with these laws regulations and demands or the effects on our operating costs because in some instances compliance standards have not been developed or have not become final or definitive in addition when we make changes in operations to comply with regulatory standards we frequently are making changes for other purposes as well these purposes might include the extension of facility life an increase in capacity changes in raw material requirements or an increase in the economic value of assets or products 

it is difficult to isolate the environmental component of most manufacturing capital projects but we estimate that our capital expenditures for environmental compliance were approximately 16 million in 2008 approximately 4 percent of total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and real estate based on our understanding of current regulatory requirements in the us and canada we expect that capital expenditures for environmental compliance will be approximately 5 million in 2009 approximately 2 percent of expected total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and real estate 

environmental cleanup 

we are involved in the environmental investigation or remediation of numerous sites we presently own or formerly owned of these sites we may have the sole obligation to remediate or may share that obligation with one or more parties in some instances several parties have joint and several obligations to remediate some sites are superfund sites where we have been named as a potentially responsible party our liability with respect to these various sites ranges from insignificant to substantial the amount of liability depends on the quantity toxicity and nature of materials at the site and depends on the number and economic viability of the other responsible parties 

we spent approximately 9 million in 2008 and expect to spend approximately 7 million in 2009 on environmental remediation of these sites it is our policy to accrue for environmentalremediation costs when we determine it is probable that such an obligation exists and can reasonably estimate the amount of the obligation we currently believe it is reasonably possible that our costs to remediate all the identified sites may exceed our current accruals of 37 million the excess amounts required may be insignificant or could range in the aggregate up to approximately 36 million over several years this estimate of the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs is much less certain than the estimates we currently are using to determine how much to accrue the estimate of the upper range also uses assumptions less favorable to us among the range of reasonably possible outcomes 

regulation of air emissions in the us 

the united states environmental protection agency epa has promulgated regulations for air emissions from pulp and paper manufacturing facilities wood products facilities and industrial boilers these regulations cover hazardous air pollutants that require use of maximum achievable control technology mact and controls for pollutants that contribute to smog and haze in recent dc circuit court decisions the mact standards for air 

  

   

emissions from industrial boilers and process heaters were vacated and the standards for plywood and composite wood products were remanded to the epa the epa must promulgate supplemental mact standards for plywood and composite products and new mact standards for boilers pending final action by the epa some states may implement mact requirements for boilers on a casebycase basis we anticipate that we might spend as much as 30 million to 100 million over the next few years to comply with the mact standards after they have been determined by the epa and the states we cannot currently quantify the amount of capital we will need in the future to comply with new regulations being developed by the epa or canadian environmental agencies because final rules have not been promulgated however at this time we anticipate that compliance with the new regulations will not result in capital expenditures in any year that is material in relation to our annual capital expenditures 

in 2006 we adopted a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2020 compared with our emissions in 2000 assuming a comparable portfolio and regulations we intend to achieve this goal by increasing energy efficiency and using more greenhouse gasneutral biomass fuels instead of fossil fuels during 2007 we divested our fine paper operations and related assets and during 2008 we completed the sale of our containerboard packaging and recycling business these transactions removed several high greenhouse gasemitting operations from our manufacturing portfolio in accord with generally accepted voluntary greenhouse gas accounting standards we will adjust our baseline year 2000 values and subsequent year greenhouse gas inventory values to reflect these changes 

in 2007 the us supreme court ruled that greenhouse gases are pollutants that can be subject to regulation under the clean air act as a result of this ruling the epa may regulate greenhouse gas emissions some state governments also have released policy proposals that indicate they may regulate greenhouse gas emissions in the future in addition we anticipate congress will consider and adopt new legislation regulating greenhouse gas emissions within the next few years it is not yet known when and to what extent these federal and state policy activities may come into force or how any future federal and state greenhouse gas regulatory programs may relate to each other a multistate and federal greenhouse gas emissions reduction trading system may be put in place in the future with potentially significant implications for all us businesses we believe these measures have not had and in 2009 will not have a significant effect on weyerhaeuser’s operations although they may have such an effect in the future we expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with typical owners of comparable operations we also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations 

regulation of air emissions in canada 

we actively participate in negotiations between the fpac and natural resources canada to define industry obligations for complying with canada’s national plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions over the next several years fpac continues to work with international national and regional policy makers in their efforts to develop technically sound and economically viable policies practices and procedures for measuring reporting and managing greenhouse gas emissions 

in 2007 the canadian federal government proposed a regulatory framework for air emissions that adopts some aspects of the kyoto protocol the federal framework calls for mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for heavy industrial emissions producers among other measures to be put in place by 2010 canadian provincial governments also are working on emissionsreduction strategies for example the province of alberta has adopted rules requiring mandatory reporting and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by large emitters one of the company’s pulp mills is subject to these rules but we believe the mill will be able to comply with the rules as a result of productivity and energy systems currently in place it is not yet known what final requirements will come into force or how any provincial and federal plans that may be put into place will relate to each other a canadian emissions trading system may be put in place in the future with potentially significant implications for canadian businesses we believe these measures have not had and in 2009 will not have a significant effect on weyerhaeuser’s operations although they may have such an effect in the future we expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with typical owners of comparable operations we also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations 

potential changes in pollution regulation 

the epa has repealed the regulations promulgated in 2000 that would have required states to develop total maximum daily load tmdl allocations for pollutants in water bodies determined to be waterqualityimpaired however states continue to promulgate tmdl requirements state tmdl requirements may set limits on pollutants that may be discharged to a body of water or set additional requirements such as best management practices for nonpoint sources including timberland operations to reduce the amounts of pollutants it is not possible to estimate the capital expenditures that may be required for us to meet pollution allocations across the various proposed state tmdl programs until a specific tmdl is promulgated

 risk factors 

we are subject to certain risks and events that if one or more of them occur could adversely affect our business our financial condition our results of operations and the trading price of our common stock 

you should consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information presented in this report and the matters described in “forwardlooking statements” as well as the other reports and registration statements we file from time to time with the sec in evaluating us our business and an investment in our securities 

the risks below are not the only risks we face additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely affect our business 

 

 

risks related to our industries and business 

 

macroeconomic conditions 

the industries in which we operate are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions and consequently highly cyclical 

the overall levels of demand for the products we manufacture and distribute and consequently our sales and profitability reflect fluctuations in levels of enduser demand which depend in part on general macroeconomic conditions in north america and worldwide as well as on local economic conditions the current significant recession in the united states and the global economic downturn combined with the dislocation in the financial markets and decreased availability of credit has resulted in a significant downturn for the homebuilding industry including the company’s real estate businesses increased inventories of available new homes significant declines in home prices loss of homeequity values and loss of consumer confidence and demand our wood products segment is highly dependent on the strength of the homebuilding industry and the downturn in that industry has resulted in significant decreases in the prices of and demand for wood products and building materials this has been further reflected in declining prices and demand for logs and reduced harvests in our timberland segment the global economic downturn also has adversely affected demand for consumer products generally including products containing pulp resulting in significant decreases in the price of pulp the length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time and by product but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions consumer demand could continue to decline as a result of the current economic conditions further adversely affecting our businesses 

  

commodity products 

many of our products are commodities that are widely available from other producers 

because commodity products have few distinguishing properties from producer to producer competition for these products is based primarily on price which is determined by supply relative to demand and competition from substitute products prices for our products are affected by many factors outside of our control and we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes which often are volatile our profitability with respect to these products depends in part on managing our costs particularly raw material and energy costs which represent significant components of our operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control prices of and demand for many of our products have declined significantly in recent quarters while many of our raw material or energy costs have increased this has adversely affected both our sales and profitability 

industry supply of logs wood products and pulp 

excess supply of products may adversely affect prices and margins 

industry supply of logs wood products and pulp is subject to changing macroeconomic and industry conditions that may cause producers to idle or permanently close individual machines or entire mills or to decrease harvest levels to avoid substantial cash costs in connection with idling or closing a mill some producers choose to continue to operate at a loss which could prolong weak prices due to oversupply oversupply of products also may result from producers introducing new capacity or increasing harvest levels in response to favorable shortterm pricing trends industry supplies of pulp also are influenced by overseas production capacity which has grown in recent years and is expected to continue to grow while the weakness of the us dollar in recent years has improved the company’s competitive position and mitigated the levels of imports the recent strengthening of the us dollar and decreases in demand for consumer products in emerging markets may result in increased imports of pulp from overseas 

resulting in lower prices continuation of these factors could materially and adversely affect sales volumes and margins of our operations 

  

   

homebuilding market and economic risks 

the homebuilding industry is in the midst of a significant downturn and a continuing decline in demand coupled with an increase in the inventory of available homes could continue to adversely affect our sales volume pricing and margins and result in further impairments 

demand for homes is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as the level of employment consumer confidence consumer income the availability of financing and interest rate levels during 2007 and 2008 the mortgage industry experienced significant instability and increasing default rates particularly with regard to subprime and other nonconforming loans causing many lenders to tighten credit requirements and reduce the number of mortgage loans available for financing home purchases the turmoil in the financial and credit markets increased significantly during the fourth quarter of 2008 including the failure or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the u s government the significant increase in unemployment during 2008 coupled with accelerating foreclosure rates and distress sales of houses increasing inventories of unsold homes significant declines in home values and a collapse of consumer confidence has resulted in significant declines in demand for new homes and increasing cancellation rates in all of our markets as homebuyers sometimes find it more advantageous to forfeit a deposit than to complete the purchase of the home these factors have resulted in reduced margins and prices and a higher level of sales incentives in many of our markets 

the company has traditionally carried a larger supply of land for development than many of our competitors some of the land was purchased during the last few years land prices have fallen in these markets and may continue to fall we also hold options to purchase land at prices that no longer are attractive or in areas that may not be attractive for development in the near future as new housing demand in our markets has fallen significantly we have elected to sell some of our land and lots at a loss or declined to exercise high price options even though that required us to forfeit deposits and write off preacquisition landdevelopment costs we also have changed our competitive strategies in some markets and elected to discontinue or postpone development in other markets in response to the downturn as a result we have been required to take substantial writedowns of the carrying value of our land inventory 

capital markets 

recent deterioration in economic conditions and the credit markets could adversely affect our access to capital 

financial and credit markets have been experiencing a period of turmoil that has included the failure or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states government while it is difficult to predict the ultimate results of these events they may impair the company’s ability to borrow money similarly our customers may be unable to borrow money to fund their operations 

continued deteriorating or volatile market conditions could 

 

        changes in credit ratings 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized sta tistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results actions that we take their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing the company on a watch list for possible future downgrading downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading could limit our access to the credit markets increase our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

substitution 

some of our products are vulnerable to declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials 

our products may compete with nonfiberbased alternatives or with alternative products in certain market segments for example plastic woodplastic or composite materials may be used by builders as alternatives to the products produced by our wood products businesses such as lumber veneer plywood and oriented strand board changes in prices for oil 

  

   

chemicals and woodbased fiber can change the competitive position of our products relative to available alternatives and could increase substitution of those products for our products as the use of these alternatives grows demand for our products may further decline 

changes in product mix or pricing 

our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by changes in product mix or pricing 

our results may be affected by a change in our sales mix our outlook assumes a certain volume and product mix of sales if actual results vary from this projected volume and product mix of sales our operations and our results could be negatively affected our outlook also assumes we will be successful in implementing previously announced price increases as well as future price increases delays in acceptance of price increases could negatively affect our results moreover price discounting if required to maintain our competitive position could result in lower than anticipated price realizations 

intense competition 

we face intense competition in our markets and the failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we compete with north american and for many of our product lines global producers some of which may have greater financial resources and lower production costs than we do the principal basis for competition is selling price our ability to maintain satisfactory margins depends in large part on our ability to control our costs our industries are also particularly sensitive to other factors including innovation design quality and service with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line to the extent that one or more of our competitors become more successful with respect to any key competitive factor our ability to attract and retain customers could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to compete effectively such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

material disruption of manufacturing 

a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales or negatively affect our results of operation and financial condition 

any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

 

            any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products andor require us to make unplanned capital expenditures if one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired resulting in lower sales and income 

capital requirements 

our operations require substantial capital 

the company has substantial capital requirements for expansion and repair or replacement of existing facilities or equipment although we maintain our production equipment with regular scheduled maintenance key pieces of equipment may need to be repaired or replaced periodically the costs of repairing or replacing such equipment and the associated downtime of the affected production line could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we believe our capital resources will be adequate to meet our current projected operating needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements if for any reason we are unable to provide for our operating needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements on economic terms we could experience a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

environmental laws and regulations 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with violations of or liabilities under applicable environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to a wide range of general and industryspecific laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing 

 

      

   

     in particular the pulp and paper industry in the us is subject to cluster rules and boiler maximum achievable control technology rules that further regulate effluent and air emissions these laws and regulations will require us to obtain authorizations from and comply with the authorization requirements of the appropriate governmental authorities which have considerable discretion over the terms and timing of permits 

we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations and as a result of remedial obligations we also could incur substantial costs such as civil or criminal fines sanctions and enforcement actions including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions cleanup and closure costs and thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations 

as the owner and operator of real estate including in our homebuilding business we may be liable under environmental laws for cleanup closure and other damages resulting from the presence and release of hazardous substances on or from our properties or operations the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict and in some cases our liability may exceed forecasted amounts or the value of the property itself the discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at our sites or thirdparty sites may result in significant additional costs any material liability we incur could adversely affect our financial condition or preclude us from making capital expenditures that otherwise would benefit our business 

we also anticipate public policy developments at the state federal and international level regarding climate change and energy access security and competitiveness we expect these developments to address emission of carbon dioxide renewable energy and fuel standards and the monetization of carbon compliance with regulations that implement new public policy in these areas might require significant expenditures enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretation of these laws or regulations might require significant expenditures 

  

currency exchange rates 

we will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates 

we have manufacturing operations in canada uruguay and brazil and we are also a large exporter and as a result are affected by changes in currency exchange rates particularly the value of the us dollar relative to the euro and the canadian dollar 

availability of raw materials and energy 

our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials and energy 

we rely heavily on certain raw materials principally wood fiber and chemicals and energy sources principally natural gas electricity coal and fuel oil in our manufacturing processes our ability to increase earnings has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials and energy sources we may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material or energy costs through hedging arrangements price increases productivity improvements or costreduction programs 

transportation 

we depend on third parties for transportation services and increases in costs and the availability of transportation could materially adversely affect our business and operations 

our business depends on the transportation of a large number of products both domestically and internationally we rely primarily on third parties for transportation of the products we manufacture andor distribute as well as delivery of our raw materials in particular a significant portion of the goods we manufacture and raw materials we use are transported by railroad or trucks which are highly regulated 

if any of our thirdparty transportation providers were to fail to deliver the goods we manufacture or distribute in a timely manner we may be unable to sell those products at full value – or at all similarly if any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner we may be unable to manufacture our products in response to customer demand in addition if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us we may be unable to replace them at reasonable cost 

any failure of a thirdparty transportation provider to deliver raw materials or finished products in a timely manner could harm our reputation negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation 

  

   

in addition an increase in transportation rates or fuel surcharges could materially adversely affect our sales and profitability

legal proceedings

submission of matters to a vote of security holders 

there were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended december 31 2008 

  

   




 legal proceedings 

we are a party to a number of legal proceedings and adverse judgments in certain legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

the costs and other effects of pending litigation against us and related insurance recoveries cannot be determined with certainty although the disclosure in note 16 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements contains management’s current views of the effect such litigation will have on our financial results there can be no assurance that the outcome of such proceedings will be as expected 

for example there have been several lawsuits filed against us alleging that we violated us antitrust laws several lawsuits have been filed since 2000 in us district court in oregon alleging we had monopoly power or attempted to gain monopoly power for alder logs and finished alder lumber in the pacific northwest market the alder cases in 2006 a series of lawsuits against us and other manufacturers of oriented strand board osb were consolidated into one case in the us district court in pennsylvania on behalf of purchasers of osb the lawsuit alleged that the manufacturers conspired to fix and raise osb prices and caused the purchasers of osb to pay artificially inflated prices in the event liability is found in an antitrust case the damages proved at trial are trebled jury verdicts and damages imposed against us in two of the alder cases were vacated as a result of a ruling by the us supreme court in our favor in one of the alder cases and we have settled three of these cases but one case is still pending in the osb case the us district court issued a number of rulings approving classaction status for various classes of direct and indirect purchasers for the period june 2002 through february 2006 we settled with both classes of purchasers in first quarter 2008 

it is possible that there could be adverse judgments against us in some or all major litigation against us and that we could be required to take a charge for all or a portion of any damage award any such charge could materially and adversely affect our results of operations for the quarter or year in which we record it 

export taxes 

we may be required to pay significant export taxes or countervailing and antidumping duties for exported products 

we may experience reduced revenues and margins on some of our businesses as a result of export taxes or countervailing and antidumping duty applications for example in 2001 a group of companies filed petitions with the us department of commerce and the international trade commission claiming that production of softwood lumber in canada was being subsidized by canada and that imports into the us from canada were being sold in us markets at less than their fair value we have softwood lumber facilities in canada that export lumber into the us we paid a total of 370 million in deposits for countervailing duty and antidumping tariffs from 2002 through 2006 related to those lumber exports the us and canadian governments reached a settlement of the dispute in 2006 as a result of the settlement we received a refund of 344 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 however our canadian softwood lumber facilities will have to pay an export tax when the price of lumber is at or below a threshold price the export tax could be as high as 225 percent if a province exceeds its total allotted export share similar types of actions have been initiated from time to time against us and other us producers of products such as paper or lumber by countries such as china and korea it is possible that countervailing duty and antidumping tariffs or similar types of tariffs could be imposed on us in the future we may experience reduced revenues and margins in any business that is subject to such tariffs or to the terms of the settlements of such international disputes these tariffs or settlement terms could have a material adverse effect on our business financial results and financial condition including facility closures or impairments of assets 

natural disasters 

our business and operations could be adversely affected by weather fire infestation or natural disasters 

our timberlands assets may be damaged by adverse weather severe wind and rainstorms fires pest infestation or other natural disasters because our manufacturing processes primarily use wood fiber in many cases from our own timberlands in the event of material damage to our timberlands our operations could be disrupted or our production costs could be increased 

 

 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

 

stockprice volatility 

the price of our common stock may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors some of which are beyond our control including those described above under “risks related to our industries and business” and the following 

 

   

       in addition there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in the forest products industry that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 

some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them if litigation of this type is brought against us it could result in substantial costs and would divert management’s attention and resources

 management’s discussion 

and analysis mda of 

financial condition and 

results of operations 

 

 

what you will find in this mda 

 

our mda includes the following major sections 

 

        

 

economic and market conditions affecting our operations 

 

a variety of market conditions in both the us and global economies influenced demand and pricing for our products and affected our operating results in 2008 those market conditions included the following 

economic growth 

although the us economy grew only 13 percent on average in 2008 it declined dramatically in the second half of the year gross domestic product gdp contracted in the last two quarters of the year and job losses accelerated unemployment was 49 percent in the first quarter but was near 7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 

global economic growth also slowed dramatically in 2008 this includes developing asian markets particularly china which is an important market for our pulp products 

interest rates 

due to turmoil in the financial markets the us federal reserve took measures to lower shortterm interest rates 43 percent over the course of 2008 however that did not translate into lower mortgage rates since most investors were selling private longterm debt instruments and were buying treasury securities for safety 

  

housing market 

us singlefamily housing starts fell from 104 million units in 2007 to 622000 units in 2008 this 40 percent decline masks the dramatic fall in the latter part of the year by year end the annualized singlefamily start rate was near 400000 units a decline of 62 percent from 2007 totals home prices fell dramatically as well ending the year 124 percent below fourth quarter 2007 levels 

us dollar 

the us dollar surged in value against the canadian dollar and the euro in the second half of 2008 lowering the relative costs for competitors in canada and europe the canadian dollar is important for lumber and pulp prices while the euro is important for pulp prices changes in the exchange rate of these currencies have a direct effect on prices of our products 

 

 

how economic and market conditions affected our operations 

 

major effects that economic and market conditions had on our operations in 2008 included 

 

     home sales and singlefamily starts decreased 

tighter lending standards and high inventories of homes available for sale led to a sharp drop in newhome sales and singlefamily starts in 2008 

lumber structural panel and engineered wood product consumption decreased 

in 2008 

as singlefamily home starts fell further from the 2005 peak demand for lumber structural panels and engineered wood 

  

   

products decreased in 2008 the decrease in demand for wood products has resulted in a decrease in product prices 

domestic and export log prices fell 

log prices typically follow product prices but with a lag that varies by region the lag for southern log prices is longer than in the western us markets domestic log prices in the western us decreased 16 percent in 2008 compared with 2007 lower housing starts in japan and the drop in domestic log prices caused export log prices to decline in 2008 

market pulp prices rose slightly in 2008 

market pulp prices rose 5 percent in 2008 despite a fourthquarter plunge due to a sharp decline in demand and the appreciation of the us dollar high fiber costs in europe and canada a weak us dollar and tight operating conditions supported pulp prices through the first half of 2008 

where we are headed 

at this time market conditions for 2009 are extremely difficult to anticipate we expect economic activity will continue to be weak through the first quarter of 2009 and are uncertain when recovery will occur it is difficult to predict the ultimate result of the unprecedented level of intervention from the us government or the actions by the federal reserve it also remains an extremely uncertain period for the key factors affecting our businesses

results of operations 

 

in december 2008 the board of directors approved an amendment to our bylaws to adopt a december 31 fiscal yearend effective for the fiscal yearend 2008 prior to 2008 our fiscal year ended on the last sunday of the calendar year as a result the number of weeks in our fiscal year varied for the last three years 

 

   in reviewing our results of operations it is important to understand these terms 

 

    consolidated results 

net sales and revenue and operating income numbers reported in our consolidated results do not include the activity of our discontinued operations 

 

      we report these activities and results as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of earnings however we include the results of these operations in the segment discussions that follow see note 3 discontinued operations and assets held for sale in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information about our discontinued operations

   asset impairments and related charges 

we continually monitor our assets for potential impairment particularly in light of market conditions the upheaval in financial markets during the fourth quarter of 2008 was accompanied by accelerated deterioration of housing markets and a continued decline in demand and pricing for most of our wood products in addition declining demand in emerging asian markets primarily china adversely affected our cellulose fibers operations we recognized significant asset impairments in our real estate segment during the first three quarters of 2008 and the accelerated deterioration of market conditions triggered additional impairments in the fourth quarter the continued deterioration of market conditions also led to a fairvalue analysis that indicated the carrying value of the goodwill in our wood products and cellulose fibers segments was impaired in fourth quarter 2008 

  

   

our asset impairments and related charges increased 18 billion – from approximately 320 million in 2007 to approximately 21 billion in 2008 the increase included 

 

  partially offsetting these increased charges is a 23 million decrease in impairments recorded in connection with closures curtailments or sales of operations 

net sales and revenues 

net sales and revenues decreased significantly primarily due to continued deterioration of the us housing market declines in residential homebuilding throughout the nation have resulted in lower demand for residential building products such as softwood lumber oriented strand board osb and engineered lumber sales of products within our wood products segment excluding those of discontinued operations were 19 billion – 34 percent – lower than 2007 these difficult market conditions also affected our real estate segment where net sales and revenues decreased  951 million – 40 percent – from 2007 

net earnings 

net earnings decreased 2 billion primarily due to the factors listed below 

reductions to pretax net earnings included 

 

      partially offsetting these reductions to pretax net earnings were 

 

   

  

    

  

   

  in addition income tax expense increased 211 million taxes related to gains from discontinued operation transactions increased approximately 1 billion primarily related to the sale of our containerboard packaging and recycling business in 2008 this change was largely offset by tax benefits related to our increased loss from continuing operations as compared with 2007 and a 57 million benefit we recognized related to timber provisions in the food conservation and energy act tree act of 2008 

comparing 2007 with 2006 

in 2007 

 

  net sales and revenues 

net sales and revenues decreased primarily due to continued deterioration of the us housing market declines in residential homebuilding throughout the nation have resulted in lower demand for residential building products such as softwood lumber plywood osb and engineered lumber sales of these products within our wood products segment excluding those of discontinued operations were 22 billion – 28 percent – lower than 2006 these difficult market conditions also affected our real estate segment where net sales and revenues decreased 976 million – 29 percent – from 2006 

the decreases in our wood products and real estate segments were partially offset by improved market conditions for core products in our containerboard packaging and recycling segment which resulted in increased net sales and revenues of 256 million 

  

   

net earnings 

net earnings increased 337 million primarily due to several significant but largely offsetting factors 

increases to pretax net earnings included 

 

    

  

   

  

  reductions to pretax net earnings included 

 

    in addition income tax expense decreased 566 million pretax earnings from continuing operations were substantially lower in 2007 and the significant gain recognized on the us portion of the domtar transaction was nontaxable

  these decreases were partially offset by increases in the sales of nonstrategic timberlands in the us 

intersegment sales 

the 340 million decrease in intersegment sales was primarily due to the following 

 

   contribution to earnings 

the 137 million decrease in contribution to earnings resulted from 

 

     these decreases were partially offset by the following 

 

   our outlook 

fourth quarter 2008 operating earnings reflected continued weak domestic markets and reduced fee harvest volumes we do not expect markets to improve in the first quarter of 2009 we expect first quarter 2009 earnings to be comparable to the fourth quarter of 2008 as challenging market conditions persist 

  

wood products

we report sales volume and annual production data for our wood products business segment in our businesswhat we dowood products

net sales and revenues and contribution charge to earnings for wood products 

 

 comparing 2008 with 2007 

in 2008 

 

   asset impairments 

the accelerated deterioration of market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2008 adversely affected the results of our wood products operations and led to a fairvalue analysis that indicated the carrying value of the goodwill in our ilevel reporting unit was impaired 

  

   

the fairvalue analysis takes into account 

 

   based on the results of the fairvalue analysis we recognized a goodwill impairment of 733 million in the wood products segment in the fourth quarter of 2008 total goodwill impairments in 2008 for the segment were 743 million 

during 2008 we also recognized 98 million of other assetimpairment charges in the wood products segment in connection with the expected closure curtailment or sale of operations this compares with total wood products assetimpairment charges of 119 million in 2007 

net sales and revenues 

net sales and revenues decreased 19 billion – 34 percent – primarily due to the following 

 

         contribution charge to earnings 

contribution to earnings decreased 813 million primarily due to the following 

 

    

these decreases were partially offset by the following 

 

   in addition contribution to earnings increased due to reductions in raw material warehousing and delivery costs however these reductions were offset by increased manufacturing costs resulting from reduced operating postures and ongoing costs at curtailed facilities 

comparing 2007 with 2006 

in 2007 

 

  net sales and revenues 

net sales and revenues decreased 22 billion primarily due to the following 

 

    contribution charge to earnings 

contribution to earnings decreased 12 billion primarily due to the decline in residential homebuilding and the resulting effects on product price and shipment volume us census statistics show that singlefamily housing starts declined 29 percent from 2006 to 2007 decreases in wood products contribution to earnings included the following 

 

    

   

    

     

  these decreases were partially offset by lower raw material manufacturing and selling and general administrative costs which increased the contribution to earnings by approximately 290 million 

our outlook 

the segment recognized a fourthquarter loss of 960 million which included 761 million of charges for asset impairments closures and restructuring activities the operating results reflected significantly lower prices for lumber and oriented strand board and reduced sales volumes as a result of the continued decline in the housing market we expect challenging housing market conditions to continue into the first quarter 2009 and expect firstquarter results for the segment to be comparable to the fourth quarter of 2008 excluding asset impairment closure and restructuring charges

net sales and revenues and contribution to earnings for cellulose fibers 

 

 comparing 2008 with 2007 

in 2008 

 

   asset impairments 

the accelerated deterioration of market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2008 was accompanied by a sudden and dramatic decline in demand for pulp from developing asian markets and a severe downturn in the global pulp market which resulted in a significant decline in pulp prices these developments led to a fairvalue analysis that indicated the carrying value of the goodwill in our cellulose fibers reporting unit was impaired 

the fairvalue analysis takes into account 

 

   based on the results of the fairvalue analysis we recognized a goodwill impairment of 94 million in the cellulose fibers segment in the fourth quarter of 2008 

  

   

net sales and revenues 

net sales and revenues decreased 4 percent for the year primarily due to a decrease in pulp sales volume which was partially offset by an increase in average price realizations for pulp and liquid packaging board 

for the full year 2008 compared with 2007 

 

     contribution to earnings 

contribution to earnings decreased 82 million primarily due to the following 

 

      these decreases were partially offset by the following 

 

     

comparing 2007 with 2006 

in 2007 

 

  net sales and revenues 

net sales and revenues decreased 124 million primarily due to a decrease in pulp sales volume which was partially offset by an increase in average price realizations for pulp and liquid packaging board 

 

    

  contribution to earnings 

contribution to earnings increased 87 million primarily due to the following 

 

  partially offsetting these increases in earnings were the following 

 

      

   

our outlook 

the segment recognized a loss of 29 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 which included the 94 million goodwill impairment charge fourthquarter results were also adversely affected by lower pulp price realizations reduced shipment volumes and lower operating rates as we slowed production to match declining demand weaker pulp prices were partially offset by increased earnings in our liquid packaging and newsprint businesses 

the global pulp market suffered a sudden decline in the fourth quarter of 2008 we expect firstquarter 2009 earnings for this segment to be significantly lower than the fourth quarter of 2008 excluding the goodwill impairment charge we anticipate lower pulp prices and increased costs related to annual maintenance we will continue to manage production to meet declining demand 

 

 

  

real estate

key data from singlefamily operations 

 

 the housing market continued to deteriorate during 2008 particularly in three of our key geographies – southern california nevada and arizona 

for the real estate segment as a whole 

 

    

   

 comparing 2008 with 2007 

in 2008 

 

   impairments and preacquisition cost writeoffs 

we continually monitor our assets for potential impairment particularly in light of the current market conditions additionally we control some land through deposits with land sellers that defer the payment of the full acquisition price until certain entitlements are obtained we also control some land through structured options offered by land sellers 

in 2008 we recorded 874 million in impairments and other related charges for real estate projects joint ventures and intangible assets this compares with 128 million in impairments and other related charges for real estate projects recorded in 2007 there was a significant increase in impairments from the previous year due to the eroding market conditions for selling new homes and the inability for many home buyers to secure financing due to the changing mortgage market and tighter credit standards in addition during the fourth quarter of 2008 the alreadydepressed housing market was further affected by increased financial turmoil job losses both actual and announced and a loss of consumer confidence reduced the number of potential home buyers increasing foreclosures added inventory to the marketplace causing lower appraisal values and home sale prices 

in light of these deteriorating market conditions and increased uncertainty regarding the timing of recovery the company reviewed its homebuilding projects and land portfolio to determine whether the assets would continue to be held for development or sold during fourth quarter 2008 management decided to sell some of its land portfolio which required the company to write the land assets down to current fair value resulting in impairments impairments also were recorded on projects and land held for development 

in addition we recorded 128 million in impairments and other related charges for our real estate investments in 2008 compared with 36 million of investment impairments and other related charges in 2007 

in 2008 we also wrote off 74 million in costs associated with option deposits and other preacquisition costs related to land parcels that we decided not to acquire in 2007 we wrote off 6 million of option deposits and preacquisition costs

 impairments and preacquisition cost writeoffs 

in 2007 we recorded 128 million in impairments of real estate projects and intangible assets this was a significant increase in impairments from the previous year due to the challenging market conditions for selling new homes and the inability for many home buyers to secure financing due to the changing mortgage market and tighter credit standards in 2006 we recorded 36 million in impairments of real estate projects 

our outlook 

the segment’s contribution to earnings for fourth quarter 2008 was a loss of 630 million this included asset and investment impairment charges losses on land sales and restructuring costs totaling 614 million weyerhaeuser expects firstquarter home sale closings to be less than the fourth quarter due to seasonality and continuing weakness in the housing market excluding impairments land and other asset sales and restructuring charges the segment’s loss from homebuilding operations is expected to increase in the first quarter

stock offerings and option exercises 

our cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options were 

 

   we did not recognize any excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options during 2008 we recognized 51 million in 2007 due to the high volume of stock options exercised when the price of our common stock reached record highs during the first quarter of that year

longterm debt 

our consolidated longterm debt was 

 

   during 2008 we reduced overall debt – including that for our real estate segment – by approximately 13 billion

  see note 14 longterm debt in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

revolving credit facilities 

as of december 31 2008 weyerhaeuser company and wreco have two multiyear revolving credit facility agreements 

 

  wreco can borrow up to 400 million under each of these facilities neither of the entities is a guarantor of the borrowing of the other under either of these credit facilities 

as of december 31 2008 we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities and the entire amounts were available for incremental borrowings 

see note 12 shortterm borrowings and lines of credit in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

paying dividends and repurchasing stock 

over the last three years we paid dividends of 

 

   changes in the amount of dividends we paid were primarily due to the decrease in number of shares outstanding during 2008 and 2007 

  

   

during 2007 we completed the stockrepurchase program that was announced in october 2005 which authorized the repurchase of up to 18 million shares of our common stock since the authorization we repurchased 

 

   during 2007 we also redeemed 25 million shares in connection with the domtar transaction 

in december of 2008 the board of directors authorized the additional repurchase of up to 250 million of the company’s outstanding shares as of december 31 2008 no shares had been repurchased under this authorization 

in 2008 we paid a dividend but we had negative cash from operations this resulted in a negative dividendpayout ratio 

dividend payout ratios for the previous two years are 

 

  in december of 2008 the board of directors declared a dividend of 25 cents per share payable on march 2 2009 reducing the quarterly dividend from the previous level of 60 cents per share

accounting matters 

 

critical accounting policies 

our critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and estimates they also have a high degree of complexity 

in accounting we base our judgments and estimates on 

 

  actual results however may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded 

our most critical accounting policies relate to our 

 

    details about our other significant accounting policies – what we use and how we estimate – are in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  

pension and postretirement benefit plans 

we sponsor several pension and postretirement benefit plans for our employees key assumptions we use in accounting for the plans include our 

 

     at the end of every year we review our assumptions with external advisers and make adjustments as appropriate actual experience that differs from our assumptions or any changes in our assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

other factors that affect our accounting for the plans include 

 

   this section provides more information about our 

 

   expected longterm rate of returns 

plan assets are assets of the pension plan trusts that fund the benefits provided under the pension plan the expected longterm rate of return is our estimate of the longterm rate of return that our plan assets will earn after considering all available information at the end of 2008 we continue to assume an expected longterm rate of return on our plan assets of 95 percent factors we considered include 

 

  our expected longterm rate of return is important in determining the net income or expense we recognize for our plans every 05 percent decrease in our expected longterm rate of return would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately 

 

  likewise every 05 percent increase in our expected longterm rate of return would decrease expense or increase a credit by those same amounts 

  

   

the actual return on plan assets in any given year may vary from our expected longterm rate of return actual returns on plan assets affect the funded status of the plans differences between actual returns on plan assets and the expected long term rate of return are reflected as adjustments to cumulative other comprehensive income loss a component of total shareholders’ interest 

discount rate 

our discount rate as of december 31 2008 is 

 

  we review our discount rates annually and revise them as needed the discount rates are selected at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of highquality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits 

our discount rate is important in determining the cost of our plans a 05 percent decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately 

 

  pension and postretirement benefit expenses for 2009 will be based on the 63 percent assumed discount rate for us plans and the 73 percent assumed discount rate for the canadian plans 

contributions made and benefits paid 

during 2008 

 

    during 2009 

 

     

in addition we expect to be required to contribute to at least one of our us qualified pension plans for the 2009 plan year the required contribution is estimated to be between 50 million and 100 million and must be funded by september 15 2010 the final amount will depend on the remeasurement of the plans’ liabilities at january 1 2009 and the final value of the trust assets as of that date which will be available later in 2009 

receivable from pension trust 

during 2008 there was a high volume of lumpsum distributions from our us qualified pension plans retirementeligible employees whose employment with the company terminated in connection with the sale of our containerboard packaging and recycling business or corporate restructuring activities could elect to receive their pension benefit as a lumpsum distribution if permitted in accordance with the plans’ provisions in addition recent market events have adversely affected liquidity for instance many of the funds in which plan assets are invested have changed their redemption terms delaying some of the pension trusts’ expected cash receipts to avoid liquidating assets at depressed prices and as permitted by law we elected to provide approximately 200 million of shortterm liquidity to the us pension trust through shortterm loans these shortterm loans were made in the fourth quarter of 2008 repayment by the pension trust is planned in 2009 

longlived assets and goodwill 

we review the carrying value of our longlived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations the carrying value is the amount assigned to longlived assets – including goodwill – in our books in addition we review the amount of goodwill we carry on our books in the fourth quarter of every year 

an impairment occurs when the fair market value of our goodwill drops below our carrying value or when the carrying value of longlived assets will not be recovered from future cash flows fair market value is the estimated amount we would get if we were to sell the assets 

in determining fair market value and whether impairment has occurred we are required to estimate 

 

     

   

key assumptions we use in developing the estimates include 

 

     goodwill update 

the collapse of financial markets in the fourth quarter of 2008 accompanied by accelerated deterioration of housing markets declining demand and lower prices for pulp products led to a fairvalue analysis that indicated the carrying value of the goodwill in our ilevel and cellulose fibers reporting units was impaired 

in estimating the fair value of the reporting units we considered the following valuation methods 

 

  the fairvalue analysis took into account 

 

   based on the results of the fairvalue analysis we recognized 

 

  the total goodwill remaining on our balance sheet as of december 31 2008 was 43 million composed of 3 million in our wood products segment and 40 million in our timberlands segment 

legal environmental and product liability reserves 

we record contingent liabilities when 

 

  legal matters 

determining our liabilities for legal matters requires projections about the outcome of litigation and the amount of our financial responsibility we base our projections on 

 

  while we do our best in developing our projections litigation is still inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts occur details about our legal exposures and proceedings are dis cussed in note 16 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  these exposures and proceedings are significant ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flow in any given quarter or year 

environmental matters 

determining our liabilities for environmental matters requires estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs we base our estimates on 

 

    product liability matters 

we record reserves for contingent productliability matters when it becomes probable we will make financial payment determining the amount of reserves we record requires projections of future claim rates and amounts the hardboard siding reserve is our sole material productliability reserve and is discussed in detail under note 16 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

depletion 

we record depletion – the costs attributed to timber harvested – as trees are harvested 

to calculate our depletion rate which is updated annually we 

 

  estimating the volume of timber available for harvest over the harvest cycle requires the consideration of the following factors 

 

       in addition the length of the harvest cycle varies by geographic region and species of timber 

  

   

depletionrate calculations do not include estimates for

 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

 

longterm debt obligations 

 

the following summary of our longterm debt obligations includes 

 

   we estimate the fair value of longterm debt based on quoted market prices we received for the same types and issues of our debt or on the discounted value of the future cash flows using market yields for the same type and comparable issues of debt changes in market rates of interest affect the fair value of our fixedrate debt 

summary of longterm debt obligations as of december 31 2008 

 

  

 

our use of derivatives 

 

we occasionally use derivatives to 

 

   the fair value of our derivatives may vary due to the volatility of the underlying forward prices or index rates associated with them 

  

commodity futures swaps and collars 

as of december 31 2008 we had the following commodity swap contracts 

 

  these contracts expire through the third quarter of 2009 

the forward purchases were designated as cash flow hedges until offsetting forward sales were entered into in june 2008 as of december 31 2008 these contracts are not designated as hedges due to the offsetting forwardpurchase and forwardsale contracts changes in forward price levels are not expected to change the net fair value of our commodity swaps the net fair value of these swap contracts as of december 31 2008 was 9 million

our innovations and accomplishments through the years include 

 

   competition in our markets 

our major markets – both domestic and foreign – are highly competitive with numerous companies selling similar products many of our products also compete against substitutes for wood and woodfiber products in real estate development and other related activities we compete against numerous regional and national firms we compete in our markets primarily through price product quality and service levels 

  

   

our business segments compete based on the following strategies 

 

      our fine paper segment was divested in a 2007 transaction with domtar inc 

sales outside the us 

in 2007 18 percent – or 31 billion – of our total consolidated sales and revenues including sales from discontinued operations were to customers outside the us that included 

 

   in 2006 17 percent – or 38 billion – of our total consolidated sales and revenues including sales from discontinued operations were to customers outside the us that included 

 

   shaping our business 

we strategically manage our portfolio to enhance shareholder returns this ongoing process includes making key acquisitions to complement existing product lines or achieving greater scale in key operations it also means that we exit businesses that do not fit our longterm strategic direction and divest ourselves of nonstrategic assets 

key acquisition in recent years have included 

 

      

in march 2007 we completed the following set of transactions 

 

   collectively these transactions are referred to as the “domtar transaction” 

in june 2007 we sold our canadian wood products distribution centers 

other recent dispositions have included 

 

   we continue to reinvest in our businesses through a variety of capital projects in 2007 our capital expenditures – excluding acquisitions and our real estate business segment – totaled 706 million we expect these investments will 

 

   we are also focused on 

 

   our employees 

we have approximately 37900 employees this number includes 

 

  of these employees approximately 12000 are members of unions covered by multiyear collective bargaining agreements 

  

   

what we do 

this section provides information about how we grow and harvest trees manufacture and sell products made from them and build and sell homes for each of our business segments we provide details about what we do where we do it how much we sell and where we are headed 

timberlands 

our timberlands business segment manages 64 million acres of private commercial forestland in the us we own 57 million of those acres and lease the other 700000 acres in addition we have renewable longterm licenses on 151 million acres of forestland located in five canadian provinces information in the tables below includes data from all of the segment’s business units as of the end of 2007 

what we do 

we grow and harvest trees for use as lumber and other wood and building products we also export logs to other countries where they are made into products after harvest we typically plant seedlings to reforest the harvested areas using the most effective regeneration method for the site and species we monitor and care for the new trees as they grow to maturity we seek to sustain and maximize the timber supply from our forestlands while keeping the health of our environment a key priority we are recognized as a leading forest manager 

the goal of our timberlands business is to maximize returns by selling logs and stumpage to internal and external customers we focus on solid softwood and use intensive silviculture to improve forest productivity and returns while managing the forests on a sustainable basis to meet both customer and public expectations we capture additional value from our land and timber through the lease or sale of minerals oil gas recreation and communications sites sales of higherandbetteruse property and the sale of other nontimber products 

  

timberlands products and revenues 

 

 where we do it 

we manage a balanced portfolio of timberlands assets located primarily in north america in the us we own and manage sustainable forests in nine states for use in wood products manufacturing we own or lease 

 

  in addition we have renewable longterm licenses on 151 million acres of forestland located in five canadian provinces in canada forests generally are owned and administered by provincial governments 

we also own and manage forestlands in the southern hemisphere the results of these international operations are reported in the corporate and other segment 

our worldwide timber inventory is approximately 268 million cunits one cunit equals 100 cubic feet of solid wood the amount of timber inventory does not translate into an amount of lumber or panel products because the quantity of end products 

 

  as a result there is no standard for converting cubic feet of solid wood into board feet of lumber or square feet of panel products

locations 

 

 our timberlands annual fee depletion represents the harvest of the timber assets that we own depletion is a method of expensing the fee timber asset based on the harvest or timber sales volume the decline in fee depletion from 2004 through 2006 reflects the disposition of our bc coastal operations in may 2005 and the decline in fee depletion from 2006 to 2007 reflects the domtar transaction in march 2007 

the 2007 harvest volume by region was 55 percent in the south and 45 percent in the west

log sales volumes 

logs sold to unaffiliated customers in 2007 declined 355000 cunits or 10 percent from 2006 sales volumes from canada dropped 177000 in 2007 this reduction in volume was due primarily to the domtar transaction in march 2007 other factors that may affect our log sales volume include the following 

 

   all of our domestic and export logs are sold to unaffiliated customers or transferred at market prices to our internal mills by sales and marketing staff within our timberlands business units 

fiveyear summary of log sales volumes to unaffiliated customers for timberlands  12 

 

   

log prices 

average log price realizations in 2007 were down as compared with 2006 primarily due to lower export and domestic log prices our log prices are affected by the supply of and demand for grade and fiber logs which are influenced by all of the factors described above

containerboard packaging and recycling volumes 

we are the secondlargest producer of corrugated packaging products in north america 

 

   factors that affect sales volumes of containerboard packaging and recycling products and services include 

 

     our volume of containerboard sales increased in 2007 as a result of a rise in export sales compensating for the decline in packaging volume our packaging sales declined in 2007 because of the closure of eight plants and the sale of two others in 2006 and due to the effect of cold weather and e coli on produce markets during the first quarter of 2007 our sales volume in the kraft bag market increased in 2007 as the startup of a new facility in the second quarter of 2007 more than offset the closure of another bag plant in 2006

where we’re headed 

during 2007 this segment continued to refine its business model implemented in 2006 shifting from a plantfocused management model to a customerfocused integrated supplychain model our strategies for achieving continued success include 

 

      

our research and development activity in this segment is focused in two primary areas recyclable products that would replace waxed corrugated package products and radiofrequency identification rfid for corrugated packages we are commercializing our line of recyclable waxreplacement products called clima series™ and have demonstrated success in applying rfid tags to corrugated boxes 

the proposed banning of plastic grocery bags in several major municipalities offers the potential to further expand the kraft bag market 

strategic review 

on may 4 2007 we announced that our board of directors had authorized a process to consider a broad range of strategic alternatives for our containerboard packaging and recycling business alternatives range from continuing to hold and operate the assets to a possible sale or business combination as of the date of this filing this strategic review is ongoing

    how much we sell 

we are one of the top 20 homebuilding companies in the us as measured by annual singlefamily home closings 

our revenues decreased from 33 billion in 2006 to 24 billion in 2007 primarily due to a 24 percent decline in singlefamily closings the decline is the result of a general housingmarket downturn caused by excess supply and slow demand this was worsened by the changing mortgage market which resulted in tightened credit standards

natural resource and environmental matters 

growing and harvesting timber is subject to numerous laws and regulations to protect the environment nontimber resources such as wildlife and water and other social values changes in those laws and regulations can significantly affect local or regional timber harvest levels and market values of timberbased raw materials 

endangered species protections 

in the us a number of fish and wildlife species that inhabit geographic areas near or within our timberlands have been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal endangered species act esa or similar state laws some of these listed species include the northern spotted owl the marbled murrelet a number of salmon species bull trout and steelhead trout in the pacific northwest and the redcockaded woodpecker gopher tortoise and american burying beetle in the southeast additional species or populations may be listed as a result of pending or future citizen petitions or may be initiated by federal or state agencies 

federal and state requirements to protect habitat for threatened and endangered species have resulted in restrictions on timber harvest on some timberlands including some of our timberlands additional listings of fish and wildlife species as endangered threatened or sensitive under the esa and similar state laws as well as regulatory actions taken by federal or state agencies to protect habitat for these species may in the future result in additional restrictions on our timber harvests and other forest management practices they also could increase our operating costs and affect timber supply and prices in general 

regulations affecting forestry practices 

in the us regulations established by the federal state and local governments or agencies to protect water quality and wetlands could affect our future harvests and forest management practices on some of our timberlands forest practice acts in some states in the us increasingly affect present or future harvest and forest management activities for example in some states these acts limit the size of clearcuts require some timber to be left unharvested to protect water quality and fish and wildlife habitat regulate construction and maintenance of forest roads require reforestation following timber harvest and contain procedures for state agencies to review and approve proposed forest practice activities some states and local governments regulate certain forest practices through various permit programs each state in which we own timberlands has developed best management practices to reduce the effects of forest practices on water quality and aquatic hab itats additional and more stringent regulations may be adopted by various state and local governments to achieve waterquality standards under the federal clean water act protect fish and wildlife habitats or achieve other public policy objectives 

forest certification standards 

we operate in the us under the sustainable forestry initiative ®  this is a certification standard designed to supplement government regulatory programs with voluntary landowner initiatives to further protect certain public resources and values the sustainable forestry initiative ® is an independent standard overseen by a governing board consisting of conservation organizations academia the forest industry and large and small forest landowners compliance with the sustainable forestry initiative ® may result in some increases in our operating costs and curtailment of our timber harvests in some areas 

what these regulations and certification programs mean to us 

the regulatory and nonregulatory forest management programs described above have increased our operating costs resulted in changes in the value of timber and logs from our timberlands and contributed to increases in the prices paid for wood products and wood chips during periods of high demand these kinds of programs also can make it more difficult for us to respond to rapid changes in markets extreme weather or other unexpected circumstances one additional effect may be further reductions in the usage of or substitution of other products for lumber and plywood we believe that these kinds of programs have not had and in 2008 will not have a significant effect on the total harvest of timber in the us or any major us region however these kinds of programs may have such an effect in the future we expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these programs as compared with typical owners of comparable timberlands we also expect that these programs will not significantly disrupt our planned operations over large areas or for extended periods 

regulations and forest certification in canada 

our forest operations in canada are carried out on public forestlands under forest licenses all forest operations are subject to forest practices and environmental regulations and operations under licenses also are subject to contractual requirements between us and the relevant province designed to protect environmental and other social values in canada the federal species at risk act sara was enacted in 2002 sara enacted protective measures for species identified as being at risk and for critical habitat to date sara has not had a significant effect on our operations however it is anticipated that sara will over time result in some additional restrictions on timber harvests and other forest management practices and increase 

  

   

some operating costs for operators of forestlands in canada for these reasons sara is expected to affect timber supply and prices in the future 

in canada we participate in the canadian standards association sustainable forest management system standard a voluntary certification system that further protects certain public resources and values compliance with this standard will result in some increases in our operating costs and curtailment of our timber harvests in some areas in canada 

canadian aboriginal rights 

many of the canadian forestlands also are subject to the constitutionally protected treaty or commonlaw rights of the aboriginal peoples of canada in the british columbia province most of british columbia bc is not covered by treaties and as a result the claims of bc’s aboriginal peoples relating to forest resources are largely unresolved although many aboriginal groups are actively engaged in treaty discussions with the governments of bc and canada final or interim resolution of claims brought by aboriginal groups is expected to result in additional restrictions on the sale or harvest of timber and may increase operating costs and affect timber supply and prices in canada we believe that such claims will not have a significant effect on our total harvest of timber or production of forest products in 2008 although they may have such an effect in the future 

pollution control regulations 

our operations also are subject to federal state and provincial and local pollution controls with regard to air water and land solid and hazardous waste management disposal and remediation laws and regulations in all areas in which we have operations we also are subject to market demands with respect to chemical content of some of our products and our use of recycled fiber compliance with these laws regulations and demands usually involves capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs we cannot easily quantify the future amounts of capital expenditures we might have to make to comply with these laws regulations and demands or the effects on our operating costs because in some instances compliance standards have not been developed or have not become final or definitive in addition when we make changes in operations to comply with regulatory standards we frequently are making changes for other purposes as well these purposes might include the extension of facility life increase in capacity changes in raw material requirements or increase in economic value of assets or products 

it is difficult to isolate the environmental component of most manufacturing capital projects but we estimate that our capital expenditures for environmental compliance were approximately 14 million in 2007 approximately 2 percent of total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and real estate based on our understanding of current regulatory requirements in the us and canada we expect that capital expenditures for environmental compliance will be approximately 24 million in 2008 approximately 4 percent of expected total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and real estate 

environmental cleanup 

we are involved in the environmental investigation or remediation of numerous sites which we presently own or formerly owned of these sites we may have the sole obligation to remediate or may share that obligation with one or more parties in some instances several parties have joint and several obligations to remediate some sites are superfund sites where we have been named as a potentially responsible party our liability with respect to these various sites ranges from insignificant to substantial the amount of liability depends on the quantity toxicity and nature of materials at the site and depends on the number and economic viability of the other responsible parties 

we spent approximately 10 million in 2007 and expect to spend approximately 10 million in 2008 on environmental remediation of these sites it is our policy to accrue for environmental remediation costs when we determine it is probable that such an obligation exists and can reasonably estimate the amount of the obligation we currently believe it is reasonably possible that our costs to remediate all the identified sites may exceed our current accruals of 27 million the excess amounts required may be insignificant or could range in the aggregate up to approximately 37 million over several years this estimate of the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs is much less certain than the estimates we currently are using to determine how much to accrue the estimate of the upper range also uses assumptions less favorable to us among the range of reasonably possible outcomes 

regulation of air emissions in the us 

the united states environmental protection agency us epa has promulgated regulations for air emissions from pulp and paper manufacturing facilities these regulations cover hazardous air pollutants that require use of maximum achievable control technology mact and controls for pollutants that contribute to smog and haze due to a recent dc circuit court decision the us epa mact standards for air emissions from industrial boilers and certain wood products emissions units were vacated the us epa must promulgate new mact standards for these sources we anticipate that we might spend as much as 20 million over the next few years to comply with the mact standards we cannot currently quantify the amount of capital we will need in the future to comply with new regulations being developed by the us epa or canadian environmental 

  

  

  

agencies because final rules have not been promulgated however at this time we anticipate that compliance with the new regulations will not result in capital expenditures in any year that are material in relation to our annual capital expenditures 

we recently adopted a goal of reducing greenhouse gas ghg emissions by 40 percent by 2020 compared with our emissions in 2000 assuming a comparable portfolio and regulations we intend to achieve this goal by increasing energy efficiency and by using systems that enable substitution of greenhouse gasneutral biomass fuels for highpriced fossil fuels as each of our power and recovery boilers reaches its design life span over the next 14 years we may replace the boiler with a stateoftheart system during 2007 we completed the divestment of our fine paper operations and related assets in the domtar transaction the transaction removed several high greenhouse gasemitting operations from the company’s portfolio of manufacturing in accord with generally accepted voluntary ghg accounting standards we adjusted our baseline year 2000 values and subsequent year greenhouse gas inventory values to reflect these changes we continue with our planned replacements of recovery and power boiler units in accord with our budgeted capital expenditure programs these replacements will allow an increase in the amount of energy obtained from the biomass byproducts created in the pulping process we also anticipate being able to reduce the purchase of electric power by up to 50 percent through improvements in energy efficiency and by increasing the use of combined heat and power technology 

in april 2007 the us supreme court ruled that greenhouse gases are pollutants that can be subject to regulation under the us clean air act as a result of this ruling the us epa may regulate greenhouse gas emissions some us state governments also have released policy proposals that indicate they may regulate ghg emissions in the future 

it is not yet known when and to what extent these us federal and state policy activities may come into force or how any future federal and state greenhouse gas regulatory programs may relate to each other a multistate and federal greenhouse gas emissions reduction trading system may be put in place in the future with potentially significant implications for us businesses we believe these measures have not had and in 2008 will not have a significant effect on weyerhaeuser’s us operations although they may have such an effect in the future we expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with typical owners of comparable operations we also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations 

  

regulation of air emissions in canada 

we also are actively participating in negotiations between the forest products association of canada and natural resources canada to define industry obligations for complying with canada’s national plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions over the next several years during 2007 we continued our work with international national and regional policy makers in their efforts to develop technically sound and economically viable policies practices and procedures for measuring reporting and managing greenhouse gas emissions 

in april 2007 the canadian federal government proposed a regulatory framework for air emissions that adopts some aspects of the kyoto protocol the federal framework calls for mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for heavy industrial emissions producers among other measures to be put in place by 2010 canadian provincial governments also are working on emissionsreduction strategies it is not yet known what strategies or requirements will come into force or how any provincial and federal plans that may be put into place will relate to each other a canadian emissions trading system may be put in place in the future with potentially significant implications for canadian businesses we believe these measures have not had and in 2008 will not have a significant effect on weyerhaeuser’s canadian operations although they may have such an effect in the future we expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with typical owners of comparable operations we also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations 

potential changes in pollution regulation 

the us epa has repealed the regulations promulgated in 2000 that would have required states to develop total maximum daily load tmdl allocations for pollutants in water bodies determined to be waterqualityimpaired however states continue to promulgate tmdl requirements the state tmdl requirements may set limits on pollutants that may be discharged to a body of water or set additional requirements such as best management practices for nonpoint sources including timberland operations to reduce the amounts of pollutants it is not possible to estimate the capital expenditures that may be required for the company to meet pollution allocations across the various proposed state tmdl programs until a specific tmdl is promulgated

 risk factors 

we are subject to certain risks and events that if one or more of them occur could adversely affect our business our financial condition and our results of operations and the trading price of our common stock 

you should consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information presented in this report and the matters described in “forwardlooking statements” as well as the other reports and registration statements we file from time to time with the sec in evaluating us our business and an investment in our securities 

the risks below are not the only risks we face additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely affect our business 

 

risks related to our industries and business 

cyclical industries 

the industries in which we operate are highly cyclical fluctuations in the prices of and the demand for our products could result in smaller profit margins and lower sales volumes 

our businesses are highly cyclical historically economic and market shifts fluctuations in capacity and changes in foreign currency exchange rates and mortgage interest rates have created cyclical changes in prices sales volume and margins for our products the length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time and by product but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions and levels of industry capacity 

many of our products are commodities that are widely available from other producers because commodity products have few distinguishing properties from producer to producer competition for these products is based primarily on price which is determined by supply relative to demand 

the overall levels of demand for the products we manufacture and distribute and consequently our sales and profitability reflect fluctuations in levels of enduser demand which depend in part on general macroeconomic conditions in north america and worldwide and local economic conditions and competition from substitute products 

changes in the following are some of the factors that may adversely affect our businesses and the results of operations 

 

         industry supply of logs pulp paper packaging and wood products also is subject to fluctuation as changing industry conditions may cause producers to idle or permanently close individual machines or entire mills or to decrease harvesting levels in addition to avoid substantial cash costs in connection with idling or closing a mill some producers choose to continue to operate at a loss which could prolong weak prices due to oversupply oversupply also may result from producers introducing new capacity or increasing harvest levels in response to favorable shortterm pricing trends 

industry supply of pulp paper and containerboard also are influenced by overseas production capacity which has grown in recent years and is expected to continue to grow while the weakness of the us dollar has mitigated the levels of imports in recent years imports of pulp paper and containerboard from overseas may increase resulting in lower prices 

prices for our products are affected by many factors outside of our control and we will have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes which often are volatile because market conditions beyond our control determine the prices for our commodity products the price for any one or more of these products may fall below our cash production costs requiring us either to incur cash losses on product sales or cease production at one or more of our manufacturing facilities or curtail harvest levels our profitability with respect to these products depends on managing our costs particularly raw material and energy costs which represent significant components of our operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control as described below if the prices of or demand for our products declines if our raw material or energy costs increase or both our sales and profitability could be materially and adversely affected 

substitution 

some of our products are vulnerable to declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials 

our products may compete with nonfiberbased alternatives or with alternative products in certain market segments for example plastic packaging may be used as an alternative to our corrugated packaging business products and plastic woodplastic or composite materials may be used by builders as alternatives to the products produced by our wood products businesses such as lumber veneer plywood and oriented strand changes in prices for oil chemicals and woodbased 

  

   

fiber can change the competitive position of our products relative to available alternatives and could increase substitution of those products for our products as the use of these alternatives grows demand for our products may further decline 

changes in product mix or pricing 

our results of operation and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by changes in product mix or pricing 

our results may be affected by a change in our sales mix our outlook assumes a certain volume and product mix of sales if actual results vary from this projected volume and product mix of sales our operations and our results could be negatively affected our outlook also assumes we will be successful in implementing previously announced price increases as well as future price increases delays in acceptance of price increases could negatively affect our results moreover price discounting if required to maintain our competitive position could result in lower than anticipated price realizations 

intense competition 

we face intense competition in our markets and the failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we compete with north american and for many of our product lines global producers some of which may have greater financial resources and lower production costs than we do the principal basis for competition is selling price our ability to maintain satisfactory margins depends in large part on our ability to control our costs our industries are also particularly sensitive to other factors including innovation design quality and service with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line to the extent that one or more of our competitors become more successful with respect to any key competitive factor our ability to attract and retain customers could be materially adversely affected we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively and maintain current levels of sales and profitability if we are unable to compete effectively such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

availability of raw materials and energy 

our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials and energy 

we rely heavily on certain raw materials principally wood fiber and chemicals and energy sources principally natural gas electricity coal and fuel oil in our manufacturing processes our ability to increase earnings has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials and energy sources we may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material or energy costs through hedging arrangements price increases productivity improvements or costreduction programs 

transportation 

we depend on third parties for transportation services and increases in costs and the availability of transportation could materially adversely affect our business and operations 

our business depends on the transportation of a large number of products both domestically and internationally we rely primarily on third parties for transportation of the products we manufacture andor distribute as well as delivery of our raw materials in particular a significant portion of the goods we manufacture and raw materials we use are transported by railroad or trucks which are highly regulated 

if any of our thirdparty transportation providers were to fail to deliver the goods we manufacture or distribute in a timely manner we may be unable to sell those products at full value—or at all similarly if any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner we may be unable to manufacture our products in response to customer demand in addition if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us we may be unable to replace them at reasonable cost 

any failure of a thirdparty transportation provider to deliver raw materials or finished products in a timely manner could harm our reputation negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation 

in addition an increase in transportation rates or fuel surcharges could materially adversely affect our sales and profitability 

material disruption of manufacturing 

a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales or negatively affect our results of operation and financial condition 

any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

 

       

   

       any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products andor require us to make unplanned capital expenditures if one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired resulting in lower sales and income 

capital requirements 

our operations require substantial capital 

capital expenditures for expansion or replacement of existing facilities or equipment may be substantial although we maintain our production equipment with regular periodic and scheduled maintenance we cannot assure you that key pieces of equipment in our various production processes will not need to be repaired or replaced and major equipment may need to be replaced periodically the costs of repairing or replacing such equipment and the associated downtime of the affected production line could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

based on our current operations we believe our cash flow from operations and other capital resources will be adequate to meet our operating needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements for the foreseeable future if for any reason we are unable to provide for our operating needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements on economic terms we could experience a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

environmental laws and regulations 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with violations of or liabilities under applicable environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to a wide range of general and industryspecific laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing 

 

         in particular the pulp and paper industry in the us is subject to cluster rules and boiler maximum achievable control technology rules that further regulate effluent and air emissions these laws and regulations will require us to obtain authorizations from and comply with the authorization requirements of the appropriate governmental authorities which have considerable discretion over the terms and timing of permits 

we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations and as a result of remedial obligations we also could incur substantial costs such as civil or criminal fines sanctions and enforcement actions including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions cleanup and closure costs and thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations 

as the owner and operator of real estate we may be liable under environmental laws for cleanup closure and other damages resulting from the presence and release of hazardous substances on or from our properties or operations the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict and in some cases our liability may exceed forecasted amounts or the value of the property itself the discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at our sites or thirdparty sites may result in significant additional costs any material liability we incur could adversely affect our financial condition or preclude us from making capital expenditures that otherwise would benefit our business 

enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretation of these laws or regulations might require significant expenditures

part ii 




 gal proceedings 

we are a party to a number of legal proceedings and adverse judgments in certain legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

the costs and other effects of pending litigation against us and related insurance recoveries cannot be determined with certainty although the disclosure in “legal proceedings” and note 16 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” contains management’s current views when possible of the effect such litigation will have on our financial results there can be no assurance that the outcome of such proceedings will be as expected 

for example in 1999 the equity committee in the paragon trade brands inc bankruptcy proceeding sued us for breach of warranties in agreements between us and paragon relating to paragon’s initial public stock offering the bankruptcy court held us liable for breaches of warranty and imposed damages of approximately 470 million the us district court overturned the decision and directed the bankruptcy court to enter judgment in favor of the company but the litigation claims representative has appealed the decision to the 11th circuit court of appeals we believe that we will prevail on the appeal and we have not established a reserve for this litigation because we believe that the requirements for establishing a reserve under statement of financial accounting standards no 5 accounting for contingencies statement 5 have not been met however it is possible in the future that there could be a charge for all or a portion of any damage award 

there also have been several lawsuits filed against us alleging that we violated us antitrust laws several lawsuits have been filed since 2000 in us district court in oregon alleging we had monopoly power or attempted to gain monopoly power for alder logs and finished alder lumber in the pacific northwest market the alder cases in 2006 a series of lawsuits against us and other manufacturers of oriented strand board osb were consolidated into one case in the us district court in pennsylvania on behalf of purchasers of osb the lawsuit alleges that the manufacturers conspired to fix and raise osb prices and caused the purchasers of osb to pay artificially inflated prices in the event liability is found in an antitrust case the damages proved at trial are trebled jury verdicts and damages imposed against us in two of the alder cases were vacated as a result of a ruling by the us supreme court in our favor in one of the alder cases and we have settled three of these cases but one case is still pending in the osb case the us district court has issued a number of rulings approving class action status for various classes of direct and indirect purchasers for the period june 2002 through february 2006 we have not established a reserve for any of these cases and intend to contest these cases vigorously we are not able to estimate the amount of charges if any that may be required in the future 

it is possible that there could be adverse judgments against us in some or all of these cases and that we could be required to take a charge for all or a portion of any damage award any such charge could materially and adversely affect our results of operations for the quarter or year in which we record it 

currency exchange rates 

we will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates 

we have manufacturing operations in canada mexico australia uruguay and brazil and we are also a large exporter and as a result are affected by changes in currency exchange rates particularly the value of the us dollar relative to the euro and the canadian dollar 

export taxes 

we may be required to pay significant export taxes or countervailing and antidumping duties for exported products 

we may experience reduced revenues and margins on some of our businesses as a result of export taxes or countervailing and antidumping duty applications for example in 2001 a group of companies filed petitions with the us department of commerce and the international trade commission claiming that production of softwood lumber in canada was being subsidized by canada and that imports into the us from canada were being sold in us markets at less than their fair value we have softwood lumber facilities in canada that export lumber into the us we paid a total of 370 million in deposits for countervailing duty and antidumping tariffs from 2002 through 2006 related to those lumber exports the us and canadian governments reached a settlement of the dispute in 2006 as a result of the settlement we received a refund of 344 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 however our canadian softwood lumber facilities will have to pay an export tax when the price of lumber is at or below a threshold price the export tax could be as high as 225 percent if a province exceeds its total allotted export share similar types of actions have been initiated from time to time against us and other us producers of products such as paper corrugated containerboard sheets or lumber by countries such as china korea and mexico it is possible that countervailing duty and antidumping tariffs or similar types of tariffs could be imposed on us in the future we may experience reduced revenues and margins in any business that is subject to such tariffs or to the terms of the settlements of such international disputes these tariffs or settlement terms could have a material adverse effect on our business financial results and financial condition including facility closures or impairments of assets 

  

   

changes in credit ratings 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results actions that we take their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing the company on a watch list for possible future downgrading downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading would likely increase our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

natural disasters 

our business and operations could be adversely affected by weather fire infestation or natural disasters 

our timberlands assets may be damaged by adverse weather fires pest infestation or other natural disasters because our manufacturing processes primarily use wood fiber in many cases from our own timberlands in the event of material damage to our timberlands our operations could be disrupted or our production costs could be increased 

 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

stock price volatility 

the price of our common stock may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors some of which are beyond our control including those described above under “risks related to our industries and business” and the following 

 

       in addition there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in the forest products industry that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 

some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them if litigation of this type is brought against us it could result in substantial costs and would divert management’s attention and resources 

 

risks related to the domtar transaction 

on march 7 2007 we completed a transaction combining our fine paper business and related assets with domtar inc a canadian corporation to form a new company domtar corporation domtar the transaction was structured in a manner that was taxfree to us and our shareholders in connection with the transaction we entered into a taxsharing agreement with domtar that requires domtar its subsidiaries and its affiliates for a twoyear period following closing of the transaction to avoid taking certain actions that might adversely affect the taxfree status of the transaction to the extent that the taxfree status of the transaction is lost because of actions taken by domtar domtar is generally required to indemnify us for any resulting taxrelated losses incurred by us or our shareholders in the event that conduct by domtar affects the taxfree status of the transaction and domtar is unable to meet its obligation to indemnify us and our shareholders weyerhaeuser and its shareholders could incur significant tax obligations

industry shipments of boxes fell 12 percent in 2007 the containerboard industry’s operating rate was approximately 96 percent in 2007 but decreased slightly from an industry operating rate of 97 percent in 2006 the price of containerboard increased slightly due to the high operating rate and low inventories through the year 

home sales and singlefamily starts decreased 

tighter lending standards and high inventories of homes available for sale led to a sharp drop in new homes sales and singlefamily starts 

lumber structural panel and engineered wood product consumption decreased in 2007

comparing 2007 with 2006 

in 2007 

 

  net sales and revenues 

net sales and revenues decreased primarily due to continued deterioration of the us housing market declines in residential homebuilding throughout the nation have resulted in lower demand for residential building products such as softwood lumber plywood osb and engineered lumber sales of these products within our wood products segment excluding those of discontinued operations were 16 billion or 28 percent lower than 2006 these difficult market conditions also affected our real estate segment where net sales and revenues decreased 976 million or 29 percent from 2006 

the decreases in our wood products and real estate segments were partially offset by improved market conditions for core products in our containerboard packaging and recycling segment which resulted in increased net sales and revenues of 256 million

  net sales and revenues 

net sales and revenues decreased primarily due to the following

  the contribution from softwood lumber and structural panels declined 650 million – 600 million from lower average price realizations and 50 million from reduced shipment volumes 

the significant decline was offset by the following items 

 

      our outlook 

we expect no improvement in market conditions in first quarter 2008 and we expect to incur significant losses in the wood products segment we will continue to balance production to demand which may result in further production curtailments and mill closures

partially offsetting these increases was a decline in containerboard shipments of 18 percent or 190000 tons due primarily to the permanent closure of a containerboard machine in plymouth north carolina in the first quarter of 2006 

contribution to earnings 

contribution to earnings increased primarily due to the following 

 

   partially offsetting the earnings improvements above were 

 

   prices for west coast wood chips increased rapidly during the fourth quarter of 2006 due to the production curtailments at wood products manufacturing facilities caused by the slowdown in the housing market occ costs also increased rapidly at the end of 2006 as a result of strong demand from china during the fourth quarter of 2006 we decreased our operating rates to better match our production to customer demand increasing nonfiber manufacturing costs for ongoing operations 

our outlook 

we expect firstquarter earnings to decrease from fourth quarter 2007 results average packaging price realizations are expected to increase in the first quarter due to a seasonal mix improvement including an increase in produce shipments packaging shipments are expected to decline mainly due to terminating lowmargin business and seasonally lower demand on a perunit basis mill nonfiber and energy manufacturing costs are expected to decline primarily due to increased production prices for occ and wood chips are expected to increase from fourthquarter levels higher energy costs are anticipated due to seasonally higher prices and consumption prices for corn starch and wax also are expected to increase due to market pressure from the ethanol and petroleum markets 

strategic review 

on may 4 2007 we announced that our board of directors had authorized a process to consider a broad range of strategic alternatives for our containerboard packaging and recycling business alternatives range from continuing to hold and operate the assets to a possible sale or business combination as of the date of this filing this strategic review is ongoing

we continually monitor our assets for potential impairment particularly in light of the current market conditions additionally we control some land through deposits with land sellers that defer the payment of the full acquisition price until certain entitlements are obtained we also control some land through structured options offered by land sellers 

in 2007 we recorded 128 million in impairments of real estate projects and intangible assets this was a significant increase in impairments from the previous year due to the challenging market conditions for selling new homes and the inability for many home buyers to secure financing due to the changing mortgage market and tightening credit standards in 2006 we recorded 36 million in impairments of real estate projects

accounting matters 

critical accounting policies 

our critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and estimates they also have a high degree of complexity 

in accounting we base our judgments and estimates on 

 

  actual results however may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded 

our most critical accounting policies relate to our 

    details about our other significant accounting policies—what we use and how we estimate—are in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements  

pension and postretirement benefit plans 

we sponsor several pension and postretirement benefit plans for our employees key assumptions we use in accounting for the plans include our 

 

     at the end of every year we review our assumptions with external advisers and make adjustments as appropriate actual experience that differs from our assumptions or any changes in our assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results and cash flows 

other factors that affect our accounting for the plans include 

 

   this section provides more information about our 

 

     

expected longterm rate of returns 

our expected rate of return on our plan assets is 95 percent plan assets are assets of the pension plan trusts that fund the benefits provided under the pension plan 

the expected longterm rate of return is our estimate of the longterm rate of return that our plan assets will earn every year we review all available information – including returns for the last 23 years – and make the estimate accordingly the review date for our current expected rate of return was december 30 2007 

our expected rate of return is important in determining the cost of our plans every 05 percent decrease in our expected rate of return would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately 

 

  likewise every 05 percent increase in our expected rate of return would decrease expense or increase a credit by those same amounts 

discount rate 

our discount rate as of december 30 2007 is 

 

  we review our discount rates annually and revise them as needed the discount rates are selected at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of highquality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits 

our discount rate is important in determining the cost of our plans a 05 percent decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately 

 

  pension and postretirement benefit expenses for 2008 will be based on the 65 percent assumed discount rate for us plans and 55 percent for the canadian plans 

  

   

contributions made and benefits paid 

during 2007 

 

    during 2008 

 

    longlived assets and goodwill 

we review the carrying value of our longlived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations the carrying value is the amount assigned to longlived assets – including goodwill – in our books in addition we review the amount of goodwill we carry on our books in the fourth quarter of every year 

an impairment occurs when the fair market value of our goodwill drops below our carrying value or when the carrying value of longlived assets will not be recovered from future cash flows fair market value is the amount we would get if we were to sell the assets 

in determining fair market value and whether impairment has occurred we are required to estimate 

 

   key assumptions we use in developing the estimates include 

 

       

effect of acquisitions 

we have made substantial acquisitions in recent years 

the acquisitions make up a large portion of the net book value – or carrying value – of our property and equipment and timber and timberlands as a result a large portion of our longlived assets have carrying amounts that reflect relatively current values 

goodwill update 

our goodwill was 22 billion as of december 30 2007 that amount represents approximately 9 percent of our consolidated assets 

all of our reporting units passed the annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2007 during 2007 we recognized approximately 30 million of goodwill impairments in our wood products reporting units in connection with our building products distribution centers further restructuring activities protracted economic weakness or poor operating results among other factors could trigger an impairment of goodwill of the wood products reporting units in the near term as of december 30 2007 the carrying amount of goodwill for the wood products reporting units was 813 million 

legal environmental and product liability reserves 

we record contingent liabilities when 

 

  legal matters 

determining our liabilities for legal matters requires projections about the outcome of litigation and the amount of our financial responsibility we base our projections on 

 

  while we do our best in developing our projections litigation is still inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts occur details about our legal exposures and proceedings are discussed in note 16 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements  these exposures and proceedings are significant ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flow in any given quarter or year 

  

   

environmental matters 

determining our liabilities for environmental matters requires estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs we base our estimates on 

 

    product liability matters 

we record reserves for contingent product liability matters when it becomes probable we will make financial payment determining the amount of reserves we record requires projections of future claims rates and amounts the hardboard siding reserve is our sole material product liability reserve and is discussed in detail under note 16 legal proceedings commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements 

depletion 

we record depletion – the costs attributed to timber harvested – as trees are harvested 

to calculate our depletion rate which is updated annually we 

 

    

estimating the volume of timber available for harvest over the harvest cycle requires the consideration of many factors they include 

 

       in addition the length of the harvest cycle varies by geographic region and species of timber 

depletion rate calculations do not include estimates for 

 

   prospective accounting pronouncements

 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

longterm debt obligations 

the following summary of our longterm debt obligations includes 

 

   the fair value of longterm debt is estimated based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be paid using incremental rates of borrowing for similar liabilities changes in market rates of interest affect the fair value of our fixedrate debt 

summary of longterm debt obligations as of december 30 2007 

 

  

our use of derivatives 

we occasionally use derivatives to 

 

   the fair value of our derivatives may vary due to the volatility of the underlying forward prices or index rates associated with them 

  

commodity futures swaps and collars 

as of december 30 2007 we had commodity futures swaps and collars with an 

 

   the commodity swaps with notional values of 114 million were accounted for as follows 

 

  the changes in the fair market value of the commodity swaps not designated as hedges were recognized in earnings during the period in which the change occurred 

a 10 percent change in forward price levels would change the fair value of our commodity swaps by approximately 11 million that excludes any offsetting effect of price changes on underlying physical product purchases or sales

we started out as weyerhaeuser timber company incorporated in the state of washington in january 1900 when frederick weyerhaeuser and 15 partners bought 900000 acres of timberland in the 106 years since then we have worked to be the best forest products company in the world 

  

our many innovations and accomplishments through the years include 

   competition in our markets 

our major markets – both domestic and foreign – are highly competitive with numerous companies selling similar products many of our products also compete against substitutes for wood and woodfiber products in real estate development and other related activities we compete against numerous regional and national firms we compete in our markets primarily through price product quality and service levels 

  

» 1 

  

our business segments compete based on the following strategies 

      sales outside the united states 

in 2006 17 percent – or 36 billion – of our total consolidated sales and revenues were to customers outside the united states that included 

   in 2005 16 percent – or 35 billion – of our total consolidated sales and revenues were to customers outside the united states that included 

   shaping our business 

executing our strategies and building scale has meant adding to our business through key acquisitions it also has meant strategically selling or closing businesses and assets in recent years we have grown substantially through acquisitions that have included 

  our recent dispositions have included 

    in august 2006 we announced an agreement to combine our fine paper business and related assets with domtar inc “the domtar transaction” our fine paper business – part of our cellulose fiber and white papers segment – in combination with domtar inc will create a leading producer of fine paper in north america based on the production capacity of the combined assets see note 22 discontinued operations in “financial statements and supplementary data” for further details of the transaction 

we continue to reinvest in our businesses through a variety of capital projects in 2006 our capital expenditures – excluding acquisitions and our real estate and related assets business segment – totaled 849 million we expect these investments will 

   our employees 

we have approximately 46700 employees this number includes 

  of these employees approximately 16150 are members of unions covered by multiyear collective bargaining agreements 

  

 

what we do 

this section provides information about how we grow and harvest trees manufacture and sell products made from them and build and sell homes for each of our business segments we provide details about what we do where we do it how much we sell and where we are headed 

timberlands 

our timberlands business segment manages 64 million acres of private commercial forestland in the united states we own 57 million of those acres and lease the other 700000 acres in addition we have renewable longterm licenses on 268 million acres of forestland located in five canadian provinces a portion of the related assets that are part of the domtar transaction we announced in august include 122 million acres of longterm forestland licenses of which 44 million acres are located in ontario and 78 million acres located in saskatchewan financial information in the tables below includes data from all of the segment’s business units as of the end of 2006 including the assets expected to be a part of the domtar transaction 

what we do 

we grow and harvest trees for use as lumber and other wood and building products we also export logs to other countries 

  

2 « 

  

where they are made into products after harvest we typically plant seedlings to reforest the harvested areas using the most effective regeneration method for the site and species we monitor and care for the new trees as they grow to maturity we seek to sustain and maximize the timber supply from our forestlands while keeping the health of our environment a key priority we are recognized as a leading forest manager 

the goal of our timberlands businesses is to maximize returns by selling logs and stumpage to internal and external customers we focus on solid softwood and use intensive silviculture to improve forest productivity and returns while managing the forests on a sustainable basis to meet both customer and public expectations we capture additional value from our land and timber through the lease or sale of minerals oil gas recreation and communications sites sales of higherandbetteruse property and the sale of other nontimber products we realize additional value by integrating our timberlands with our manufacturing operations 

where we do it 

we own or lease 

  in addition we have renewable longterm licenses on 268 million acres of forestland located in five canadian provinces in canada forests generally are owned and administered by provincial governments 

we also coown and manage forestlands in the southern hemisphere the results of these international operations are reported in the corporate and other segment 

our worldwide timber inventory is approximately 366 million cunits one cunit equals 100 cubic feet of solid wood the amount of timber inventory does not translate into an amount of lumber or panel products because the quantity of end products 

  as a result there is no standard for converting cubic feet of solid wood into board feet of lumber or square feet of panel products 

how much we sell 

our net sales to unaffiliated customers declined 3 percent in 2006 with both 2006 and 2005 slightly exceeding 1 billion 

  

our sales volume of logs to unaffiliated customers in 2006 declined 116000 cunits or 3 percent from 2005 this reduction in volume was due primarily to the sale of the bc coastal operations in 2005 sales volumes for 2005 included 125000 cunits from these operations other factors that may affect our log sales volume include the following 

    average log price realizations in 2006 were up slightly as compared to 2005 primarily due to higher export log prices our log prices are affected by the supply of and demand for grade and fiber logs which are influenced by all of the factors described above 

sales of nonstrategic timberlands decreased slightly in 2006 as compared to 2005 in part due to the sale of the bc coastal operations in 2005 as well as the 2005 sale of leased lands in georgia that was not repeated in 2006 the leased lands in georgia represented the last parcel remaining from the 2004 sale of timberlands in georgia

  our volume of containerboard sales declined in 2006 as the result of our closure of a linerboard machine in plymouth north carolina and an increase in the amount of containerboard we consumed internally to meet the needs of our packaging customers our packaging volume increased in 2006 primarily due to the extra week of sales activity in our 53week fiscal year we achieved higher packaging sales volumes in 2006 despite the sale or closure of production at 11 packaging plants during the year we maintained our sales volume in the kraft bag market despite closing one bag facility in 2006 

the factors that affect selling prices for our containerboard packaging and recycling products and services vary

natural resource and environmental matters 

growing and harvesting timber is subject to numerous laws and government policies to protect the environment nontimber resources such as wildlife and water and other social values changes in those laws and policies can significantly affect local or regional timber harvest levels and market values of timberbased raw materials 

endangered species protections 

in the united states a number of fish and wildlife species that inhabit geographic areas near or within our timberlands have been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal endangered species act “esa” or similar state laws some of these listed species include the northern spotted owl marbled murrelet a number of salmon species bull trout and steelhead trout in the pacific northwest and the redcockaded woodpecker gopher tortoise and american burying beetle in the southeast additional species or populations may be listed as a result of pending or future citizen petitions or may be initiated by federal or state agencies 

federal and state requirements to protect habitat for threatened and endangered species have resulted in restrictions on timber harvest on some timberlands including some of our timberlands additional listings of fish and wildlife species as endangered threatened or sensitive under the esa and similar state laws as well as regulatory actions taken by federal or state agencies to protect habitat for these species may in the future result in additional restrictions on our timber harvests and other forest management practices they also could increase our operating costs and affect timber supply and prices in general 

regulations affecting forestry practices 

in the united states regulations established by the federal state and local governments or agencies to protect water quality and wetlands could affect our future harvests and forest management practices on some of our timberlands forest practice acts in some states in the united states increasingly affect present or future harvest and forest management activities for example in some states these acts limit the size of clearcuts require some timber to be left unharvested to protect water quality and fish and wildlife habitat regulate construction and maintenance of forest roads require reforestation following timber harvest and contain procedures for state agencies to review and approve proposed forest practice activities some states and some local governments regulate certain forest practices through various permit programs each state in which we own timberlands has developed best management practices to reduce the effects of forest practices on water quality and aquatic habitats additional and more stringent regulations may be adopted by various state and local governments to achieve waterquality standards under the federal clean water act protect fish and wildlife habitats or achieve other public policy objectives 

forest cer tification standards 

we operate in the united states under the sustainable forestry initiative ®  this is a certification standard designed to supplement government regulatory programs with voluntary landowner initiatives to further protect certain public resources and values the sustainable forestry initiative ® is an independent standard overseen by a governing board consisting of conservation organizations academia the forest industry and large and small forest landowners compliance with the sustainable forestry initiative ® may result in some increases in our operating costs and curtailment of our timber harvests in some areas 

what these regulations and certification programs mean to us 

the regulatory and nonregulatory forest management programs described above have increased our operating costs resulted in changes in the value of timber and logs from the our timberlands and contributed to increases in the prices paid for wood products and wood chips during periods of high demand these kinds of programs also can make it more difficult for us to respond to rapid changes in markets extreme weather or other unexpected circumstances one additional effect may be further reductions in the usage of or substitution of other products for lumber and plywood we believe that these kinds of programs have not had and in 2007 will not have a significant effect on the total harvest of timber in the united states or any major us region however these kinds of programs may have such an effect in the future we expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these programs as compared with typical owners of comparable timberlands we also expect that these programs will not significantly disrupt our planned operations over large areas or for extended periods

regulations and forest certification in canada 

our forest operations in canada are carried out on public forestlands under forest licenses all forest operations are subject to forest practices and environmental regulations and operations under licenses also are subject to contractual requirements between us and the relevant province designed to protect environmental and other social values in canada the federal species at risk act “sara” was enacted in 2002 sara enacted protective measures for species identified as being at risk and for critical habitat to date sara has not had a significant effect on our operations however it is anticipated that sara will over time result in some additional restrictions on timber harvests and other forest management practices and increase some operating costs for operators of forestlands in canada for these reasons sara is expected to affect timber supply and prices in the future 

in canada we participate in the canadian standards association sustainable forest management system standard a voluntary certification system that further protects certain public resources and values compliance with this standard will result in some increases in our operating costs and curtailment of our timber harvests in some areas in canada 

canadian aboriginal rights 

many of the canadian forestlands also are subject to the constitutionally protected treaty or commonlaw rights of the aboriginal peoples of canada most of british columbia “bc” is not covered by treaties and as a result the claims of bc’s aboriginal peoples relating to forest resources are largely unresolved although many aboriginal groups are actively engaged in treaty discussions with the governments of bc and canada final or interim resolution of claims brought by aboriginal groups is expected to result in additional restrictions on the sale or harvest of timber and may increase operating costs and affect timber supply and prices in canada we believe that such claims will not have a significant effect on our total harvest of timber or production of forest products in 2007 although they may have such an effect in the future 

pollution control regulations 

our operations also are subject to federal state and provincial and local pollution controls with regard to air water and land solid and hazardous waste management disposal and remediation laws and regulations in all areas in which we have operations we also are subject to market demands with respect to chemical content of some of our products and our use of recycled fiber compliance with these laws regulations and demands usually involves capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs we cannot easily quantify the future amounts of capital expenditures we might have to make to comply with these laws regulations and demands or the effects on our operating costs because in some instances compliance standards have not been developed or have not become final or definitive in addition when we make changes in operations to comply with regulatory standards we frequently are making changes for other purposes as well these purposes might include the extension of facility life increase in capacity changes in raw material requirements or increase in economic value of assets or products 

it is difficult to isolate the environmental component of most manufacturing capital projects but we estimate that our capital expenditures for environmental compliance were approximately 21 million in 2006 approximately 2 percent of total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and real estate and related assets based on our understanding of current regulatory requirements in the united states and canada we expect that capital expenditures for environmental compliance will be approximately 10 million in 2007 approximately 1 percent of expected total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and real estate and related assets 

environmental cleanup 

we are involved in the environmental investigation or remediation of numerous sites some of the sites are on property we presently or formerly owned on these properties we may have the sole obligation to remediate the site or may share that obligation with one or more parties other properties are owned by an unrelated party where several parties have joint and several obligations to remediate the site still other sites are superfund sites where we have been named as a potentially responsible party our liability with respect to these various sites ranges from insignificant at some sites to substantial at others the amount of liability depends on the quantity toxicity and nature of materials we deposited at the site and for some sites depends on the number and economic viability of the other responsible parties 

we spent approximately 12 million in 2006 and expect to spend approximately 10 million in 2007 on environmental remediation of these sites it is our policy to accrue for environmental remediation costs when we determine that it is probable that such an obligation exists and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the obligation we currently believe that it is reasonably possible that our costs to remediate all the identified sites may exceed our current accruals of 28 million the excess amounts required may be insignificant or could range in the aggregate up to approximately 64 million over several years this estimate of the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs is much less certain than the estimates we currently are using to determine how much to accrue the estimate of the upper range also uses assumptions less favorable to us among the range of reasonably possible outcomes 

regulation of air emissions in the united states 

the united states environmental protection agency “us epa” has promulgated regulations for air emissions from pulp and paper manufacturing facilities these regulations cover hazardous air pollutants that require use of maximum 

  

14 « 

  

achievable control technology “mact” and controls for pollutants that contribute to smog and haze the us epa has also adopted mact standards for air emissions from wood products facilities and industrial boilers we anticipate that we might spend as much as 20 million over the next few years to comply with the mact standards we cannot currently quantify the amount of capital we will need in the future to comply with new regulations being developed by the us epa or canadian environmental agencies because final rules have not been promulgated however at this time we anticipate that compliance with the new regulations will not result in capital expenditures in any year that are material in relation to our annual capital expenditures 

we recently adopted a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2020 by comparison to our emissions in 2000 assuming a comparable portfolio and regulations we intend to achieve this goal by increasing energy efficiency and by using systems that enable substitution of greenhouse gasneutral biomass fuels for highpriced fossil fuels as each of our power and recovery boilers reaches its design life span over the next 14 years we may replace the boiler with a stateoftheart system during 2006 we completed the planned replacement of one recovery boiler and completed a substantial amount of work on two additional recovery boilers as part of our budgeted capital expenditures these replacements will allow an increase in the amount of energy obtained from the biomass byproducts created in the pulping process these biomass byproducts include wood bark lignin the natural substance that binds wood fibers and other organic compounds in spent pulping liquors we also expect to be able to reduce the purchase of electric power by up to fifty percent through improvements in energy efficiency and by increasing the use of combined heat and power technology this will help to further reduce our operating costs 

regulation of air emissions in canada 

we also are actively participating in negotiations between the forest products association of canada and natural resources canada to define industry obligations for complying with canada’s national plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions over the next several years during 2006 we continued our work with international national and regional policy makers in their efforts to develop technically sound and economically viable policies practices and procedures for measuring reporting and managing greenhouse gas emissions 

potential changes in pollution regulation 

the us epa has repealed the regulations promulgated in 2000 that would have required states to develop total maximum daily load “tmdl” allocations for pollutants in water bodies determined to be waterqualityimpaired however states continue to promulgate tmdl requirements the state tmdl requirements may set limits on pollutants that may be discharged to a body of water or set additional requirements such as best management practices for nonpoint sources including timberland operations to reduce the amounts of pollutants it is not possible to estimate the capital expenditures that may be required for the company to meet pollution allocations across the various proposed state tmdl programs until a specific tmdl is promulgated

 risk factors 

 

we are subject to certain risks and events that if one or more of them occur could adversely affect our business our financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock 

you should consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information presented in this report and the matters described in “forwardlooking statements” as well as the other reports and registration statements we file from time to time with the sec in evaluating us our business and an investment in our securities 

the risks below are not the only risks that we face additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely affect our business 

risks related to our industries and business 

cyclical industries 

the industries in which we operate are highly cyclical fluctuations in the prices of and the demand for our products could result in smaller profit margins and lower sales volumes 

our businesses are highly cyclical historically economic and market shifts fluctuations in capacity and changes in foreign currency exchange rates and mortgage interest rates have created cyclical changes in prices sales volume and margins for our products the length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time and by product but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions and levels of industry capacity 

many of our products are commodities that are widely available from other producers because commodity products have few distinguishing properties from producer to producer competition for these products is based primarily on price which is determined by supply relative to demand 

the overall levels of demand for the products we manufacture and distribute and consequently our sales and profitability reflect fluctuations in levels of enduser demand which depend in part on general macroeconomic conditions in north america and worldwide and local economic conditions as well as competition from substitute products 

changes in the following are some of the factors that may adversely affect our businesses and the results of operations 

          industry supply of pulp paper packaging and wood products also is subject to fluctuation as changing industry conditions may cause producers to idle or permanently close individual machines or entire mills in addition to avoid substantial cash costs in connection with idling or closing a mill some producers choose to continue to operate at a loss which could prolong weak prices due to oversupply oversupply also may result from producers introducing new capacity in response to favorable shortterm pricing trends 

industry supply of pulp paper and containerboard also are influenced by overseas production capacity which has grown in recent years and is expected to continue to grow while the weakness of the us dollar has mitigated the levels of imports in recent years imports of pulp paper and containerboard from overseas may increase resulting in lower prices 

prices for our products are affected by many factors outside of our control and we will have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes which are often volatile because market conditions beyond our control determine the prices for our commodity products the price for any one or more of these products may fall below our cash production costs requiring us either to incur cash losses on product sales or cease production at one or more of our manufacturing facilities our profitability with respect to these products depends on managing our cost structure particularly raw material and energy costs which represent significant components of our operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control as described below if the prices of or demand for our products decline or if our raw material or energy costs increase or both our sales and profitability could be materially and adversely affected 

longterm decline in paper demand 

some of our products are vulnerable to longterm declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials 

our paper business competes with electronic transmission and document storage alternatives as well as with paper grades it does not produce such as uncoated groundwood as a result of such competition we have experienced decreased demand for some of our existing pulp and paper products as the use of these alternatives grows demand for pulp and paper products is likely to further decline our corrugated packaging business competes with nonfiber based packaging alternatives primarily plastics in several market segments changes in prices for oil petrochemicals and woodbased fiber can change the competitive position of corrugated packaging relative to alternative packaging materials and could increase the substitution of other packaging materials for corrugated packaging

changes in product mix or pricing 

our results of operation and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by changes in product mix or pricing 

our results may be affected by a change in our sales mix our outlook assumes a certain volume and product mix of sales if actual results vary from this projected volume and product mix of sales our operations and our results could be negatively affected our outlook also assumes that we will be successful in implementing previously announced price increases as well as future price increases also delays in acceptance of price increases could negatively affect our results moreover price discounting if required to maintain our competitive position could result in lower than anticipated price realizations 

intense competition 

we face intense competition in our markets and the failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we compete with north american and for many of our product lines global producers some of which may have greater financial resources and lower production costs than we do the principal basis for competition is selling price our ability to maintain satisfactory margins depends in large part on our ability to control our costs our industries are also particularly sensitive to other factors including innovation design quality and service with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line to the extent that one or more of our competitors become more successful with respect to any key competitive factor our ability to attract and retain customers could be materially adversely affected we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively and maintain current levels of sales and profitability if we are unable to compete effectively such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

availability of raw materials and energy 

our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials and energy 

we rely heavily on certain raw materials principally wood fiber and chemicals and energy sources principally natural gas electricity coal and fuel oil in our manufacturing processes our ability to increase earnings has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials and energy sources we may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material or energy costs through hedging arrangements price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs 

transportation 

we depend on third parties for transportation services and increases in cost and the availability of transportation could materially adversely affect our business and operations 

our business depends on the transportation of a large number of products both domestically and internationally we rely primarily on third parties for transportation of the products we manufacture andor distribute as well as delivery of our raw materials in particular a significant portion of the goods we manufacture and raw materials we use are transported by railroad or trucks which are highly regulated 

if any of our thirdparty transportation providers were to fail to deliver the goods we manufacture or distribute in a timely manner we may be unable to sell those products at full value or at all similarly if any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner we may be unable to manufacture our products in response to customer demand in addition if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us we may be unable to replace them at reasonable cost 

any failure of a thirdparty transportation provider to deliver raw materials or finished products in a timely manner could harm our reputation negatively impact our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation 

in addition an increase in transportation rates or fuel surcharges could materially adversely affect our sales and profitability 

material disruption of manufacturing 

a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our results of operation and financial condition 

any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

            any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products andor require us to make unplanned capital expenditures if one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired resulting in lower sales and income 

capital requirements 

our operations require substantial capital 

capital expenditures for expansion or replacement of existing facilities or equipment may be substantial although we 

  

18 « 

  

maintain our production equipment with regular periodic and scheduled maintenance we cannot assure you that key pieces of equipment in our various production processes will not need to be repaired or replaced and major equipment may need to be replaced periodically the costs of repairing or replacing such equipment and the associated downtime of the affected production line could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

based on our current operations we believe our cash flow from operations and other capital resources will be adequate to meet our operating needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements for the foreseeable future if for any reason we are unable to provide for our operating needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements on economic terms we could experience a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

environmental laws and regulations 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with violations of or liabilities under applicable environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to a wide range of general and industryspecific laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing 

         in particular the pulp and paper industry in the united states is subject to cluster rules and boiler maximum achievable control technology rules that further regulate effluent and air emissions these laws and regulations will require us to obtain authorizations from and comply with the authorization requirements of the appropriate governmental authorities which have considerable discretion over the terms and timing of permits 

we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations and as a result of remedial obligations we also could incur substantial costs such as civil or criminal fines sanctions and enforcement actions including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions cleanup and closure costs and thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations 

as the owner and operator of real estate we may be liable under environmental laws for cleanup closure and other damages resulting from the presence and release of hazardous substances on or from our properties or operations the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict and in some cases our liability may exceed forecasted amounts or the value of the property itself the discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at our sites or thirdparty sites may result in significant additional costs any material liability we incur could adversely affect our financial condition or preclude us from making capital expenditures that otherwise would benefit our business 

enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretation of these laws or regulations might require significant expenditures

 legal proceedings 

we are a party to a number of legal proceedings and adverse judgments in certain legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

the costs and other effects of pending litigation against us and related insurance recoveries cannot be determined with certainty although the disclosure in “legal proceedings” and note 16 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” contains management’s current views of the effect such litigation will have on our financial results there can be no assurance that the outcome of such proceedings will be as expected 

for example in 1999 the equity committee in the paragon trade brands inc bankruptcy proceeding sued us the lawsuit filed in the us bankruptcy court for the northern district of georgia asserted that we breached certain warranties in agreements between us and paragon relating to its public offering of common stock in february 1993 the committee was seeking to recover damages sustained by paragon in the patent infringement case brought by procter  gamble and kimberlyclark 

in june 2002 the bankruptcy court held us liable for breaches of warranty and – in the second quarter of 2005 – imposed damages of approximately 470 million we appealed the liability and damages determinations to the us district court for the northern district of georgia and we posted a bond of 500 million we believe that we will prevail on the appeal based on the information currently available to us the requirements for establishing a reserve under statement of financial accounting standards no 5 accounting for contingencies statement 5 have not been met as a result we have not established a reserve for this litigation however it is possible in the future that there could be a charge for all or a portion of any damage award any such charge could materially and adversely affect our results of operations for the quarter or the year in which we record it

lumber export taxes 

we may be required to pay significant lumber export taxes andor countervailing and antidumping duties 

we may experience reduced revenues and margins on our softwood lumber business as a result of lumber export taxes andor countervailing and antidumping duty applications 

in april 2001 the coalition for fair lumber imports the “coalition” filed two petitions with the us department of commerce the “department” and the international trade commission the “itc” claiming that production of softwood lumber in canada was being subsidized by canada and that imports from canada were being “dumped” into the us market sold at less than fair value the coalition asked that countervailing duty “cvd” and antidumping “ad” tariffs be imposed on softwood lumber imported from canada 

during the period from 2002 through october 2006 we paid a total of 370 million in deposits for cvd and ad duties 

in july 2006 the canadian and us governments announced a final settlement to this longstanding dispute the provisions of the settlement include repayment of approximately 81 percent of the deposits plus interest imposition of export measures in canada and measures to address longterm policy reform the canadian parliament voted to collect the export taxes provided for in the settlement and legislation to implement the settlement became effective in december 2006 we received 344 million in refunds in the fourth quarter of 2006 

under the settlement agreement canadian softwood lumber exporters will pay an export tax when the price of lumber is at or below a threshold price under present market conditions canadian softwood lumber exports are subject to a 15 percent export charge which may rise to 225 percent in the event a province exceeds its total allotted export share 

we may experience reduced revenues and margins in the softwood lumber business as a result of the application of the settlement agreement the settlement agreement could have a material adverse effect on our business financial results and financial condition including but not limited to facility closures or impairment of assets 

it is possible that the cvd and ad tariffs or tariffs similar to the cvd and ad tariffs may again be imposed on us in the future 

changes in credit ratings 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results actions that we take their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing the company on a watch list for possible future downgrading downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading would likely increase our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

natural disasters 

our business and operations could be adversely affected by weather fire infestation or natural disasters 

our timberlands assets may be damaged by adverse weather fires pest infestation or other natural disasters because our manufacturing processes primarily use wood fiber in many cases from our own timberlands in the event of material damage to our timberlands our operations could be disrupted or our production costs could be increased 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

stock price volatility 

the price of our common stock may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors some of which are beyond our control including those described above under “risks related to our industries and business” and the following 

       in addition there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in the forest products industry which often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 

some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them if litigation of this type is brought against us it could result in substantial costs and would divert management’s attention and resources

industry box shipments increased modestly during 2006 primarily due to moderate growth in industrial production of nondurable goods – the key driver for box demand the containerboard industry’s operating rate was approximately 98 percent – the highest in over 20 years the operating rate increased in 2006 due to increased production and some capacity closures 

home sales and singlefamily starts down 

higher interest rates contributed to a drop in both new and existing home sales in 2006 as a result the inventory of homes available for sale increased sharply causing home prices to decline – especially in areas that had been highdemand markets such as southern california phoenix las vegas and washington dc 

demand for lumber and structural panels slowed in 2006

accounting matters 

critical accounting policies 

our critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and estimates they also have a high degree of complexity 

our most critical accounting policies relate to our 

    

details about our other significant accounting policies – what we use and how we estimate – are in note 1 of “financial statements and supplementary data” 

in accounting we base our judgments and estimates on 

  actual results however may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded 

pension and postretirement benefit plans 

we sponsor several pension and postretirement benefit plans for our employees key assumptions we use in accounting for the plans include our 

      after the end of every year we review our assumptions with external advisors and make adjustments as appropriate actual experience that differs from our assumptions or any changes in our assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results and cash flows 

other factors that affect our accounting for the plans include 

   this section provides more information about our 

   expected rate of return 

our expected rate of return on our plan assets is 95 percent plan assets are investments we make to fund our pension plans 

the expected rate of return is our estimate of the longterm rate of return that our plan assets will earn every year we review all available information – including returns for the last 22 years – and make the estimate accordingly the review date for our current expected rate of return was december 31 2006 

our expected rate of return is important in determining the cost of our plans every 05 percent decrease in our expected rate of return would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately 

  likewise every 05 percent increase in our expected rate of return would decrease expense or increase a credit by those same amounts 

discount rate 

our discount rate as of december 31 2006 is 

  we review our discount rates annually and revise them as needed the discount rates are selected at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of high quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits the us plan discount rate was adjusted to reflect decreases in the benchmark rates of interest 

our discount rate is important in determining the cost of our plans every 05 percent decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately 

  pension and postretirement benefit expenses for 2007 will be based on the 58 percent assumed discount rate for us plans and 515 percent for the canadian plans 

contributions made and benefits paid 

during 2006 

  during 2007 

  longlived assets and goodwill 

we review the carrying value of our longlived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations the carrying value is the amount assigned to longlived assets – including goodwill – in our books in addition we review the amount of goodwill we carry on our books in the fourth quarter of every year 

  

» 49 

  

an impairment occurs when the fair market value of our goodwill drops below our carrying value or when the carrying value of longlived assets will not be recovered from future cash flows fair market value is the amount we would get if we were to sell the assets 

in determining fair market value and whether impairment has occurred we are required to estimate 

   key assumptions we use in developing the estimates include 

     effect of acquisitions 

we have made substantial acquisitions in recent years 

the acquisitions make up a large portion of the net book value – or carrying value – of our property and equipment and timber and timberlands as a result a large portion of our longlived assets have carrying amounts that reflect relatively current values 

goodwill update 

our goodwill was 22 billion as of december 31 2006 that amount represents approximately 8 percent of our consolidated assets 

all of our reporting units passed the annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2006 however as discussed previously during 2006 we recognized a 749 million impairment of the goodwill associated with the fine paper reporting unit in connection with our announced intent to pursue alternatives related to our fine paper operations further restructuring activities protracted economic weakness or poor operating results among other factors could trigger an impairment of goodwill of the cellulose fiber reporting unit in the near term as of december 31 2006 the carrying amount of goodwill for the cellulose fiber reporting unit was 105 million 

legal environmental and product liability reserves 

we record contingent liabilities when 

  legal matters 

determining our liabilities for legal matters requires projections about the outcome of litigation and the amount of our financial responsibility we base our projections on 

  while we do our best in developing our projections litigation is still inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts occur 

details about our legal exposures and proceedings are discussed in note 16 of “financial statements and supplementary data” these exposures and proceedings are significant ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flow in any given quarter or year 

environmental matters 

determining our liabilities for environmental matters requires estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs we base our estimates on 

    product liability matters 

hardboard siding is our main product liability matter determining the amount of reserves we record requires projections of future claims rates and amounts 

depletion 

we record depletion – the costs attributed to timber harvested – as trees are harvested 

to calculate our depletion rate which is updated annually we 

  estimating the volume of timber available for harvest over the harvest cycle requires the consideration of many factors they include 

       in addition the length of the harvest cycle varies by geographic region and species of timber 

depletion rate calculations do not include estimates for 

   prospective accounting pronouncements 

a summary of our prospective accounting pronouncements is in note 1 of “financial statements and supplementary data”

 risk factors 

  

investing in the company’s securities involves risks the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the company faces 

  

strategic review 

the company has been undertaking a strategic review of its asset portfolio facilities that do not represent a longterm strategic fit for the company or that cannot achieve topquartile performance without significant capital investments are being assessed for closure or sale the company’s strategic review has resulted in the sale and closure of several company facilities during 2005 and may result in additional dispositions or closures of company assets in 2006 the impact of these changes in the company’s asset portfolio may result in changes to future company operations that may affect the market price of the company’s securities 

  

reduction in credit rating on company debt securities 

the actions taken by the company as a result of its ongoing strategic review of its asset portfolio may affect the credit rating on the company’s debt securities credit rating agencies may from time to time change their ratings on the company’s securities as a result of the company’s operating results or actions the company takes or as a result of a change in the views of the credit rating agencies regarding among other things the general outlook for the company’s industry or the economy there can be no assurance that standard  poor’s and moody’s or other rating agencies will not reduce their ratings of the company’s securities or securities that the company may issue in the future or place any of those securities on a socalled “watch list” for possible future downgrading any of these events would likely increase the company’s costs of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of the company’s securities the credit ratings accorded to the company’s securities are not recommendations to purchase hold or sell those securities inasmuch as those ratings do not comment as to the market price or suitability for particular investors

on october 21 2005 the company announced a program to repurchase 18 million shares of its outstanding common stock see “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” the company’s repurchase of its common stock may affect the future market price of the company’s securities 

  

adverse effects on company operating results

adverse decision in paragon trade brands bankruptcy proceedings 

in 1999 the equity committee committee in the paragon trade brands inc paragon bankruptcy proceeding commenced an adversary proceeding against the company in us bankruptcy court for the northern district of georgia asserting the company breached certain warranties in agreements between paragon and the company connected with paragon’s public offering of common stock in february 1993 the committee sought to recover damages sustained by paragon in two patent infringement cases one brought by procter  gamble and the other by kimberlyclark in june 2002 the bankruptcy court held the company liable for breaches of warranty in the second quarter of 2005 the bankruptcy court imposed damages of approximately 470 million the company appealed the liability and damages determinations to the us district court for the northern district of georgia and posted a bond of 500 million the company has not established a reserve for this matter because based upon the information currently available to the company including management’s belief that an adverse result is not probable because the company will prevail on appeal management believes the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 5 accounting for contingencies statement 5 for establishing a reserve in this matter have not been met however there is no guarantee that management will not determine in the future that a charge for all or a portion 

  

  

of any damage award is required any such charge could materially and adversely affect the company’s results of operations for the quarter or the year in which such a charge may be recognized 

  

adverse verdict in alder log antitrust cases 

in december 2000 a lawsuit was filed against the company in us district court in oregon the initial alder case alleging that from 1996 to the present the company had monopoly power or attempted to gain monopoly power in the pacific northwest market for alder logs and finished alder lumber a jury verdict of trebled damages of 79 million was appealed to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit where the decision was upheld in september 2005 the company asked for discretionary review of the initial alder case by the us supreme court in november 2005 the us supreme court asked the solicitor general to express the opinions of the united states on whether to accept review 

  

in january 2005 the company received a copy of a “complaint in equity” filed in us district court in oregon to set aside the judgment in the initial alder case on behalf of a plaintiff who did not prevail in the trial it alleged a fraud was committed on the court and requested judgment against the plaintiff be vacated and a new trial set on plaintiff’s claim of monopolization of the alder sawlog market trebled damages of 20 million are alleged the us district court stayed this matter until the us supreme court takes final action in the initial alder case the company denies the allegations in the complaint and intends to vigorously defend the matter 

  

in june 2003 washington alder filed an antitrust lawsuit against the company in us district court in oregon alleging monopolization of the alder log and lumber markets and seeking trebled damages of 36 million and divestiture of the company’s northwest hardwoods division and alder sawmills in oregon washington and british columbia a jury verdict of trebled damages of 16 million was appealed to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit after oral argument in november 2005 the matter was stayed pending a final disposition by the us supreme court of the initial alder case 

  

in 2004 the company settled similar lawsuits filed against the company by five hardwood mill owners in the us district court in oregon 

  

in april 2004 a civil class action antitrust lawsuit was filed against the company in us district court in oregon claiming that as a result of the company’s alleged monopolization of the alder sawlog market in the pacific northwest as determined in the initial alder case the company monopolized the market for finished alder and charged monopoly prices for finished alder lumber in december 2004 the judge issued an order certifying the plaintiff as a class representative for all us purchasers of finished alder lumber between april 28 2000 and march 31 2004 for purposes of awarding monetary damages the company disagrees with the allegations in the lawsuit and intends to continue vigorously defending the case in february 2005 class counsel notified the court that approximately 5 percent of the class members opted out of the class action lawsuit the company has no litigation pending with any entity that has opted out of the class but it is possible that entities that have opted out may file lawsuits against the company in the future the case was stayed in the fourth quarter of 2005 pending the us supreme court entering a final opinion in the initial alder case 

  

as of december 25 2005 the company has a reserve of 95 million related to the alder cases while the company believes the reserve established for the alder antitrust litigation is adequate the company is unable to estimate what additional charges if any may be required in the future because of the uncertainties surrounding the litigation process

the following international operations are included in corporate and other 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

  

natural resource and environmental matters 

  

growing and harvesting timber is subject to numerous laws and government policies to protect the environment nontimber resources such as wildlife and water and other social values changes in those laws and policies can significantly affect local or regional timber harvest levels and market values of timberbased raw materials 

  

in the united states a number of fish and wildlife species that inhabit geographic areas near or within company timberlands have been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal endangered species act esa or similar state laws federal esa listings include the northern spotted owl marbled murrelet a number of salmon species bull trout and steelhead trout in the pacific northwest and the redcockaded woodpecker gopher tortoise and american burying beetle in the southeast listings of additional species or populations may result from pending or future citizen petitions or be initiated by federal or state agencies federal and state requirements to protect habitat for threatened and endangered species have resulted in restrictions on timber harvest on some timberlands including some timberlands of weyerhaeuser additional listings of fish and wildlife species as endangered threatened or sensitive under the esa and similar state laws as well as regulatory actions taken by federal or state agencies to protect habitat for these species may in the future result in additional restrictions on timber harvests and other forest management practices could increase operating costs and could affect timber supply and prices 

  

in the united states federal state and local regulations protecting water quality and wetlands also could affect future harvest and forest management practices on some of weyerhaeuser’s timberlands forest practice acts in some states in the united states increasingly affect present or future harvest and forest management activities for example in some states these acts limit the size of clearcuts require some timber to be left unharvested to protect water quality and fish and wildlife habitat regulate construction and maintenance of forest roads require reforestation following timber harvest and contain procedures for state agencies to review and approve proposed forest practice activities some states and some local governments regulate certain forest practices through various permit programs each state in which weyerhaeuser owns timberlands has developed best management practices to reduce the effects of forest practices on water quality and aquatic habitats additional and more stringent regulations may be adopted by various state and local governments to achieve waterquality standards under the federal clean water act protect fish and wildlife habitats or achieve other public policy objectives 

  

weyerhaeuser operates under the sustainable forestry initiative ®  a certification standard designed to supplement government regulatory programs with voluntary landowner initiatives to further protect certain public resources and values the sustainable forestry initiative ® is an independent standard overseen by a governing board consisting of conservation organizations academia the forest industry and large and small forest landowners compliance with the sustainable forestry initiative ® may result in some increases in operating costs and curtailment of timber harvests in some areas 

  

the regulatory and nonregulatory forest management programs described above have increased operating costs resulted in changes in the value of timber and logs from the company’s timberlands and contributed to increases in the prices paid for wood products and wood chips during periods of high demand these kinds of programs can also make it more difficult to respond to rapid changes in markets extreme weather or other unexpected circumstances one additional effect may be further reductions in usage of and some substitution of other products for lumber and plywood weyerhaeuser does not believe that these kinds of programs have had or in 2006 will have a significant effect on the company’s total harvest of timber in the united states or any major us region although they may have such an effect in the future further weyerhaeuser does not expect to be disproportionately affected by these programs as compared with typical owners of comparable timberlands likewise management expects that these programs will not significantly disrupt weyerhaeuser’s planned operations over large areas or for extended periods 

  

weyerhaeuser’s forest operations in canada are carried out on public forestlands under forest licenses all forest operations are subject to forest practices and environmental regulations and operations under licenses also are subject to contractual requirements between the company and the relevant province designed to protect environmental and other social values in canada the federal species at risk act sara was enacted in 2002 sara enacted protective measures for species identified as being at risk and for critical habitat to date sara has not had a significant effect on weyerhaeuser’s operations however it is anticipated that sara will over time result in some additional restrictions on timber harvests and other forest management practices and increase some operating costs for operators of forestlands in canada for these reasons sara is expected to affect timber supply and prices in the future 

  

  

weyerhaeuser participates in the canadian standards association sustainable forest management system standard a voluntary certification system that further protects certain public resources and values compliance with this standard will result in some increases in operating costs and curtailment of timber harvests in some areas in canada 

  

many of the canadian forestlands also are subject to the constitutionally protected treaty or commonlaw rights of the aboriginal peoples of canada most of bc is not covered by treaties and as a result the claims of bc’s aboriginal peoples relating to forest resources are largely unresolved although many aboriginal groups are actively engaged in treaty discussions with the governments of bc and canada final or interim resolution of claims brought by aboriginal groups are expected to result in additional restrictions on the sale or harvest of timber and may increase operating costs and affect timber supply and prices in canada the company believes that such claims will not have a significant effect on weyerhaeuser’s total harvest of timber or production of forest products in 2006 although they may have such an effect in the future 

  

the company also is subject to federal state and provincial and local pollution controls with regard to air water and land solid and hazardous waste management disposal and remediation laws and regulations in all areas in which it has operations as well as market demands with respect to chemical content of some products and use of recycled fiber compliance with these laws regulations and demands usually involves capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs the company cannot easily quantify future amounts of capital expenditures required to comply with these laws regulations and demands or the effects on operating costs because in some instances compliance standards have not been developed or have not become final or definitive in addition compliance with standards frequently serves other purposes such as extension of facility life increase in capacity changes in raw material requirements or increase in economic value of assets or products while it is difficult to isolate the environmental component of most manufacturing capital projects weyerhaeuser estimates that capital expenditures for environmental compliance were approximately 31 million in 2005 4 percent of total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and real estate and related assets based on its understanding of current regulatory requirements in the united states and canada weyerhaeuser expects that capital expenditures for environmental compliance will be approximately 42 million in 2006 5 percent of expected total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and real estate and related assets 

  

weyerhaeuser is involved in the environmental investigation or remediation of numerous sites some of the sites are on property presently or formerly owned by the company where the company has the sole obligation to remediate the site or shares that obligation with one or more parties others are thirdparty sites involving several parties who have a joint and several obligation to remediate the site and some are superfund sites where the company has been named as a potentially responsible party the company’s liability with respect to these sites ranges from insignificant at some sites to substantial at others depending on the quantity toxicity and nature of materials deposited by the company at the site and with respect to some sites the number and economic viability of the other responsible parties 

  

the company spent approximately 14 million in 2005 and expects to spend approximately 14 million in 2006 on environmental remediation of these sites it is the company’s policy to accrue for environmental remediation costs when it is determined that it is probable that such an obligation exists and the amount of the obligation can be reasonably estimated based on currently available information the company believes that it is reasonably possible that costs associated with all identified sites may exceed current accruals of 29 million by amounts that may prove insignificant or that could range in the aggregate up to approximately 70 million over several years this estimate of the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs is much less certain than the estimates upon which accruals are currently based and uses assumptions less favorable to the company among the range of reasonably possible outcomes 

  

the united states environmental protection agency us epa has promulgated regulations dealing with air emissions from pulp and paper manufacturing facilities including regulations on hazardous air pollutants that require use of maximum achievable control technology mact and controls for pollutants that contribute to smog and haze the us epa has also adopted mact standards for air emissions from wood products facilities and industrial boilers the company anticipates that it might spend as much as 30 million over the next few years to comply with the mact standards the company cannot quantify future capital requirements needed to comply with new regulations being developed by the us epa or canadian environmental agencies because final rules have not been promulgated however at this time the company anticipates that compliance with the new regulations will not result in capital expenditures in any year that are material in relation to the company’s annual capital expenditures 

  

  

the american forest  paper association has made a commitment on behalf of all association members of the association to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 2012 the company also is actively participating in negotiations between the forest products association of canada and natural resources canada to define industry obligations for complying with canada’s national plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions over the next several years the company cannot estimate what expenditures may ultimately be required to contribute to these commitments but does not expect significant expenditures in 2006 during 2005 the company continued its work with international national and regional policy makers in their efforts to develop technically sound and economically viable policies practices and procedures for measuring reporting and managing greenhouse gas emissions 

  

the us epa has repealed the regulations promulgated in 2000 that would have required states to develop total maximum daily load tmdl allocations for pollutants in water bodies determined to be waterqualityimpaired however states continue to promulgate tmdl requirements the state tmdl requirements may set limits on pollutants that may be discharged to a body of water or set additional requirements such as best management practices for nonpoint sources including timberland operations to reduce the amounts of pollutants it is not possible to estimate the capital expenditures that may be required for the company to meet pollution allocations across the various proposed state tmdl programs until a specific tmdl is promulgated

 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

  

  

economic and industry factors affecting operations 

  

historically the company’s operating results have been affected by a variety of market conditions that influence demand and pricing for the company’s products certain factors such as the health of the economy and the strength of the us dollar are cyclical in nature the global economy which affects the demand for a number of the company’s products continued to grow at a healthy pace in 2005 despite a large and growing trade deficit the us dollar appreciated through much of the year a stronger us dollar makes it more difficult for us manufactured goods to compete with international suppliers other factors such as the surge in containerboard capacity in asia and a trend toward electronic substitution for paper may represent fundamental changes in the marketplace for the company’s products finally higher energy prices and increased transportation costs due in part to hurricanes katrina and rita resulted in lower profit margins for many of the company’s operations in 2005 

  

market pulp demand growth slowed in 2005 consistent with little growth in printing and writing paper production in north america europe and japan industry pulp prices were relatively flat compared to 2004 approximately 35 percent of the company’s pulp production is based in canada as a result the appreciation of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar adversely affected the competitiveness of these mills 

  

uncoated free sheet ucfs demand in north america fell approximately 4 percent in 2005 ucfs use continues to be negatively affected by the substitution of electronic technologies and competition from other paper grades in commercial printing on average industry ucfs prices were up in 2005 versus 2004 but margins were eroded by higher production costs especially energy the challenging situation led several north american companies including weyerhaeuser to announce plant closures in 2005 

  

industry box shipments increased slightly in 2005 growth in industrial production of nondurable goods the primary factor affecting demand for boxes slowed in 2005 due to the stronger us dollar which eroded the competitive position of us manufacturing because the industry’s containerboard capacity has been decreasing for several years the industry’s operating rate remained near 95 percent thus despite slow growth in demand average industry prices for 2005 were near 2004 levels 

  

housing sales and starts increased in 2005 due to an economic and interest rate environment that continued to be favorable the company’s real estate business operates in some of the stronger housing markets in the united states such as southern california las vegas and the washington dc area both the number of singlefamily home sales closed and the average selling price realized by the company’s real estate business increased in 2005 

  

as a result of the strong housing market and remodeling activity north american demand for lumber and structural panel products remained very high in 2005 the growth in manufacturing capacity especially for lumber coupled with improvements in rail transportation resulted in downward pressure on product prices in 2005 compared to 2004 levels 

  

the company’s canadian lumber and osb operations were negatively affected by the strong canadian dollar relative to the us dollar the uscanadian lumber trade dispute has not been resolved duties continued in 2005 for canadian companies selling lumber into the united states however antidumping duties paid by the company decreased in 2005 partially due to lower sales resulting from the divestiture of the bc coastal operations the ongoing nature of the dispute and the multiple venues at which the cases are being heard leave uncertain the fate of the accumulated deposits 

  

the timberlands business was positively affected by the strength in wood products production western timber prices benefited from strong lumber demand in the western us markets and steady demand for log exports to japan southern timber prices benefited from tight supply conditions caused by weather and marketrelated factors

interest expense 

interest expense incurred by weyerhaeuser was 739 million 838 million and 815 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively interest expense incurred in 2005 included 45 million of interest incurred by special purpose entities the company has consolidated see note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements in “financial statements and supplementary data” below interest expense incurred also included pretax charges of 35 million recognized in the third and fourth quarters of 2005 and 73 million recognized in the second and fourth quarters of 2004 in connection with the early extinguishment of debt excluding the interest expense of the special purpose entities and excluding the losses on early extinguishment of debt interest expense decreased 106 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 and decreased 50 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 the decrease in interest expense is principally the result of a net reduction in debt of approximately 20 billion in 2005 and approximately 19 billion in 2004 

  

  

interest expense incurred in the real estate and related assets segment is fully capitalized to qualifying assets under development as disclosed in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements in “financial statements and supplementary data” below the company made a change in the fourth quarter of 2005 to begin capitalizing weyerhaeuser interest on qualifying assets of real estate and related assets the change would have increased weyerhaeuser capitalized interest 50 million weyerhaeuser cost of sales 32 million and quarterly net earnings 2 million to 4 million per quarter in 2005 if the company had followed this accounting practice for all of 2005 future activity will be dependent on the level of qualifying real estate assets and debt held by real estate and related assets and the timing and volume of sales of qualifying real estate assets 

  

income taxes

during the second quarter of 2005 the company recognized a 46 million income tax benefit in connection with the sale of the company’s bc coastal operations see note 23 of notes to consolidated financial statements in “financial statements and supplementary data” below the income tax benefit recognized upon the sale of the bc coastal operations included a deferred tax benefit of 185 million resulting from the rollout of temporary differences on the assets sold and a current tax expense of 139 million on the taxable gain current taxes reflect the benefit of favorable capital gains treatment applicable to the sale of timberlands in canada also during the second quarter of 2005 the company recognized a charge of 44 million for the accrual of income taxes associated with the repatriation of approximately 11 billion of foreign earnings see note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements in “financial statements and supplementary data” below 

  

under current tax law the ability to use tax credits from the production of nonconventional fuel would be phased out ratably if the average annual domestic wellhead price published by the department of energy doe is 51 to 64 per barrel in 2004 dollars and would be fully phased out if the top end of the price range is reached based on current domestic wellhead prices the company expects to be in the phase out range for 2006 total phase out would result in a loss of 24 million in tax credits from the production of nonconventional fuel in 2006 the company’s ability to use these credits was not limited in 2005

environmental matters legal proceedings and other contingencies 

  

hardboard siding claims 

the company announced in june 2000 it had entered into a proposed nationwide settlement of class action suits relating to sales of hardboard siding and as a result took a pretax charge of 130 million to cover the estimated cost of the settlement and related claims the court approved the settlement in december 2000 an appeal of the settlement was denied in march 2002 and the settlement is now binding on all parties 

  

the company reassessed the adequacy of these reserves and increased its reserves by an additional 43 million during 2001 claims and related costs in the amount of 5 million in 2005 7 million in 2004 and 11 million in 2003 were paid against the reserve in the third quarter of 2004 an adjustment was made to reduce the reserve by 20 million based upon a review of the activities and trends over the preceding four years 

  

the company has negotiated settlements with its insurance carriers for recovery of certain costs related to these claims as of the end of 2005 the company had received payments from insurance carriers in the amount of 52 million for further discussion regarding this matter including claims data see note 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements in “financial statements and supplementary data” below

accounting matters 

  

critical accounting policies 

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements in “financial statements and supplementary data” below the company’s critical accounting policies are those that may involve a higher degree of judgment estimates and complexity the company believes its most critical accounting policies include those related to the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans potential impairments of longlived assets and goodwill reserves for matters such as legal and environmental issues and product liability reserves and depletion accounting while the company bases its judgments and estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that management believes are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts 

  

pension and postretirement benefit plans the company sponsors several pension and postretirement benefit plans for its employees key assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded in the company’s financial statements include the discount rate the expected return on plan assets anticipated trends in health care costs assumed increases in salaries mortality rates and other factors these assumptions are reviewed with external advisors at the end of each fiscal year and are updated as appropriate actual experience that differs from the assumptions could have a significant effect on the company’s financial position results from operations or cash flows other factors that affect the level of net periodic benefit income or expense that is recognized in a given year include actual pension fund performance plan changes and changes in plan participation or coverage 

  

the company’s expected rate of return on plan assets reflects the company’s best estimate regarding the longterm rate of return on plan assets based on the information that was available as of the measurement date including historical returns for the last 20 years as of december 25 2005 the company is using an expected rate of return on pension plan assets assumption of 95 percent this assumption which will be used in the determination of the 2006 net periodic benefits costs is the same assumption that was used for 2005 and 2004 each 05 percent reduction in the expected return on plan assets would increase the 2006 pension plan expense by approximately 20 million for the company’s us qualified pension plans and by approximately 5 million for the company’s canadian registered pension plans 

  

the discount rate for both the us and canadian plans is based on yields for corporate bonds rated aa or better by matching cash flows to a spot rate yield curve as of december 25 2005 the company reduced the discount rate from 600 percent to 590 percent for the us plans and from 600 percent to 515 percent for the canadian plans to reflect decreases in the benchmark rates of interest pension and postretirement benefit expenses for 2006 will be based on the 590 percent assumed discount rate for us plans and 515 percent for the canadian plans future discount rates may differ each 05 percent reduction in the assumed discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately 19 million for the company’s us qualified pension plans and by approximately 8 million for the company’s canadian registered pension plans 

  

the company had no obligation to and did not make any contributions to its us qualified pension plans during 2005 benefits of approximately 16 million for the us nonqualified plan were paid from general assets of the company as this plan is not prefunded the company contributed approximately 46 million to its registered and nonregistered canadian pension plans in 2005 the company expects it will not have an obligation to make contributions to its us plans during 2006 and expects to contribute a total of approximately 47 million to its canadian plans during 2006 

  

longlived assets and goodwill the company reviews the carrying value of its longlived assets and goodwill when events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations in addition goodwill is assessed annually in the fourth quarter for impairment in order to determine whether longlived assets and goodwill are impaired and the amount and timing of impairment charges the company is required to estimate future cash flows residual values and fair values of the related assets key assumptions used in those calculations include the probability of alternative outcomes product pricing raw material costs volumes 

  

  

of product to be sold and discount rates management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable however changes in estimates of such cash flows changes in the likelihood of alternative outcomes and changes in estimates of fair value could affect the evaluations 

  

the company has grown substantially through acquisitions in recent years a large portion of the net book value of the company’s property and equipment and timber and timberlands represent amounts allocated to those assets as part of the allocation of the purchase price of recent acquisitions due to these allocations a large portion of the company’s longterm assets are valued at relatively current amounts in addition the company had goodwill of 30 billion as of december 25 2005 which represented approximately 11 percent of the company’s consolidated assets 

  

all of the company’s reporting units passed the goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2005 as disclosed above under “economic and industry factors affecting operations” a trend towards electronic substitution for paper may represent a fundamental change in the marketplace for the company’s paper products cellulose fiber and white papers lost 444 million in 2005 including pretax charges for closure of facilities of 449 million further restructuring activities protracted economic weakness or poor operating results among other factors could trigger an impairment of cellulose fiber and white papers’ goodwill in the near term as of december 25 2005 the carrying amount of goodwill for the cellulose fiber and white papers segment was 857 million 

  

legal environmental and product liability reserves contingent liabilities principally for legal environmental and product liability matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical experience and recommendations of legal counsel however litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur as disclosed in note 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements in “financial statements and supplementary data” below the company’s legal exposures are significant and the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings could be material to operating results or cash flows in any given quarter or year 

  

liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs the company determines these estimates after a detailed evaluation of each site in establishing its accruals for environmental remediation the company has assumed that it will not bear the entire cost of remediation of every site to the exclusion of other known potentially responsible parties who may be jointly and severally liable the ability of other potentially responsible parties to participate has been taken into account based generally on each party’s financial condition and probable contribution on a persite basis the company does not record amounts for recoveries from insurance carriers until a binding agreement has been reached between the company and the carrier 

  

additionally reserves for future claims settlements relating to hardboard siding cases require judgments regarding projections of future claims rates and amounts 

  

depletion depletion or costs attributed to timber harvested is recorded as trees are harvested depletion rates are adjusted annually depletion rates are computed by dividing the original cost of the timber less previously recorded depletion by the total timber volume that is estimated to be harvested over the harvest cycle the length of the harvest cycle varies by geographic region and species of timber the depletion rate calculations do not include an estimate for future silviculture costs associated with existing stands future reforestation costs associated with a stand’s final harvest or future volume in connection with the replanting of a stand subsequent to its final harvest 

  

significant estimates and judgments are required to determine the volume of timber available for harvest over the harvest cycle some of the factors affecting the estimates are changes in weather patterns the effect of fertilizer and pesticide applications changes in environmental regulations and restrictions that may limit the company’s ability to harvest certain timberlands changes in harvest plans the scientific advancement in seedling and growing technology and changes in harvest cycles 

  

prospective pronouncements 

see note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements in “financial statements and supplementary data” below for a summary of prospective accounting pronouncements 

  

  

forwardlooking statements 

  

some information included in this report contains statements concerning the company’s future results and performance that are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 some of these forwardlooking statements can be identified by the use of forwardlooking terminology such as “expects” “may” “will” “believes” “should” “approximately” “anticipates” “estimates” and “plans” and the negative or other variations of those terms or comparable terminology or by discussions of strategy plans or intentions in particular some of these forwardlooking statements deal with expectations regarding the company’s markets in the first quarter of 2006 expected earnings and performance of the company’s business segments during the first quarter of 2006 demand and pricing for the company’s products in the first quarter of 2006 expected raw material energy chemical transportation and manufacturing costs in the first quarter of 2006 expected capital expenditures in 2006 facility closings and related charges new home sales and closings effect of canadian exchange rate the effect of adverse litigation outcomes and the adequacy of reserves the effect of regulations the effect of changes in accounting principles contributions to pension plans projected benefit payments projected tax rates and expected loss of tax credits and related matters the accuracy of such statements is subject to a number of risks uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected including but not limited to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the company is also a large exporter and is affected by changes in economic activity in europe and asia particularly japan and by changes in currency exchange rates particularly the relative value of the us dollar to the euro and the canadian dollar and restrictions on international trade or tariffs imposed on imports including the countervailing and antidumping duties imposed on the company’s softwood lumber shipments from canada to the united states these and other factors could cause or contribute to actual results differing materially from such forwardlooking statements and accordingly no assurances can be given that any of the events anticipated by the forwardlooking statements will occur or if any of them occurs what effect they will have on the company’s results of operations or financial condition the company expressly declines any obligation to publicly revise any forwardlooking statements that have been made to reflect the occurrence of events after the date of this report 

  

  

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

the fair value of the company’s fixedrate debt is affected by changes in market rates of interest a summary of the company’s longterm debt obligations including scheduled principal repayments and weighted average interest rates as of december 25 2005 follows 

  

   

occasionally the company uses derivative instruments to achieve a desired mix of fixed versus floating rate debt in its capital structure to hedge commitments for short or long positions in commodities the company produces or purchases to manage exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and to eliminate or create other exposures to investments or liability commitments that are less efficiently managed in the cash or physical markets the fair value of derivative contracts may vary due to the volatility of the expected underlying forward prices or index rates associated with such contracts 

  

as of december 25 2005 the company had commodity futures swaps and collars with an annual notional value of 252 million an aggregate notional value of 308 million and an aggregate fair value of approximately 56 million as of december 25 2005 commodity swaps with a notional value of 201 million were accounted for as cash flow hedges and the remaining commodity swaps with a notional value of approximately 107 million were marked to market and changes in fair market value were recognized in earnings in the period of change a 10 percent change in the forward price levels would result in a change in the fair value of the commodity contracts of up to approximately 31 million this sensitivity excludes the offsetting impact of the price changes on underlying physical product purchases or sales and excludes any sensitivity reduction due to negative andor low correlations between commodities 

  

the company had an investment swap with a notional value of 126 million and a fair value of approximately 1 million at december 25 2005 the value at risk for this derivative is approximately 6 million calculated by applying conservative probabilities of changes in the expected return based on historical results 

  

as of december 25 2005 entities that the company has consolidated under financial accounting standards board interpretation no 46 revised had interest swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of 34 million and a fair value representing a loss of less than 1 million

accounting pronouncements implemented the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations statement 143 as of the beginning of 2003 statement 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the longlived asset the cumulative effect of adopting the accounting principle after a tax benefit of 6 million was a charge of 11 million or 5 cents per share basic and diluted 

  

  

the adoption of the following recent accounting pronouncements did not have a material effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

  

   

   

prospective accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment statement 123r  in december 2004 statement 123r is a revision of statement of financial accounting standards no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees statement 123  statement 123r requires the fair value of employee awards issued modified repurchased or cancelled after implementation under sharebased payment arrangements to be measured as of the grant dates the resulting cost will then be recognized in the statement of earnings over the service period the company will implement statement 123r as of the beginning of fiscal year 2006 as permitted by a securities and exchange commission rule that was issued in april 2005 the company is currently evaluating the effect that statement 123r will have on its financial position results of operations or cash flows when statement 123r is adopted 

  

the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 151 inventory costs – an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4 statement 151 in november 2004 statement 151 amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin arb no 43 chapter 4 inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material spoilage among other provisions the new rule requires that items such as idle facility expense excessive spoilage double freight and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of “so abnormal” as stated in arb no 43 additionally statement 151 requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversions be based on normal capacity of the production facilities statement 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 and is required to be adopted by the company in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 the company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of statement 151 will have on its financial position and results of operations but does not expect it to be material 

  

use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

financial instruments the company has where appropriate estimated the fair value of financial instruments these fair value amounts may be significantly affected by the assumptions used including the discount rate and estimates of cash flows accordingly the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current market exchange where these estimates approximate carrying value no separate disclosure of fair value is shown 

  

derivatives the company uses welldefined financial contracts in the normal course of its operations as a means to manage its foreign exchange interest rate and commodity price risks the company also uses other contracts that either do not provide for net settlement or are fixedprice contracts for future purchases and sales of various commodities for which the company applies the “normal purchases or normal sales” exclusion for accounting purposes 

  

the effective portions of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges and of the hedged items attributable to the hedged risks are recognized in earnings changes in the fair value of all other derivative instruments not accounted for as hedges are also recognized in earnings in the period in which the changes occur 

  

  

certain commodity contracts primarily related to the purchase of energy have been designated as cash flow hedges in addition entities that operate mills on a contract basis for the company and that the company has consolidated under fasb interpretation no 46 revised december 2003 consolidation of variable interest entities  have variabletofixed interest rate swap agreements entered into with a bank in which the entities pay fixed rates and receive floating rates with the interest payments calculated on a notional amount the interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as cash flow hedges by the consolidated entities and changes in the fair value of these swaps are recorded in minority interest 

  

in addition the company has the following contracts that are not being accounted for as hedges 

  

   

   

the company is exposed to creditrelated gains or losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instruments but does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations the annual notional amounts of the company’s derivative financial instruments were 418 million and 387 million at december 25 2005 and december 26 2004 respectively the aggregate notional amounts of these derivative financial instruments were 474 million and 486 million at december 25 2005 and december 26 2004 respectively these notional amounts do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and thus are not a measure of exposure to the company through its use of derivatives the exposure in a derivative contract is the net difference between what each party is required to pay based on contractual terms the company’s use of derivative instruments resulted in gains of approximately 22 million in 2005 12 million in 2004 and 8 million in 2003 

  

cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments with original maturities of 90 days or less are considered cash equivalents shortterm investments are stated at amortized cost which approximates market 

  

inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost includes labor materials and production overhead the lastin firstout lifo method is used to cost more than half of domestic raw materials in process and finished goods inventories lifo inventories were 669 million and 670 million at december 25 2005 and december 26 2004 respectively the balance of domestic raw material and product inventories all materials and supplies inventories and all foreign inventories is costed at either the firstin firstout fifo or moving average cost methods had the fifo method been used to cost all inventories the amounts at which product inventories are stated would have been 240 million and 203 million greater at december 25 2005 and december 26 2004 respectively 

  

property and equipment the company’s property accounts are maintained on an individual asset basis improvements to and replacements of major units are capitalized maintenance repairs and minor replacements are expensed depreciation is provided on the straightline method at rates based on estimated service lives amortization of logging railroads and truck roads is provided generally as timber is harvested and is based upon rates determined with reference to the volume of timber estimated to be removed over such facilities

description of investment policies and strategies 

  

qualified and registered plans the strategy of the us pension trust is to invest directly and via total return partnership swaps in a diversified mix of nontraditional strategies including hedge funds private equity opportunistic real estate and other externally managed alternative investment funds equity index and fixed income derivative instruments are used to supplement the market exposures embedded in such investments these additional financial instruments constitute indirect investments held by the us pension trust that serve to increase the return and risk profile of the investment portfolio the overall return earned by the pension trust is the aggregate of returns earned on direct investments and returns earned on the derivatives the canadian pension trust has a similar investment strategy however it concentrates direct investments into cash and cash equivalents while gaining return exposures through financial instruments such as total return and index swaps the company has not established target allocations for the direct investment portfolio or the derivatives 

  

the qualified and registered plans are exposed to the risk of nonperformance by counterparties to the indirect investments but the company does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations however because there are no exchanges of principal on the indirect investments only the amount of unsettled net receivables is at risk the company manages this risk through selection of counterparties with a defined minimum credit quality diversification settlement provisions and documented agreements investments in hedge funds and private partnerships are controlled through selection and diversification of managers and strategies and use of limited liability vehicles portfolio risk is managed through diversification and by constraining the risk profile of the portfolio within defined boundaries 

  

nonregistered plans the canadian nonregistered plans are funded using retirement compensation arrangements rcas under canadian tax rules 50 percent of any contribution to an rca goes to a noninterestbearing refundable tax account held by the government this means that on average over time it is expected that approximately 50 percent of the plans’ assets are not invested the invested portion of the plans’ assets consists of a portfolio of equities 

  

retiree life insurance the plan is funded by a premium deposit fund pdf held by the insurance carrier the fund is used to pay premiums for current retirees covered under the us retiree life insurance plan for salaried employees the company’s intent is to pay these premiums from the fund and to make no future contributions to the fund it is expected that the fund will be fully drawn down in the next fiscal year or shortly thereafter

in march 2004 la cie mccormick canada company filed a class action lawsuit in superior court of justice in ontario canada against the company and other linerboard manufacturers on behalf of all canadians who purchased corrugated products including sheets and containers andor linerboard during the period of time from 1993 to at least the end of 1995 the allegations mirror the allegations in the us cases general damages of 25 million and 10 million in punitive damages are sought at this stage the company cannot calculate what portion of the damages requested would be argued as the company’s responsibility canadian law does not provide for a trebling of antitrust damages the company has not recorded a reserve for the matter and does not expect any future charges that may be taken for this matter to have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations cash flows or financial position 

  

alder antitrust litigation in december 2000 a lawsuit was filed against the company in us district court in oregon the initial alder case alleging from 1996 to the present the company had monopoly power or attempted to gain monopoly power in the pacific northwest market for alder logs and finished alder lumber a jury verdict of trebled damages of 79 million was appealed to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit where the decision was upheld in september 2005 the company asked for discretionary review of the initial alder case by the us supreme court in november 2005 the us supreme court asked the solicitor general to express the opinions of the united states on whether to accept review 

  

  

in january 2005 the company received a copy of a “complaint in equity” filed in us district court in oregon to set aside the judgment in the initial alder case on behalf of a plaintiff who did not prevail in the trial it alleged a fraud was committed on the court and requested judgment against the plaintiff be vacated and a new trial set on plaintiff’s claim of monopolization of the alder sawlog market trebled damages of 20 million are alleged the us district court stayed this matter until the us supreme court takes final action in the initial alder case the company denies the allegations in the complaint and intends to vigorously defend the matter 

  

in june 2003 washington alder filed an antitrust lawsuit against the company in us district court in oregon alleging monopolization of the alder log and lumber markets and seeking trebled damages of 36 million and divestiture of the company’s northwest hardwoods division and alder sawmills in oregon washington and british columbia a jury verdict of trebled damages of 16 million was appealed to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit after oral argument in november 2005 the matter was stayed pending a final disposition by the us supreme court of the initial alder case 

  

in 2004 the company settled similar lawsuits filed against the company by five hardwood mill owners in the us district court in oregon 

  

in april 2004 a civil class action antitrust lawsuit was filed against the company in us district court in oregon claiming that as a result of the company’s alleged monopolization of the alder sawlog market in the pacific northwest as determined in the initial alder case the company monopolized the market for finished alder and charged monopoly prices for finished alder lumber in december 2004 the judge issued an order certifying the plaintiff as a class representative for all us purchasers of finished alder lumber between april 28 2000 and march 31 2004 for purposes of awarding monetary damages the company denies the allegations in the complaint and intends to vigorously defend the matter in february 2005 class counsel notified the court that approximately 5 percent of the class members opted out of the class action lawsuit the company has no litigation pending with any entity that has opted out of the class but it is possible that entities who have opted out may file lawsuits against the company in the future the case was stayed in the fourth quarter of 2005 pending the us supreme court entering a final opinion in the initial alder case 

  

changes in the amount accrued for alder antitrust litigation matters follows 

  

   

while the company believes the reserve established for the alder antitrust litigation is adequate the company is unable to estimate what additional charges if any may be required in the future because of the uncertainties surrounding the litigation process 

  

paragon trade brands inc litigation in 1999 the equity committee committee in the paragon trade brands inc paragon bankruptcy proceeding commenced an adversary proceeding against the company in us bankruptcy court for the northern district of georgia asserting the company breached certain warranties in agreements between paragon and the company connected with paragon’s public offering of common stock in february 1993 the committee sought to recover damages sustained by paragon in two patent infringement cases one brought by procter  gamble and the other by kimberlyclark in june 2002 the bankruptcy court held the company liable for breaches of warranty in the second quarter of 2005 the bankruptcy court imposed damages of approximately 470 million the company appealed the liability and damages determinations to the us district court for the northern district of georgia and posted a bond of 500 million the company has not established a reserve for this matter because based upon the information currently available to the company including management’s belief that an adverse result is not probable because the company will prevail on appeal management believes the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 5 accounting for contingencies statement 5 for establishing a reserve in this matter have not been 

  

  

met however there is no guarantee that management will not determine in the future that a charge for all or a portion of any damage award is required any such charge could materially and adversely affect the company’s results of operations for the quarter or the year in which such a charge may be recognized 

  

other litigation the company is party to other matters generally incidental to its business in addition to the matters described above 

  

summary although the final outcome of any legal proceeding is subject to a great many variables and cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty management currently believes that adequate reserves have been established for probable losses from litigation when the amounts could be reasonably determined management further believes that the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings could materially adversely affect results of operations cash flows or financial condition in any given quarter or year but will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s longterm results of operations cash flows or financial position 

  

countervailing and antidumping duties 

  

softwood lumber imported into the united states from canada 

in april 2001 the coalition for fair lumber imports coalition filed two petitions with the us department of commerce department and the international trade commission itc claiming that production of softwood lumber in canada was being subsidized by canada and that imports from canada were being “dumped” into the us market sold at less than fair value the coalition asked that countervailing duty cvd and antidumping ad tariffs be imposed on softwood lumber imported from canada 

  

in march 2002 the department confirmed its preliminary finding that certain canadian provinces were subsidizing logs by failing to collect full market price for stumpage the department established a final cvd rate of 1879 percent in the ad proceedings the department found that the six canadian manufacturers examined including the company were engaged in sales at less than fair value and set cash deposit rates ranging from 218 percent to 1244 percent the company’s deposit rate was set at 1239 percent because of statutory limitations that affected timing the bonds covering duties following the preliminary determinations were released by the united states the resulting reversal of accrued expenses was included in earnings during 2002 

  

in may 2002 the itc confirmed its earlier ruling that us industry is threatened by subsidized and dumped imports and the company began making cash deposits relating to the cvd and ad actions in june 2003 the department began the process of the annual reviews to determine the final duty rates under both cvd and ad for annual periods commencing with the period from may 22 2002 through march 31 2003 for cvd and through april 30 2003 for ad the annual review process will be conducted covering successive oneyear periods for five years in 2007 both the cvd duty and ad orders will be automatically reviewed in a “sunset” proceeding to determine whether dumping will continue or a countervailing subsidy is likely to recur if the relevant order were to be revoked as a result of administrative determinations and the first and second annual administrative reviews the combined cvd and ad rate charged on weyerhaeuser shipments of canadian softwood lumber into the united states was reduced from 3118 percent to 2436 percent effective for the first quarter of 2005 and from 2436 percent to 1313 percent effective for the first quarter of 2006 

  

on december 2 2005 the company filed a request with the department for a review of its cash deposit rate due to the sale of the bc coastal group to brascan in may 2005 the company believes that the sale constitutes a changed circumstance and the cash deposit rate should be substantially lower on january 19 2006 the department announced that it will conduct a changed circumstances review 

  

the cvd and ad tariffs are currently under review and challenge in several forums including nafta panels the itc and the wto these proceedings include 

  

appeals of administrative reviews the company has appealed the ad determination in the first administrative review to the court of international trade cit on the same date the coalition appealed both the cvd and ad determinations to the cit the various actions filed in the cit relating to the ad determination have been consolidated by court order both parties have also appealed the cvd determination in the first administrative review to nafta panels it is expected that both parties will file appeals of the final determinations in the second administrative review to natfa panels 

  

  

nafta injury panel on september 1 2004 the nafta injury panel ordered the itc to reverse its earlier decision of injury and on september 11 2004 the itc agreed that the us softwood lumber industry is not threatened with material injury by reason of softwood imports from canada in october 2004 the nafta panel affirmed the itc’s decision the final nafta decision on injury was challenged by the us trade representative ustr before a newly constituted panel called the extraordinary challenge committee ecc in august 2005 the ecc upheld the nafta decision on injury the coalition has filed a constitutional challenge of nafta at the us court of appeals for the dc circuit 

  

wto injury review with the support of provincial governments the federal government of canada also moved for reviews by dispute settlement panels under the world trade organization wto in march 2004 a wto panel announced its final ruling on injury faulting an itc finding of a threat of injury resulting from dumped and subsidized imports of softwood lumber from canada 

  

in june 2004 pursuant to us law the ustr asked the itc to provide an advisory report as to whether it can implement the wto’s decision against the itc on threat of injury in july 2004 the ustr also asked the itc to issue a new decision on “threat of injury” to bring the united states into compliance with the wto decision finding against the itc on injury section 129 of the uruguay round agreements act provides the basic provisions through which the us implements new ad and cvd determinations to make them consistent with an adverse wto report the itc formally began the section 129 review process in early august 2004 and issued a new determination on november 24 2004 reaffirming that imports of canadian softwood lumber pose a threat of injury to us industry in january 2005 canada requested that a nafta panel review this itc decision on threat of injury canada has also sought authorization from wto to impose 34 billion in sanctions on the us for failure to revoke the cvd and ad deposits pursuant to the wto’s decision on injury the us challenged the canadian request before the wto in november 2005 the wto panel issued a final decision upholding the itc’s finding of injury the decision has been appealed to the wto appellate body 

  

wto review of ad and cvd determinations on august 11 2004 the wto appellate body held the us practice of using zeroing to calculate antidumping margins during the investigation process was improper the department has issued a new determination under section 129 for ad rates to comply with the wto’s determination which is currently on appeal to the wto on february 14 2004 the wto appellate body held that the department’s countervailing decision was contrary to the wto agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures on november 9 2004 the ustr asked the department to undertake a section 129 process to comply with the wto appellate body decision canada has sought a compliance review at the wto for the failure of the us to fully implement the wto cvd decision a decision is expected later in the year in addition canada has filed a request for a nafta panel to review the section 129 cvd decision 

  

byrd amendment the wto appeals body has affirmed a panel ruling against the united states that the socalled “byrd amendment” which provides for the distribution of ad and cvd duties to petitioners is inconsistent with us international obligations on september 1 2004 the wto gave canada and other countries the right to impose trade sanctions on the united states in retaliation for collecting such duties and making them available for distribution under the byrd amendment on march 31 2005 canada announced a retaliation surtax commencing may 1 2005 of 15 percent against certain us goods exported to canada the aggregate amount of this surtax is approximately 14 million canadian the us administration for a number of years signaled that it will introduce legislation to repeal the byrd amendment the house of representatives on november 18 2005 as part of a vote on other legislation voted to repeal the byrd amendment but the senate amended the house repeal language when it voted to approve the repeal on december 21 2005 the senate amendment postpones the effect of the repeal until october 1 2007 on august 26 2005 canada filed a challenge to the byrd amendment in the us court of international trade alleging that even under us law the byrd amendment is not applicable to canada oral argument is scheduled for april 2006 with a decision expected in july 2006 there also are two cases pending at the court of international trade unrelated to the softwood case challenging the constitutionality of the byrd amendment 

  

through december 2005 the company has paid a cumulative total of 345 million in cvd and ad duties and 21 million in related costs on softwood lumber the company has imported into the united states from canada the deposits made against the cvd and ad duties have been recognized as sales deductions in the consolidated statement 

  

  

of earnings it is difficult to predict the net effect final duties will have on the company in the event that final rates differ from the depository rates ultimate charges may be higher or lower than those recorded to date the company is unable to estimate at this time the amount of additional charges or reversals that may be necessary for this matter in the future the company believes there should be a negotiated settlement to the softwood lumber dispute and supports efforts to reach a longterm solution to resolve this matter the us and canadian governments continue to discuss ways to settle the softwood lumber dispute but there can be no assurance that they will be able to reach an agreement 

  

kraft linerlinerboard exported from the united states into the people’s republic of china

environmental matters 

in late 2002 the environmental protection agency epa issued a notice of violation nov for alleged violations of the clean air act at the company’s hawesville kentucky pulp and paper mill the company settled the matter and paid a penalty of approximately 150000 

  

in november 2004 the oklahoma department of environmental quality — air quality division deq issued a nov for alleged violations of the clean air act at the company’s wright city oklahoma wood products facility management has been discussing the issues with the deq to resolve the matters alleged in the nov and believes that settlement of the matter may include payment of a civil penalty of approximately 100000 

  

in october 2005 the company notified the epa and the georgia department of natural resources that a selfaudit of its flint river pulp mill in oglethorpe georgia revealed certain areas that were not in compliance with the clean air act the company has submitted a remediation plan to both agencies that is designed to get the mill back into compliance as quickly as possible no penalties have been assessed or paid related to this matter

remediation and the possible range of additional future costs the company has assumed that it will not bear the entire cost of remediation of every site to the exclusion of other known potentially responsible parties who may be jointly and severally liable the ability of other potentially responsible parties to participate has been taken into account generally based on each party’s financial condition and probable contribution on a persite basis no amounts have been recorded for potential recoveries from insurance carriers

natural resource and environmental matters 

  

growing and harvesting timber are subject to numerous laws and government policies to protect the environment nontimber resources such as wildlife and water and other social values changes in those laws and policies can significantly affect local or regional timber harvest levels and market values of timberbased raw materials 

  

in the united states a number of fish and wildlife species that inhabit geographic areas near or within company timberlands have been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal endangered species act esa or similar state laws federal esa listings include the northern spotted owl marbled murrelet a number of salmon species bull trout and 

  

steelhead trout in the pacific northwest and the redcockaded woodpecker gopher tortoise and american burying beetle in the southeast listings of additional species or populations may result from pending or future citizen petitions or be initiated by federal or state agencies federal and state requirements to protect habitat for threatened and endangered species have resulted in restrictions on timber harvest on some timberlands including some timberlands of the company additional listings of fish and wildlife species as endangered threatened or sensitive under the esa and similar state laws as well as regulatory actions taken by federal or state agencies to protect habitat for these species may in the future result in additional restrictions on timber harvests and other forest management practices could increase operating costs and could affect timber supply and prices 

  

in the united states federal state and local regulations protecting water quality and wetlands also could affect future harvest and forest management practices on some of the company’s timberlands forest practice acts in some states in the united states increasingly affect present or future harvest and forest management activities for example in some states these acts limit the size of clearcuts require some timber to be left unharvested to protect water quality and fish and wildlife habitat regulate construction and maintenance of forest roads require reforestation following timber harvest and contain procedures for state agencies to review and approve proposed forest practice activities some states and some local governments regulate certain forest practices through various permit programs each state in which the company owns timberlands has developed best management practices to reduce the effects of forest practices on water quality and aquatic habitats additional and more stringent regulations may be adopted by various state and local governments to achieve waterquality standards under the federal clean water act protect fish and wildlife habitats or achieve other public policy objectives 

  

the company operates under the sustainable forestry initiative ®  a certification standard designed to supplement government regulatory programs with voluntary landowner initiatives to further protect certain public resources and values the sustainable forestry initiative ® is an independent standard overseen by a governing board consisting of conservation organizations academia the forest industry and large and small forest landowners compliance with the sustainable forestry initiative ® may result in some increases in operating costs and curtailment of timber harvests in some areas 

  

the regulatory and nonregulatory forest management programs described above have increased operating costs resulted in changes in the value of timber and logs from the company’s timberlands and contributed to increases in the prices paid for wood products and wood chips during periods of high demand these kinds of programs also can make it more difficult to respond to rapid changes in markets extreme weather or other unexpected circumstances one additional effect may be further reductions in usage of and some substitution of other products for lumber and plywood the company does not believe that these kinds of programs have had or in 2005 will have a significant effect on the company’s total harvest of timber in the united states or any major us region although they may have such an effect in the future further the company does not expect to be disproportionately affected by these programs as compared with typical owners of comparable timberlands likewise management does not expect that these programs will significantly disrupt its planned operations over large areas or for extended periods 

  

weyerhaeuser’s forest operations in canada are primarily carried out on public forestlands under forest licenses although the company also owns substantial amounts of timberland in western british columbia bc the announced sale of bc timberlands is expected to close in the second quarter of 2005 all forest operations are subject to forest practices and environmental regulations and operations under licenses also are subject to contractual requirements between the company and the relevant province designed to protect environmental and other social values in canada the federal species at risk act sara was enacted in 2002 sara enacted protective measures for species identified as being at risk and for critical habitat to date sara has not had an effect on the operations of the company however it is anticipated that sara will result in some additional restrictions on timber harvests and other forest management practices and will increase some operating costs for operators of forestlands in canada sara is also expected to affect timber supply and prices in the future 

  

the company participates in the canadian standards association sustainable forest management system standard a voluntary certification system that further protects certain public resources and values compliance with this standard will result in some increases in operating costs and curtailment of timber harvests in some areas in canada 

  

many of these canadian forestlands also are subject to the constitutionally protected treaty or commonlaw rights of the aboriginal peoples of canada most of bc is not covered by treaties and as a result the claims of bc’s aboriginal peoples 

  

relating to forest resources are largely unresolved although many aboriginal groups are actively engaged in treaty discussions with the governments of bc and canada final or interim resolution of aboriginal claims may be expected to result in a negotiated decrease in the lands or timber available for forest operations under license in bc including the company’s licenses in a case brought by the council of haida nations against bc the supreme court of canada ruled in 2004 that the province of bc has legally enforceable duties to the haida to consult with and accommodate them with respect to forestry activities on the queen charlotte islands in october 2004 the lyackson first nation registered an objection to the proposed subdivision by the company of privately owned lands on valdes island in bc on the basis that the lyackson first nations’ aboriginal interests had not been sufficiently addressed in december 2004 the hupacasath first nation petitioned a court of general jurisdiction in bc for a declaration that the province had failed to meaningfully consult with them before deciding to remove private lands owned by the company from a company tree farm license and that they have aboriginal interests in these lands the negotiation and resolution of aboriginal land claims and any claim such as those brought by these aboriginal groups are expected to result in additional restrictions on the sale or harvest of timber and may increase operating costs and affect timber supply and prices in canada the company believes that such claims will not have a significant effect on the company’s total harvest of timber or production of forest products in 2005 although they may have such an effect in the future 

  

the company is also subject to federal state and provincial and local pollution controls with regard to air water and land solid and hazardous waste management disposal and remediation laws and regulations in all areas in which it has operations as well as market demands with respect to chemical content of some products and use of recycled fiber compliance with these laws regulations and demands usually involves capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs the company cannot easily quantify future amounts of capital expenditures required to comply with these laws regulations and demands or the effects on operating costs because in some instances compliance standards have not been developed or have not become final or definitive in addition compliance with standards frequently serves other purposes such as extension of facility life increase in capacity changes in raw material requirements or increase in economic value of assets or products while it is difficult to isolate the environmental component of most manufacturing capital projects the company estimates that capital expenditures for environmental compliance were approximately 46 million in 2004 9 percent of total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and real estate and related assets based on its understanding of current regulatory requirements in the united states and canada the company expects that capital expenditures for environmental compliance will be approximately 44 million in 2005 5 percent of expected total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and real estate and related assets 

  

the company is involved in the environmental investigation or remediation of numerous sites some of the sites are on property presently or formerly owned by the company where the company has the sole obligation to remediate the site or shares that obligation with one or more parties others are thirdparty sites involving several parties who have a joint and several obligation to remediate the site and some are superfund sites where the company has been named as a potentially responsible party the company’s liability with respect to these sites ranges from insignificant at some sites to substantial at others depending on the quantity toxicity and nature of materials deposited by the company at the site and with respect to some sites the number and economic viability of the other responsible parties 

  

the company spent approximately 10 million in 2004 and expects to spend approximately 18 million in 2005 on environmental remediation of these sites it is the company’s policy to accrue for environmental remediation costs when it is determined that it is probable that such an obligation exists and the amount of the obligation can be reasonably estimated based on currently available information the company believes that it is reasonably possible that costs associated with all identified sites may exceed current accruals of 38 million by amounts that may prove insignificant or that could range in the aggregate up to approximately 60 million over several years this estimate of the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs is much less certain than the estimates upon which accruals are currently based and utilizes assumptions less favorable to the company among the range of reasonably possible outcomes 

  

the united states environmental protection agency us epa has promulgated regulations dealing with air emissions from pulp and paper manufacturing facilities including regulations on hazardous air pollutants that require use of maximum achievable control technology mact and controls for pollutants that contribute to smog and haze the final cluster rule package of regulations affecting the pulp and paper segment of the industry went into effect in 1998 the us epa has also adopted mact standards for air emissions from wood products facilities and industrial boilers the company anticipates that it might spend as much as 64 million over the next several years to comply with the mact standards including the cluster rules the company cannot quantify future capital requirements needed to comply with new 

  

regulations being developed by the us epa or canadian environmental agencies because final rules have not been promulgated however the company does not anticipate at this time that compliance with the new regulations will result in capital expenditures in any year that are material in relation to the company’s annual capital expenditures 

  

the american forest  paper association has made a commitment on behalf of all members of the association to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 2012 the company also is actively participating in negotiations between the forest products association of canada and natural resources canada to define industry obligations for complying with canada’s national plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions over the next several years the company cannot estimate what expenditures may ultimately be required to contribute to these commitments but does not expect significant expenditures in 2005 during 2004 the company continued its work with international national and regional policy makers in their efforts to develop technically sound and economically viable policies practices and procedures for measuring reporting and managing greenhouse gas emissions 

  

the us epa has repealed the regulations promulgated in 2000 that would have required states to develop total maximum daily load tmdl allocations for pollutants in water bodies determined to be waterqualityimpaired however states continue to promulgate tmdl requirements the state tmdl requirements may set limits on pollutants that may be discharged to a body of water or set additional requirements such as best management practices for nonpoint sources including timberland operations to reduce the amounts of pollutants it is not possible to estimate the capital expenditures that may be required for the company to meet pollution allocations across the various proposed state tmdl programs until a specific tmdl is promulgated

 item 3 legal proceedings legal proceedings hardboard siding claims the company announced in june 2000 it had entered into a proposed nationwide settlement of its hardboard siding class action cases and as a result took a charge of 130 million before taxes to cover the estimated cost of the settlement and related claims the court approved the settlement in december 2000 an appeal from the settlement was denied in march 2002 and the settlement is now binding on all parties in the third quarter of 2001 the company reassessed the adequacy of the reserve and increased the reserve by an additional 43 million the company incurred claims and related costs in the amount of 11 million in 2003 11 million in 2002 and 37 million in 2001 and charged these costs against the reserve as of december 28 2003 the company had approximately 83 million in reserves remaining for hardboard siding claims while the company believes that the reserve balances established for these matters are adequate the company is unable to estimate at this time the amount of additional charges if any that may be required for these matters in the future the settlement class consists of all persons who own or owned structures in the united states on which the company’s hardboard siding had been installed from january 1 1981 through december 31 1999 this is a claimsbased settlement which means that the claims will be paid as submitted over a nineyear period an independent adjuster will review each claim submitted and determine whether it qualifies for payment under the terms of the settlement agreement the following table presents an analysis of the claims activity related to the hardboard siding class action cases  the increase in the average damage award paid in 2003 was due primarily to the existence of more awards for multifamily structures and fewer awards for single family residences in 2003 than in 2002 or 2001 the company negotiated settlements with its insurance carriers for recovery of 52 million of costs related to these claims the company has received the full 52 million in recoveries from its insurance carriers the company is a defendant in state trial court in three cases that are outside of the settlement involving primarily multifamily structures and residential developments one of those cases was settled in january 2004 and the impact was not significant the company anticipates that other individuals and entities that have opted out of the settlement may file lawsuits against the company in january 2002 a jury returned a verdict in favor of the company in a lawsuit involving hardboard siding manufactured by the company and installed by a developer in a residential development located in modesto california the verdict has been appealed and is not included in the three cases mentioned at the state court level antitrust litigation in may 1999 two civil antitrust lawsuits were filed against the company in us district court eastern district of pennsylvania both suits name as defendants several other major containerboard and packaging producers the complaint in the first case alleges the defendants conspired to fix the price of linerboard and that the alleged conspiracy had the effect of increasing the price of corrugated containers the suit requested class certification for purchasers of corrugated containers during the period from october 1993 through november 1995 the complaint in the second case alleges that the company conspired to manipulate the price of linerboard and thereby the price of corrugated sheets the suit requested class certification for purchasers of corrugated sheets during the period october 1993 through november 1995 both suits seek damages including treble damages under the antitrust laws no specific damage amounts have been claimed in september 2001 the district court certified both classes class certification was upheld on appeal and class members were given until june 9 2003 to opt out of the class approximately 165 members of the classes have opted out and filed lawsuits against the company in federal and state courts in september 2003 the company georgiapacific and international paper filed a motion with the court requesting preliminary approval of a 68 million settlement of the class action litigation weyerhaeuser’s portion was approximately 23 million before taxes the company recognized an aftertax charge of 15 million or 7 cents per share in the third quarter of 2003 the court granted final approval of the settlement in december 2003 since no objections were filed the settlement is final and binding on the companies and class members the company has not recorded a reserve for the optout cases and is unable to estimate at this time the amount of charges if any that may be required for this matter in the future 11 weyerhaeuser company and subsidiaries part i 

item 3 legal proceedings – continued in december 2000 a lawsuit was filed against the company in us district court in oregon alleging that from 1996 to present the company had monopoly power or attempted to gain monopoly power in the pacific northwest market for alder logs and finished alder lumber in august 2001 the complaint was amended to add an additional plaintiff prior to trial one of the plaintiffs withdrew from the litigation in april 2003 the jury returned a verdict in favor of one of the plaintiffs in the amount of 26 million which was automatically trebled to 79 million under the antitrust laws the company took a pretax charge of 79 million in its first quarter 2003 results the company’s motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict was denied in july 2003 the company has appealed the matter to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit while the company believes that the reserve balance established for this matter is adequate the company is unable to estimate at this time the amount of additional charges if any which may be required for this matter in the future in april 2003 two separate lawsuits were filed in us district court in oregon alleging that the company violated antitrust laws by monopolizing the markets for alder sawlogs and finished alder lumber in june 2003 amended complaints were filed in both matters the first suit the westwood case was brought by four separate corporations located in oregon and washington that allege that between 1999 and the present they suffered damages and asked the court to award damages after trebling of 101

of alder sawmills in oregon washington and british columbia in july 2003 the company filed a motion to dismiss based on the insufficiencies in the pleadings the judge directed the plaintiffs to correct deficiencies in the pleadings but refused to dismiss the case the company renewed its motion to dismiss after review of the amended complaint in november 2003 the court granted the company’s

deficiencies in the amended complaint in november 2003 the court allowed a third amended complaint to be filed the court also ruled that weyerhaeuser would be precluded from litigating whether it attempted to and did willfully acquire and maintain monopoly power over alder sawlogs in the pacific northwest through anticompetitive conduct between 1996 and 2001 the court also precluded weyerhaeuser from contesting that its conduct did not cause the prevailing plaintiff in the alder case that is on appeal material antitrust injury we believe the court’s rulings are wrong as a matter of law and filed a motion to certify the matter for immediate appellate review by the court of appeals for the ninth circuit or in the alternative for reconsideration by the trial court the trial court denied both motions in december 2003 the case is scheduled to go to trial on march 9 2004 we have recently received information from plaintiffs seeking a range of damages after trebling of

northwest hardwoods division a portion of its alder sawmills in british columbia oregon and washington and certain forest licenses acquired in canada have been dropped from the complaint the company filed a motion to dismiss on the basis that the case should be heard in canada rather than the united states because it involves an acquisition approved by canadian regulatory bodies the motion to dismiss was denied in october 2003 the company filed a motion for summary judgment on all antitrust claims the court denied this motion in february 2004 trial of this case is scheduled to begin on june 1 2004 in june 2003 an alder antitrust complaint was filed in us district court in oregon by washington alder an alder sawmill located in washington the complaint alleges monopolization of the

westwood case and trial is scheduled to begin on may 11 2004 although the company denies liability and is vigorously defending these followon cases all of the followon cases will be presided over by the same judge who presided in the case that is on appeal and the judge has issued a number of rulings adverse to the company including a ruling in the westwood case precluding the company from contesting key issues that were decided against the company in the alder lawsuit on appeal accordingly the company recognizes that the company is not likely to prevail at the trial court level in these cases and intends to appeal any adverse judgments in these cases the company has not recorded reserves related to these lawsuits and is unable to estimate at this time the amount of charges if any that may be required for these lawsuits in the future 12 weyerhaeuser company and subsidiaries part i 

item 3 legal proceedings – continued paragon trade brands inc litigation in may 1999 the equity committee committee in the paragon trade brands inc paragon bankruptcy proceeding filed a motion in us bankruptcy court for the northern district of georgia for authority to prosecute claims against the company in the name of the debtor’s estate specifically the committee asserted that the company breached certain warranties in agreements entered into between paragon and the company in connection with paragon’s public offering of common stock in january 1993 the committee seeks to recover damages sustained by paragon as a result of two patent infringement cases one brought by procter  gamble and the other by kimberlyclark in september 1999 the court authorized the committee to commence an adversary proceeding against the company the committee commenced this proceeding in october 1999 pursuant to a reorganization of paragon the litigation claims representative for the bankruptcy estate became the plaintiff in the proceeding in june 2002 the bankruptcy court issued an oral opinion granting the plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment holding the company liable to plaintiff for breaches of warranty and denying the company’s motion for summary judgment in october 2002 the bankruptcy court issued a written order confirming the june oral opinion in november 2002 the company filed a motion for reconsideration with the bankruptcy court in june 2003 the judge issued an oral ruling denying the motion for reconsideration and set an october 30 2003 trial date for determination of the damages in september 2003 the us district court declined to grant discretionary review of the bankruptcy court’s partial summary judgment decision on liability the damages phase of the case began on october 30 2003 and was concluded on december 16 2003 the bankruptcy court initially asked both parties to present findings of fact and conclusions of law by the end of january 2004 but then extended the date to february 9 2004 the damages requested by the plaintiff have changed in october 1999 the plaintiff was seeking damages in excess of 420 million in its proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law the plaintiff requested damages in the range of 675 to 832 million primarily as a result of a new request for prejudgment interest the company believes the plaintiff is not entitled to prejudgment interest under applicable law the amount of damages if any the company may ultimately be exposed to is dependent on many unknown factors such as how the damages issues remaining to be decided by the bankruptcy court are resolved whether an appeal to the us district court andor court of appeals for the 11 th circuit is successful the outcome of any retrial ordered by an appellate court and whether a summary judgment in favor of the company on liability is ordered by an appellate court the company has not established a reserve for this matter and is unable to estimate at this time the amount of charges if any that may be required in the future the company plans to appeal the partial summary judgment decision on liability and any damages award on completion of the damages phase of the trial other litigation the company is a party to other matters generally incidental to its business in addition to the matters described above summary although the final outcome of any legal proceeding is subject to a great many variables and cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty management currently believes that adequate reserves have been established for probable losses from litigation when the amount could be reasonably determined management further believes that the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings could be material to operating results or cash flows in any given quarter or year but will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s longterm results of operations liquidity or financial position countervailing and antidumping duties in april of 2001 the coalition for fair lumber imports coalition filed two petitions with the us department of commerce department and the international trade commission itc claiming that production of softwood lumber in canada was being subsidized by canada and that imports from canada were being “dumped” into the us market sold at less than fair value the coalition asked that countervailing duty cvd and antidumping tariffs be imposed on softwood lumber imported from canada in march 2002 the department confirmed its preliminary finding that certain canadian provinces were subsidizing logs by failing to collect full market price for stumpage the department established a final cvd rate of 1879 percent in the antidumping proceedings the department found that the six canadian manufacturers examined including the company were engaged in sales at less than fair value and set cash deposit rates ranging from 218 percent to 1244 percent the company’s deposit rate was set at 1239 percent because of statutory limitations that affected timing the bonds covering duties following the preliminary determinations were released by the united states the resulting reversal of accrued expenses was included in earnings during 2002 13 weyerhaeuser company and subsidiaries part i 

item 3 legal proceedings – continued in may 2002 the itc confirmed its earlier ruling that us industry is threatened by subsidized and dumped imports as a result the company has made cash deposits relating to the cvd and antidumping actions at the rate of approximately 25 to 30 million a quarter following is a summary of the cvd and antidumping amounts recorded in the company’s statement of earnings  in june 2003 the department began the process of an annual review to determine whether the company had engaged in dumping and whether canada continued to subsidize softwood logs and if so the dumping duty and cvd to impose it is expected that final verification and determination should be complete in late 2004 the determination will be subject to further review if appealed the annual review process will be conducted for a period of five years in 2007 both the countervailing duty and antidumping orders will be automatically reviewed in a “sunset” proceeding to determine whether dumping will continue or a countervailing subsidy is likely to recur the canadian government the company and other canadian companies appealed the department’s antidumping and cvd and the itc’s injury 2002 determinations in separate appeals under the north american free trade agreement nafta the panel convened to review the department’s findings on antidumping ruled that the department must change its methodology for computing differences in merchandise when there is no product sold domestically that is similar to the exported product and as a result “comparable” products are used to calculate whether dumping is occurring the panel convened to review the cvd decision ruled that crossborder comparisons are an invalid method to determine and measure subsidies finally the panel convened to review the itc finding of a threat of injury found that the itc’s findings were not supported by the record and ordered the itc to reconsider the findings if the itc fails to support its findings of threat of injury the deposits collected to date would be refunded with the support of provincial governments the federal government of canada also moved for review by dispute settlement panels under the world trade organization wto and those reviews are currently in process one wto panel has also issued an opinion finding that crossborder comparisons to determine and measure subsidies are not proper in addition the wto appeals body has affirmed a panel ruling against the united states that the socalled “byrd amendment” which gives us firms cash from antidumping and countervailing duties applied on foreign imports is inconsistent with us international obligations the us administration has recommended that the law be changed to comply with that ruling but whether or when congress will implement that recommendation is uncertain in december 2003 the department issued a decision on the remand from the nafta panel in the cvd investigation if the decision on remand is not further appealed or altered it would have the effect of reducing the applicable cvd deposit rate to 133 percent in addition the wto appellate body recently issued a decision in the cvd case and a wto panel is expected to issue a decision shortly in the antidumping case it is not possible to predict whether these decisions will be appealed or their impact on weyerhaeuser’s business at this time it is difficult to predict the net effect final duties will have on the company in the event that final rates differ from the depository rates ultimate charges may be higher or lower than those recorded to date the company is unable to estimate at this time the amount of additional charges or reversals that may be necessary for this matter in the future the us and canadian governments continue to discuss ways to settle the softwood lumber dispute but there can be no assurance that they will be able to reach agreement or the terms and conditions of any agreement 14 weyerhaeuser company and subsidiaries part i

 item 3 legal proceedings countervailing and antidumping duties in april of 2001 the coalition for fair lumber imports coalition filed two petitions with the us department of commerce department and the international trade commission itc claiming that production of softwood lumber in canada was being subsidized by canada and that imports from canada were being “dumped” into the us market and sold at less than fair value the coalition asked that countervailing duty cvd and antidumping tariffs be imposed on softwood lumber imported from canada in march 2002 the department confirmed its preliminary finding that certain canadian provinces were subsidizing logs by failing to collect full market price for stumpage and established a final cvd rate of 1879 percent because the final determination eliminated the 90day retroactive duties weyerhaeuser reversed its 18 million accrual for the retroactive portion of the cvd during the first quarter of 2002 the charge for the retroactive portion of the cvd had been recognized during 2001 in may 2002 the itc confirmed its earlier ruling that us industry is threatened by subsidized and dumped imports its finding of only threat of injury means that the cvd and antidumping duties will be collected only for the period beginning with the publication of its final order on may 22 2002 in the antidumping portion of the case the department selected weyerhaeuser and five canadian companies to provide data for the antidumping investigation in its preliminary ruling issued on october 30 2001 the department found that weyerhaeuser had engaged in dumping and set a preliminary “dumping margin” for weyerhaeuser in the final determination weyerhaeuser’s depository rate was set at 1239 percent with the finding by the itc of only threat of injury the antidumping accrual of 29 million recorded in 2001 and 13 million recorded in 2002 were reversed on weyerhaeuser’s books during the second quarter following is a summary of the cvd and antidumping amounts recorded in weyerhaeuser’s statement of earnings  approximately one year following the publication of the final order and annually thereafter for a total of five years the department will conduct reviews to determine whether weyerhaeuser had engaged in dumping and whether canada continued to subsidize softwood logs and if so the dumping margin and cvd to impose at the end of five years both the countervailing duty and antidumping orders will be automatically reviewed in a “sunset” proceeding to determine whether dumping or a countervailing subsidy will continue or recur weyerhaeuser is appealing under the north american free trade agreement nafta panels have been appointed and will review the imposition of the antidumping duty and the cvd with the support of provincial governments the federal government of canada also moved for appellate review by panels under the world trade organization wto in july 2002 the wto issued two interim rulings against the united states the first ruling was against the socalled “byrd amendment” which gives us firms cash from punitive trade sanctions applied on foreign imports the appeals body affirmed the ruling in january 2003 the second ruling was that a key measure used in the cvd to determine the existence of a subsidy is improper this is viewed by the united states as having been made moot by a final determination in the investigation 11 weyerhaeuser company and subsidiaries part i item 3 legal proceedings — continued it is difficult to predict the net effect final duties will have on weyerhaeuser in the event that the cvd and antidumping margins are determined to be improper the charges incurred for these duties may be reversed and weyerhaeuser could receive reimbursement for amounts paid to date in the event that final rates differ from the depository rates ultimate charges may be higher or lower than those recorded to date weyerhaeuser is unable to estimate at this time the amount of additional charges or reversals that may be necessary for this matter in the future hardboard siding claims weyerhaeuser announced in june 2000 it had entered into a proposed nationwide settlement of its hardboard siding class action cases and as a result took a pretax charge of 130 million to cover the estimated cost of the settlement and related claims the court approved the settlement in december 2000 an appeal from the settlement was denied in march 2002 and is now binding on all parties in the third quarter of 2001 weyerhaeuser reassessed the adequacy of the reserve and increased the reserve by an additional 43 million weyerhaeuser incurred claims and related costs in the amount of 11 million in 2002 37 million in 2001 and 31 million in 2000 and charged these costs against the reserve while the company believes that the reserve balances established for these matters are adequate the company is unable to estimate at this time the amount of additional charges that may be required for these matters in the future the settlement class consists of all persons who own or owned structures in the united states on which weyerhaeuser’s hardboard siding had been installed from january 1 1981 through december 31 1999 this is a claimsbased settlement which means that the claims will be paid as submitted over a nineyear period an independent adjuster will review each claim submitted and determine whether it qualifies for payment under the terms of the settlement agreement the following table presents an analysis of the claims activity related to the hardboard siding class action cases  the company negotiated settlements with its insurance carriers for recovery of certain costs related to these claims as of december 29 2002 weyerhaeuser has either received or accrued 52 million in recoveries from its insurance carriers at the end of 2002 the company is a defendant in state trial court in nine cases that are outside of the settlement involving primarily multifamily structures and residential developments the company anticipates that other individuals and entities that have opted out of the settlement may file lawsuits against the company in january 2002 a jury returned a verdict in favor of the company in a lawsuit involving hardboard siding manufactured by weyerhaeuser and installed by a developer in a residential development located in modesto california the verdict has been appealed and is not included in the nine cases mentioned at the state court level 12 weyerhaeuser company and subsidiaries part i item 3 legal proceedings – continued antitrust litigation in may 1999 two civil antitrust lawsuits were filed against the company in us district court eastern district of pennsylvania both suits name as defendants several other major containerboard and packaging producers the complaint in the first case alleges the defendants conspired to fix the price of linerboard and that the alleged conspiracy had the effect of increasing the price of corrugated containers the suit requested class certification for purchasers of corrugated containers during the period from october 1993 through november 1995 the complaint in the second case alleges that the company conspired to manipulate the price of linerboard and thereby the price of corrugated sheets the suit requested class certification for purchasers of corrugated sheets during the period october 1993 through november 1995 both suits seek damages including treble damages under the antitrust laws no specific damage amounts have been claimed in september 2001 the district court certified both classes on appeal the 3rd circuit court of appeals affirmed the trial court’s certification of the two classes the company and other defendants have sought certiorari with the us supreme court to review the class certification issue at the trial level discussions have begun on reactivating pretrial discovery efforts trial has been set for april 2004 in december 2000 a lawsuit was filed against the company in us district court in oregon alleging that from 1996 to present weyerhaeuser had monopoly power or attempted to gain monopoly power in the pacific northwest market for alder logs and finished alder lumber in august 2001 the complaint was amended to add an additional plaintiff the plaintiffs have requested relief including treble damages of 110 million in october 2002 the company filed motions for summary judgment on several issues in january 2003 the court denied the company’s motions trial is scheduled for april 8 2003 paragon trade brands inc litigation in may 1999 the equity committee committee in the paragon trade brands inc paragon bankruptcy proceeding filed a motion in us bankruptcy court for the northern district of georgia for authority to prosecute claims against the company in the name of the debtor’s estate specifically the committee asserted that the company breached certain warranties in agreements entered into between paragon and the company in connection with paragon’s public offering of common stock in january 1993 the committee seeks to recover damages sustained by paragon as a result of two patent infringement cases one brought by procter  gamble and the other by kimberlyclark in september 1999 the court authorized the committee to commence an adversary proceeding against the company the committee commenced this proceeding in october 1999 seeking damages in excess of 420 million against the company pursuant to a reorganization of paragon the litigation claims representative for the bankruptcy estate became the plaintiff in the proceeding on june 26 2002 the bankruptcy court issued an oral opinion granting the plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment holding weyerhaeuser liable to plaintiff for breaches of warranty and denying the company’s motion for summary judgment on october 30 2002 the bankruptcy court issued a written order confirming the june oral opinion in november 2002 the company filed motion for reconsideration with the bankruptcy court the court has not ruled on the company’s motion no trial date has been set for the determination of the damages weyerhaeuser disagrees with the bankruptcy court’s decision and will diligently pursue all available relief other litigation the company is a party to other matters generally incidental to its business in addition to the matters described above summary although the final outcome of any legal proceeding is subject to a great many variables and cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty the company’s management presently believes that resolving all of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position liquidity or its results of operations 13 weyerhaeuser company and subsidiaries part i item 3 legal proceedings – continued environmental matters in april 1999 willamette’s johnsonburg penn paper and pulp mill received a notice of violation nov from the us environmental protection agency epa for alleged violations of the clean air act caa management has met with federal and state officials to resolve the matters alleged in the nov and will continue to work with officials to narrow issues in dispute management believes that it is reasonably possible that a settlement will be reached at a future date that may involve payment of a penalty of up to approximately 1 million and the installation of pollution control equipment the company is also a party to various proceedings relating to the cleanup of hazardous waste sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as “superfund” and similar state laws the epa andor various state agencies have notified the company that it may be a potentially responsible party with respect to other hazardous waste sites as to which no proceedings have been instituted against the company the company has established reserves for remediation costs on all of the approximately 79 active sites across its operations as of the end of 2002 totaling 54 million up from 45 million at the end of 2001 this increase reflects the incorporation of new information on all sites concerning remediation alternatives updates on prior cost estimates and new sites less the costs incurred to remediate these sites during this period the company accrued remediation costs of 18 million in 2002 and 34 million in 2000 in 2001 the company reduced the accruals by 8 million the company incurred remediation costs of 9 million in 2002 14 million in 2001 and 12 million in 2000 and charged these costs against the reserve based on currently available information and analysis the company believes that it is reasonably possible that costs associated with all identified sites may exceed current accruals by amounts that may prove insignificant or that could range in the aggregate up to approximately 100 million over several years this estimate of the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs is much less certain than the estimates upon which accruals are currently based and utilizes assumptions less favorable to the company among the range of reasonably possible outcomes in estimating both its current accruals for environmental remediation and the possible range of additional future costs the company has assumed that it will not bear the entire cost of remediation of every site to the exclusion of other known potentially responsible parties who may be jointly and severally liable the ability of other potentially responsible parties to participate has been taken into account based generally on each party’s financial condition and probable contribution on a persite basis no amounts have been recorded for potential recoveries from insurance carriers
