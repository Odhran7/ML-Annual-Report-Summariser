covid19 update 

the covid19 pandemic continues to impact our business performance as it relates to occupancy and leasing volumes and how revenue recognition is impacted by rent collections and tenant credit risk rent collection rates since the pandemic began have been lower than historical prepandemic averages but have steadily increased during 2021 since the low point in the second quarter of 2020 collection rates may remain lower than historical prepandemic averages for the foreseeable future the ability of tenants to successfully operate their businesses and pay rent continues to be significantly influenced by pandemicrelated challenges such as rising costs labor shortages supply chain constraints reduced instore sales the emergence of new variants of the covid19 virus effectiveness of vaccines against variants and the impact of mask and vaccine mandates we anticipate that the extent to which the covid19 pandemic continues to impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows will continue to depend on the severity of covid19 variants the effectiveness of vaccines against them and the ability of our current and prospective tenants to operate their businesses in the face of these pandemicrelated challenges

environmental laws and regulations 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we may be liable for the cost to assess and remediate certain hazardous substances at our shopping centers to the extent any environmental issues arise they most typically stem from the historic practices of current and former dry cleaners gas stations and other similar businesses at our centers as well as the presence of asbestos in some structures these requirements often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or committed the acts or omissions that caused the presence of the hazardous substances the presence of such substances or the failure to properly address contamination caused by such substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral although we have a number of properties that could require or are currently undergoing varying levels of assessment and remediation known environmental liabilities are not currently expected to have a material impact on our financial condition

nongaap measures 

in addition to the required generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” presentations we use certain nongaap performance measures as we believe these measures improve the understanding of the companys operational results we believe these nongaap measures provide useful information to our board of directors management and investors regarding certain trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations our management uses these nongaap measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses purposes of determining management incentive compensation and budgeting forecasting and planning purposes we continually evaluate the usefulness relevance limitations and calculation of our reported nongaap performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public and thus such reported measures could change 

we do not consider nongaap measures an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with gaap rather they supplement gaap measures by providing additional information we believe to be useful to our shareholders the principal limitation of these nongaap financial measures is they may exclude significant expense and income items that are required by gaap to be recognized in our consolidated financial statements in addition they reflect the exercise of management’s judgment about which expense and income items are excluded or included in determining these nongaap financial measures in order to compensate for these limitations reconciliations of the nongaap financial measures we use to their most directly comparable gaap measures are provided nongaap financial measures should not be relied upon in evaluating the financial condition results of operations or future prospects of the company 

defined terms 

the following terms as defined are commonly used by management and the investing public to understand and evaluate our operational results 

• core operating earnings is an additional performance measure we use because the computation of nareit funds from operations “nareit ffo” includes certain noncomparable items that affect our periodoverperiod performance core operating earnings excludes from nareit ffo i transaction related income or expenses ii gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt iii certain noncash components of earnings derived from above and below market rent amortization straightline rents and amortization of marktomarket debt adjustments and iv other amounts as they occur we provide reconciliations of both net income attributable to common stockholders to nareit ffo and nareit ffo to core operating earnings 

  

• development completion is a property in development that is deemed complete upon the earlier of i 90 of total estimated net development costs have been incurred and percent leased equals or exceeds 95 or ii the property features at least two years of anchor operations once deemed complete the property is termed a retail operating property the following calendar year 

• fixed charge coverage ratio is defined as operating ebitda re divided by the sum of the gross interest and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders 

• nareit ebitdare is a measure of reit performance which the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines as net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding i interest expense ii income tax expense iii depreciation and amortization iv gains on sales of real estate v impairments of real estate and vi adjustments to reflect the company’s share of unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 

• nareit funds from operations “nareit ffo” is a commonly used measure of reit performance which nareit defines as net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains on sales and impairments of real estate net of tax plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures we compute nareit ffo for all periods presented in accordance with nareit’s definition 

companies use different depreciable lives and methods and real estate values historically fluctuate with market conditions since nareit ffo excludes depreciation and amortization and gains on sale and impairments of real estate it provides a performance measure that when compared year over year reflects the impact on operations from trends in percent leased rental rates operating costs acquisition and development activities and financing costs this provides a perspective of our financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with gaap thus nareit ffo is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of our operating performance which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered a substitute measure of cash flows from operations we provide a reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders to nareit ffo 

• net operating income “noi” is the sum of base rent percentage rent recoveries from tenants other lease income and other property income less operating and maintenance expenses real estate taxes ground rent and uncollectible lease income noi excludes straightline rental income and expense above and below market rent and ground rent amortization tenant lease inducement amortization and other fees we also provide disclosure of noi excluding termination fees which excludes both termination fee income and expenses 

• nonsame property is any property during either calendar year period being compared that was acquired sold a property in development a development completion or a property under or being positioned for significant redevelopment that distorts comparability between periods nonretail properties and corporate activities including the captive insurance program are part of nonsame property 

• operating ebitdare begins with the nareit ebitda re and excludes certain noncash components of earnings derived from above and below market rent amortization and straightline rents we provide a reconciliation of net income to nareit ebitda re to operating ebitda re 

• prorata information includes 100 of our consolidated properties plus our economic share based on our ownership interest in our unconsolidated real estate investment partnerships 

we provide prorata financial information because we believe it assists investors and analysts in estimating our economic interest in our consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships when read in conjunction with the company’s reported results under gaap we believe presenting our prorata share of assets liabilities operating results and other metrics along with certain other nongaap measures makes comparisons of other reits’ operating results to ours more meaningful the prorata information provided is not nor is it intended to be presented in accordance with gaap the prorata supplemental details of assets and liabilities and supplemental details of operations reflect our proportionate economic ownership of the assets liabilities and operating results of the properties in our portfolio 

the prorata information is prepared on a basis consistent with the comparable consolidated amounts and is intended to more accurately reflect our proportionate economic interest in the assets liabilities and operating results of properties in our portfolio we do not control the unconsolidated investment partnerships and the prorata presentations of the assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses do not represent our legal claim to such items the partners are entitled to profit or loss allocations and distributions of cash flows according to the operating agreements which generally provide for such allocations according to their invested capital our share of invested capital establishes the ownership interests we use to prepare our prorata share 

  

the presentation of prorata information has limitations which include but are not limited to the following 

o the amounts shown on the individual line items were derived by applying our overall economic ownership interest percentage determined when applying the equity method of accounting and do not necessarily represent our legal claim to the assets and liabilities or the revenues and expenses and 

o other companies in our industry may calculate their prorata interest differently limiting the comparability of prorata information 

because of these limitations the prorata financial information should not be considered independently or as a substitute for our financial statements as reported under gaap we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap financial statements using the prorata information as a supplement 

• property in development includes properties in various stages of groundup development 

• property in redevelopment includes retail operating properties under redevelopment or being positioned for redevelopment unless otherwise indicated a property in redevelopment is included in the same property pool 

• redevelopment completion is a property in redevelopment that is deemed complete upon the earlier of i 90 of total estimated project costs have been incurred and percent leased equals or exceeds 95 for the company owned gla related to the project or ii the property features at least two years of anchor operations 

• retail operating property is any retail property not termed a property in development a retail property is any property where the majority of the income is generated from retail uses 

• same property is a retail operating property that was owned and operated for the entirety of both calendar year periods being compared this term excludes properties in development prior year development completions and nonsame properties properties in redevelopment are included unless otherwise indicated 

  

  




 item 1a r isk factors 

our operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those listed below when considering an investment in our securities carefully read and consider these risks together with all other information in our other filings and submissions to the sec which provide much more information and detail if any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occur our business financial condition and or operating results as well as the market price of our securities could be materially adversely affected 

risk factors related to pandemics or other health crises 

pandemics such as covid19 or other health crises may adversely affect our tenants’ financial condition the profitability of our properties and our access to the capital markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

during the ongoing covid19 pandemic us federal state and local governments have at times mandated or recommended various actions to reduce or prevent the spread of covid19 which continue to directly impact many of our current and prospective tenants although most businesses are currently open future covid19 variants or other pandemics may cause future government ordered lockdowns or other social distancing measures that significantly reduce customer traffic 

during the height of the pandemicrelated lockdowns certain tenants requested rent concessions or sought to renegotiate future rents based on changes to the economic environment some tenants chose not to reopen or to honor the terms of their lease agreements in addition moratoria and other legal restrictions in certain states impacted our ability to bring legal action to enforce our leases and our ability to collect rent and could do so again in the future 

businesses may continue to delay executing leases amidst the immediate and uncertain future economic impacts of the pandemic and related covid19 variants this coupled with tenant failures and a reduction in newlyformed businesses may result in decreased demand for retail space in our centers which could result in downward pressure on rents additionally delays in construction of tenant improvements due to the impacts of the pandemic or constraints on supply chains and labor may result in delayed rent commencement due to it taking longer for new tenants to open and operate 

the full impacts of the pandemic on our future results of operations and overall financial performance remain uncertain although the vast majority of our lease income is derived from contractual rent payments and rent collections have recovered to near prepandemic levels the ability of certain of our tenants to meet their lease obligations has been negatively impacted by the disruptions and uncertainties of the pandemic our tenants’ ability to respond to these disruptions and uncertainties including adjusting to governmental orders and changes in their customers’ shopping habits and behaviors will impact their businesses’ ability to survive and ultimately their ability to comply with their lease obligations the risk of diminished sales and future closures exists so long as the virus remains active ultimately the duration and severity of the health crisis in the united states and the speed at which the country states and localities are able to remain open will continue to materially impact the overall economy our retail tenants and therefore our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

risk factors related to operating retailbased shopping centers 

economic and market conditions may adversely affect the retail industry and consequently reduce our revenues and cash flow and increase our operating expenses 

our properties are leased primarily to retail tenants from whom we derive most of our revenue in the form of base rent expense recoveries and other income therefore our performance and operating results are directly linked to the economic and market conditions occurring in the retail industry we are subject to the risks that upon expiration leases for space in our properties are not renewed by existing tenants vacant space is not leased to new tenants andor tenants demand modified lease terms including costs for renovations or concessions moreover pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic may exacerbate the effects of these risks the economic and market conditions potentially affecting the retail industry and our properties specifically include the following 

• changes in national regional and local economic conditions 

• changes in population and migration patterns tofrom the markets in which we operate 

• deterioration in the competitiveness and creditworthiness of our retail tenants 

• increased competition from the use of ecommerce by retailers and consumers as well as other concepts such as superstores and warehouse clubs 

  

• labor challenges and supply delays and shortages due to a variety of macroeconomic factors including disruptions on the global supply chain as a result of the ongoing covid19 pandemic and inflationary pressures 

• tenant bankruptcies and subsequent rejections of our leases 

• reductions in consumer spending and retail sales including inflationary impacts on consumer behavior 

• reduced tenant demand for retail space 

• oversupply of retail space 

• reduced consumer demand for certain retail categories 

• consolidation within the retail sector 

• increased operating costs attendant to owning and operating retail shopping centers 

• perceptions by retailers and shoppers of the safety convenience and attractiveness of our properties and 

• violent criminal acts including civil unrest acts of terrorism or mass shootings and natural disasters and other physical and weatherrelated damages to our properties which could alter shopping habits deter customers from visiting our shopping centers or result in damage to our properties 

to the extent that any or a combination of these conditions occur they are likely to impact the retail industry our retail tenants the emergence of new tenants the demand for retail space market rents and rent growth capital expenditures the percent leased levels of our properties the value of our properties our ability to sell acquire or develop properties our operating results and our cash available for distributions to stock and unit holders 

shifts in retail trends sales and delivery methods between brick and mortar stores ecommerce home delivery and curbside pickup may adversely impact our revenues and cash flows 

retailers are increasingly impacted by ecommerce and changes in customer buying habits including shopping from home and the delivery or curbside pickup of items ordered online the pandemic has likely accelerated these trends and their potential impacts retailers are considering these ecommerce trends when making decisions regarding their brick and mortar stores and how they will compete and innovate in a rapidly changing retail environment many retailers in our shopping centers provide services or sell goods which have historically been less likely to be purchased online however the continuing increase in ecommerce sales in all retail categories may cause retailers to adjust the size or number of their retail locations in the future or close stores our grocer tenants are incorporating ecommerce concepts through home delivery and curbside pickup which could reduce foot traffic at our centers in certain higherincome markets foot traffic at our centers may be impacted more meaningfully by these alternative delivery methods if consumers are willing to pay premiums for such services changes in shopping trends as a result of the growth in ecommerce may also impact the profitability of retailers that do not adapt to changes in market conditions including their financial condition and ability to pay rent this shift may adversely impact our percent leased and rental rates which would impact our results of operations and cash flows 

changing economic and retail market conditions in geographic areas where our properties are concentrated may reduce our revenues and cash flow 

economic conditions in markets where our properties are concentrated can greatly influence our financial performance our properties in california and florida accounted for 282 and 221 respectively of our 2021 noi from consolidated properties plus our prorata share from unconsolidated properties our revenues and cash flow may be adversely affected by this geographic concentration if market conditions such as supply of or demand for retail space deteriorate more significantly in these states compared to other geographic areas for example with respect to the covid19 pandemic california imposed very stringent restrictions on reopening and implemented stringent eviction moratoria which has made it more difficult in certain circumstances to collect rent and enforce our leases additionally there is a risk that many businesses and residents in major metropolitan cities may desire to relocate to different states or suburban markets as a result of the pandemic following the impact of state regulations on businesses and residents coupled with the shift to remote work 

our success depends on the continued presence and success of our “anchor” tenants 

“anchor tenants” tenants occupying 10000 square feet or more operate large stores in our shopping centers pay a significant portion of the total rent at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by attracting shoppers to the property our net income and cash flow may be adversely affected by the loss of revenues and incurrence of additional costs in the event a significant anchor tenant 

• becomes bankrupt or insolvent 

  

• experiences a downturn in its business 

• shifts its capital allocation away from brick and mortar formats 

• materially defaults on its leases 

• does not renew its leases as they expire 

• renews at lower rental rates andor requires a tenant improvement allowance or 

• renews but reduces its store size which results in downtime and additional tenant improvement costs to the landlord to release the vacated space 

some anchors have the right to vacate their space and may prevent us from retenanting by continuing to comply and pay rent in accordance with their lease agreement vacated anchor space including space that may be owned by the anchor as discussed below can reduce rental revenues generated by the shopping center in other spaces because of the loss of the departed anchors customer drawing power in addition if a significant tenant vacates a property cotenancy clauses in select lease contracts may allow other tenants to modify or terminate their rent or lease obligations cotenancy clauses have several variants they may allow a tenant to postpone a store opening if certain other tenants fail to open their stores they may allow a tenant to close its store prior to lease expiration if another tenant closes its store prior to lease expiration or more commonly they may allow a tenant to pay reduced levels of rent until a certain number of tenants open their stores within the same shopping center 

additionally some of our shopping centers are anchored by retailers who own their space whose location is within or immediately adjacent to our shopping center “shadow anchors” in those cases the shadow anchors appear to the consumer as a retail tenant of the shopping center and as a result attract additional consumer traffic to the center in the event that a shadow anchor were to close it could negatively impact our center as consumer traffic would likely be reduced 

a significant percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller “shop space” tenants and our net income may be adversely impacted if our smaller shop tenants are not successful 

at december 31 2021 tenants occupying less than 10000 square feet “shop space tenants” represent approximately 64 of our gla with approximately 14 of those considered local tenants these tenants may be more vulnerable to negative economic conditions including the impacts from pandemics as they may have more limited resources and access to capital than anchor tenants shop space tenants may be facing reduced sales as a result of an increase in competition including from ecommerce retailers the types of shop space tenants vary from retail shops and restaurants to service providers if we are unable to attract the right type or mix of shop space tenants into our centers our revenues and cash flow may be adversely impacted 

during times of economic downturns or uncertainties including during pandemics such as covid19 some tenants may suffer disproportionally greater impacts and be at greater risk of default on their lease obligations or request lease concessions from us if we are unable to attract the right type or mix of low or noncredit tenants into our centers our revenues and cash flow may be adversely impacted 

we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy 

although lease income is supported by longterm lease contracts tenants who file for bankruptcy have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant for unpaid rent may be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold additionally we may incur significant expense to recover our claim and to release the vacated space in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files for bankruptcy and rejects its leases we may experience a significant reduction in our revenues and may not be able to collect all prepetition amounts owed by the bankrupt tenant 

many of our costs and expenses associated with operating our properties may remain constant or increase even if our lease income decreases 

certain costs and expenses associated with our operating our properties such as real estate taxes insurance utilities and common area expenses generally do not decrease in the event of reduced occupancy or rental rates nonpayment of rents by tenants general economic downturns pandemics or other similar circumstances in fact in some cases such as real estate taxes and insurance they may actually increase despite such events as such we may not be able to lower the operating expenses of our properties sufficiently to fully offset such circumstances and may not be able to fully recoup these costs from our tenants in such cases our cash flows operating results and financial performance may be adversely impacted 

  

compliance with the americans with disabilities act and fire safety and other regulations may have a negative effect on us 

all of our properties are required to comply with the americans with disabilities act “ada” which generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities compliance with ada requirements may require removal of access barriers and noncompliance may result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants or both while the tenants to whom we lease space in our properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions and typically under tenant leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these tenants to cover costs may be adversely affected in addition we are required to operate the properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations as they may be adopted by governmental entities and become applicable to the properties costs to be in compliance with the ada or any other building regulations could be material and have a negative impact on our results of operations 

risk factors related to real estate investments 

our real estate assets may decline in value and be subject to impairment losses which may reduce our net income 

our real estate properties are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable we evaluate whether there are any indicators including property operating performance and general market conditions such that the value of the real estate properties including any related tangible or intangible assets or liabilities including goodwill may not be recoverable through the evaluation we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions including rental rates costs of tenant improvements leasing commissions anticipated holding periods and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition including the exit capitalization rate these key assumptions are subjective in nature and may differ materially from actual results changes in our investment redevelopment and disposition strategies or changes in the marketplace may alter the holding period of an asset or asset group which may result in an impairment loss and such loss may be material to the companys financial condition or operating performance to the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value 

the fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is determined through the use of comparable sales information and other market data if available or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the discounted cash flow approach such cash flow projections take into account expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other relevant criteria and therefore are subject to management judgment the impacts of the pandemic to future income trends and prospects is uncertain and continues to evolve therefore any assumptions impacting real estate values may be subject to change in the future which may impact the determination of fair value in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land we generally use market data and comparable sales information 

these subjective assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment charge results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income which may be material there can be no assurance that we will not record impairment charges in the future related to our assets 

we face risks associated with development redevelopment and expansion of properties 

we actively pursue opportunities for new retail development and existing property redevelopment or expansion development and redevelopment activities require various government and other approvals for entitlements and any delay in such approvals may significantly delay development and redevelopment projects we may not recover our investment in our projects for which approvals are not received and delays may adversely impact our expected returns additionally changes in political elections and policies may impact our ability to obtain favorable land use and zoning for inprocess and future developments and redevelopment projects we are subject to other risks associated with these activities including the following 

• we may be unable to lease developments or redevelopments to full occupancy on a timely basis 

• the occupancy rates and rents of a completed project may not be sufficient to make the project profitable 

• actual costs of a project may exceed original estimates possibly making the project unprofitable 

• delays in the development or construction process may increase our costs 

• construction cost increases may reduce investment returns on development and redevelopment opportunities 

• we may abandon development or redevelopment opportunities and lose our investment due to adverse market conditions 

  

• the size of our development and redevelopment pipeline may strain our labor or capital capacity to complete the development and redevelopment projects within targeted timelines and may reduce our investment returns 

• a reduction in the demand for new retail space may reduce our future development and redevelopment activities which in turn may reduce our net operating income and 

• changes in the level of future development and redevelopment activity may adversely impact our results from operations by reducing the amount of internal overhead costs that may be capitalized 

we face risks associated with the development of mixeduse commercial properties 

when we engage in more complex acquisitions and mixeduse development and redevelopment projects there could be more unique risks to our return on investment mixeduse projects refer to real estate projects that in addition to retail space may also include space for residential office hotel or other commercial purposes we have less experience in developing and managing nonretail real estate than we do retail real estate as a result if a development or redevelopment project includes a nonretail use we may seek to develop that component ourselves sell the rights to that component to a thirdparty developer or partner with a developer 

• if we decide to develop the nonretail components ourselves we would be exposed not only to those risks typically associated with the development of commercial real estate but also to risks associated with developing owning operating or selling nonretail real estate including but not limited to more complex entitlement processes and multiplestory buildings these unique risks may adversely impact our return on investment in these mixeduse development projects 

• if we sell the nonretail components our retail component will be impacted by the decisions made by the other owners and actions of those occupying the nonretail spaces in these mixeduse properties 

• if we partner with a developer it makes us dependent upon the partners ability to perform and to agree on major decisions that impact our investment returns of the project in addition there is a risk that the nonretail developer may default on its obligations necessitating that we complete the other components ourselves including providing necessary financing 

in addition redevelopment of existing shopping centers into mixeduse projects generally includes tenant vacancies before and during the redevelopment which could result in volatility in noi 

we face risks associated with the acquisition of properties 

our investment strategy includes investing in highquality shopping centers that are leased to marketleading grocers categoryleading anchors specialty retailers andor restaurants located in areas with high barriers to entry and above average household incomes and population densities the acquisition of properties andor real estate entities entails risks that include but are not limited to the following any of which may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

• properties we acquire may fail to achieve the occupancy or rental rates we project within the time frames we estimate which may result in the properties failure to achieve the investment returns we project 

• our investigation of an entity property or building prior to our acquisition and any representation we may have received from such seller may fail to reveal various liabilities including defects necessary repairs or environmental matters requiring corrective action which may increase our costs 

• our estimate of the costs to improve reposition or redevelop a property may prove to be too low or the time we estimate to complete the improvement repositioning or redevelopment may be too short either of which may result in the property failing to achieve our projected return either temporarily or permanently 

• we may not recover our costs from an unsuccessful acquisition 

• our acquisition activities may distract or strain our management capacity and 

• we may not be able to successfully integrate an acquisition into our existing operations platform 

we may be unable to sell properties when desired because of market conditions 

our properties including their related tangible and intangible assets represent the majority of our total consolidated assets and they may not be readily convertible to cash moreover pandemics such as covid19 and other macroeconomic events may impact our ability to sell properties on our preferred timing and at prices and returns we deem acceptable as a result our ability to sell one or more of our properties including properties held in joint ventures in response to changes in economic industry or other conditions may be limited the real estate market is affected by many factors such as general economic conditions availability and terms of 

  

financing interest rates and other factors including supply and demand for space that are beyond our control there may be less demand for lower quality properties that we have identified for ultimate disposition in markets with uncertain economic or retail environments and where buyers are more reliant on the availability of third party mortgage financing if we want to sell a property we can provide no assurance that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or at all or that the sales price of a property will be attractive at the relevant time or even exceed the carrying value of our investment 

changes in tax laws could impact our acquisition or disposition of real estate 

certain properties we own have a low tax basis which may result in a taxable gain on sale we utilize and intend to continue to utilize internal revenue code section 1031 likekind exchanges to taxefficiently buy and sell properties however there can be no assurance that we will identify properties that meet our investment objectives for acquisitions or that changes to the tax laws do not eliminate or significantly change 1031 exchanges in the event that we do not utilize 1031 exchanges we may be required to distribute the gain proceeds to shareholders or pay income tax which may reduce our cash flow available to fund our commitments or other priorities 

risk factors related to the environment affecting our properties 

climate change may adversely impact our properties directly and may lead to additional compliance obligations and costs as well as additional taxes and fees 

while we work with experts in the field to plan for the potential impacts of climate change on our business we cannot reliably predict the extent rate timing or impact of climate change to the extent climate change causes adverse changes in weather patterns our properties in certain markets especially those nearer to the coasts may experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea‑levels further population migration may occur in response to these or other factors and negatively impact our centers climate and other environmental changes may result in volatile or decreased demand for retail space at certain of our properties or in extreme cases our inability to operate certain properties at all climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of insurance or making insurance unavailable moreover while the federal government has not yet enacted comprehensive legislation to address climate change certain states in which we own and operate shopping centers including california and new york have done so compliance with these and future new laws or regulations related to climate change may require us to make improvements to our existing properties resulting in increased capital expenditures or pay additional taxes and fees assessed on us or our properties although we strive to identify analyze and respond to the risk and opportunities that climate change presents at this time there can be no assurance that we can anticipate all potential material impacts of climate change or that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on the value of our properties and our financial performance in the future 

geographic concentration of our properties makes our business more vulnerable to natural disasters severe weather conditions and climate change 

a significant number of our properties are located in areas that are susceptible to earthquakes tropical storms hurricanes tornadoes wildfires sealevel rise due to climate change and other natural disasters at december 31 2021 212 of the gla of our portfolio is located in the state of california including a number of properties in the san francisco bay and los angeles areas additionally 226 and 77 of the gla of our portfolio is located in the states of florida and texas respectively insurance costs for properties in these areas have increased and recent intense weather conditions may cause property insurance premiums to increase significantly in the future we recognize that the frequency and  or intensity of extreme weather events sealevel rise and other climatic changes may continue to increase and as a result our exposure to these events may increase these weather conditions may disrupt our business and the business of our tenants which may affect the ability of some tenants to pay rent and may reduce the willingness of tenants or residents to remain in or move to these affected areas therefore as a result of the geographic concentration of our properties we face risks including disruptions to our business and the businesses of our tenants and higher costs such as uninsured property losses higher insurance premiums and potential additional regulatory requirements by government agencies in response to perceived risks 

costs of environmental remediation may impact our financial performance and reduce our cash flow 

under various federal state and local laws an owner or manager of real property may be liable for the costs to assess and remediate the presence of hazardous substances on the property which in our case most typically arise from current or former dry cleaners gas stations asbestos usage and historic land use practices these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous substances the presence of or the failure to properly address the presence of hazardous substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral we can provide no assurance that we are aware of all potential environmental liabilities or their ultimate cost to address that our properties will not be affected by tenants or nearby properties or other unrelated third parties and that future uses or conditions or changes in environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional material environmental liabilities to us 

  

risk factors related to corporate matters 

an increased focus on metrics and reporting related to environmental social and governance “esg” factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks 

investors have become more focused on understanding how companies address a variety of esg factors as they evaluate investment decisions many investors look not only at company disclosures but also to esg rating systems that have been developed by third parties to allow esg comparisons between companies although we participate in a number of these ratings systems and generally score comparatively well in those in which we do participate we do not participate in all such systems and may not score as well in all of the available ratings systems further the criteria used in these ratings systems may conflict and change frequently and we cannot guaranty that we will be able to score well in the future we supplement our participation in ratings systems with published disclosures of our esg activities but some investors may desire other disclosures that we do not provide in addition the sec is currently evaluating potential rule making that could impose additional esg disclosure and other requirements on us failure to participate in certain of the third party ratings systems failure to score well in those ratings systems or failure to provide certain esg disclosures could result in reputational harm when investors compare us against similar companies in our industry and could cause certain investors to be unwilling to invest in our stock which could adversely impact our ability to raise capital 

an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the insurance coverage on our properties may subject us to loss of capital and revenue on those properties 

we carry comprehensive liability fire flood terrorism business interruption and environmental insurance for our properties some types of losses such as losses from named windstorms earthquakes terrorism or wars may have more limited coverage or in some cases can be excluded from insurance coverage in addition it is possible that the availability of insurance coverage in certain areas may decrease in the future and the cost to procure such insurance may increase due to factors beyond our control we may reduce the insurance we procure as a result of the foregoing or other factors while we believe our coverage is appropriate and adequate to cover our insurable risks should a loss occur at any of our properties that is in excess of the property or casualty insurance limits of our policies we may lose part or all of our invested capital and revenues from such property which may have a material adverse impact on our operating results financial condition and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders 

terrorist activities or violence occurring at our properties also may directly affect the value of our properties through damage destruction or loss insurance for such acts may be unavailable or cost more resulting in an increase to our operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations to the extent that our tenants are affected by such attacks and threats of attacks their businesses may be adversely affected including their ability to continue to meet obligations under their existing leases 

failure to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our business and operations 

the success of our business depends in part on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees and our ability to attract retain and motivate talented and diverse employees may significantly impact our future performance competition for these individuals is intense and we cannot be assured that we will retain all of our executive management team and other key employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals for these positions in the future losing any key personnel may have an adverse effect on us 

the unauthorized access use theft or destruction of tenant or employee personal financial or other data or of regency’s proprietary or confidential information stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues 

many of our information technology systems including those we use for administration accounting and communications as well as the systems of our coinvestment partners and other thirdparty business partners and service providers whether cloudbased or hosted in proprietary servers contain personal financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our tenants and employees many of our information technology systems also contain our proprietary information and other confidential information related to our business we are frequently subject to attempts to compromise our information technology systems to the extent we or a third party were to experience a material breach of our or such third party’s information technology systems that result in the unauthorized access theft use destruction or other compromises of tenants’ or employees data or our confidential information stored in such systems including through cyberattacks or other external or internal methods such a breach may damage our reputation and cause us to lose tenants and revenues incur third party claims and cause disruption to our business and plans additionally a successful ransomware attack denial of service or other impactful type of cyberattack may occur although planning preparation and preventative measures are employed such attacks may be successful and our business may be significantly disrupted if unable to quickly recover such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable us privacy and other laws and subject us to private consumer business partner or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability and we may not be able to recover these expenses from our service providers responsible parties or insurance carriers despite the ongoing significant investments in technology and training we make in cybersecurity we can provide no assurance that we will avoid or prevent such breaches or attacks 

additionally federal state and local authorities continue to develop laws to address data privacy protection monitoring such changes and taking steps to comply involves significant costs and effort by management which may adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 

  

despite the implementation of security measures for our disaster recovery and business continuity plans our systems are vulnerable to damages from multiple sources including computer viruses unauthorized access energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war and telecommunication failure any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business and cause us to incur additional costs to remedy such damages 

risk factors related to our partnerships and joint ventures 

we do not have voting control over all of the properties owned in our coinvestment partnerships and joint ventures so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued 

we have invested substantial capital as a partner in a number of partnerships and joint ventures to acquire own lease develop or redevelop properties these activities are subject to the same risks as our investments in our whollyowned properties these investments and other future similar investments may involve risks that would not be present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or other owners might become bankrupt suffer a deterioration in their creditworthiness or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions partners or other owners may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our own business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives 

these investments and other future similar investments also have the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions such as a sale or financing because neither we nor our partner or other owner has full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or other owners might result in litigation or arbitration that may increase our expenses and prevent management from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or other owners might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we risk the possibility of being liable for the actions of our partners or other owners these factors may limit the return that we receive from such investments or cause our cash flows to be lower than our estimates 

the termination of our partnerships may adversely affect our cash flow operating results and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders 

if partnerships owning a significant number of properties were dissolved for any reason we could lose the asset property management leasing and construction management fees from these partnerships as well as the operating income of the properties which may adversely affect our operating results and our cash available for distribution to stock and unit holders certain of our partnership operating agreements provide either member the ability to elect buysell clauses the election of these dissolution provisions could require us to invest additional capital to acquire the partners’ interest or to sell our share of the property thereby losing the operating income and cash flow 

risk factors related to funding strategies and capital structure 

our ability to sell properties and fund acquisitions and developments may be adversely impacted by higher market capitalization rates and lower noi at our properties which may dilute earnings 

as part of our funding strategy we sell properties that no longer meet our strategic objectives or investment standards andor those with a limited future growth profile these sales proceeds are used to fund debt repayment acquisition of other operating properties and new developments and redevelopments an increase in market capitalization rates or a decline in noi may cause a reduction in the value of centers identified for sale which would have an adverse impact on the amount of cash generated additionally the sale of properties resulting in significant tax gains may require higher distributions to our stockholders or payment of additional income taxes in order to maintain our reit status 

we depend on external sources of capital which may not be available in the future on favorable terms or at all 

to qualify as a reit the parent company must among other things distribute to its stockholders each year at least 90 of its reit taxable income excluding any net capital gains because of these distribution requirements we may not be able to fund all future capital needs with income from operations in such instances we would rely on thirdparty sources of capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all our access to thirdparty sources of capital depends on a number of things including the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings our access to debt depends on our credit rating the willingness of creditors to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets in addition to finding creditors willing to lend to us we are dependent upon our joint venture partners to contribute their pro rata share of any amount needed to repay or refinance existing debt when lenders reduce the amount of debt our partnerships and joint ventures are eligible to refinance 

  

in addition our existing debt arrangements also impose covenants that limit our flexibility in obtaining other financing additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders interests and additional debt financing may substantially increase our degree of leverage 

without access to external sources of capital we would be required to pay outstanding debt with our operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales our operating cash flows may not be sufficient to pay our outstanding debt as it comes due and real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly at a return we believe is appropriate if we are required to deleverage our business with operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales we may be forced to reduce the amount of or eliminate altogether our distributions to stock and unit holders or refrain from making investments in our business 

our debt financing may adversely affect our business and financial condition 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance which to a certain extent is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control in addition we do not expect to generate sufficient operating cash flow to make balloon principal payments on our debt when due if we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms we may be forced i to dispose of properties which might result in losses or ii to obtain financing at unfavorable terms either of which may reduce the cash flow available for distributions to stock and unit holders if we cannot make required mortgage payments the mortgagee may foreclose on the property securing the mortgage 

covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition 

our unsecured notes and unsecured line of credit the “line” contain customary covenants including compliance with financial ratios such as ratio of indebtedness to total asset value and fixed charge coverage ratio these covenants may limit our operational flexibility and our investment activities moreover if we breach any of the covenants in our debt agreements and do not cure the breach within the applicable cure period our lenders may require us to repay the debt immediately even in the absence of a payment default many of our debt arrangements including our unsecured notes and unsecured line of credit are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other material debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants may have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our stock 

increases in interest rates would cause our borrowing costs to rise and negatively impact our results of operations 

although a significant amount of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates we do borrow funds at variable interest rates under our credit facility term loan and certain secured borrowings as of december 31 2021 less than 10 of our outstanding debt was variable rate debt not hedged to fixed rate debt increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense on any variable rate debt to the extent we have not hedged our exposure to changes in interest rates in addition increases in interest rates will affect the terms under which we refinance our existing debt as it matures to the extent we have not hedged our exposure to changes in interest rates this would reduce our future earnings and cash flows which may adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also may reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our stock and unit holders 

hedging activity may expose us to risks including the risks that a counterparty will not perform and that the hedge will not yield the economic benefits we anticipate which may adversely affect us 

we manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements these arrangements involve risk such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements and that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes there can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will qualify for hedge accounting or that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations should we desire to terminate a hedging arrangement there may be significant costs and cash requirements involved to fulfill our obligations under the hedging arrangement in addition failure to effectively hedge against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations 

the interest rates on our unsecured credit facilities as well as on our variable rate mortgages and interest rate swaps might change based on changes to the method in which libor or its replacement rate is determined 

on march 5 2021 the financial conduct authority “fca” announced that usd libor will no longer be published after june 30 2023 this announcement has several implications including setting the spread that may be used to automatically convert contracts from libor to the secured overnight financing rate sofr additionally as of december 31 2021 banks are expected to no longer issue any new libor debt   

we have contracts that are indexed to libor including our 125 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and sixteen mortgages within our consolidated and unconsolidated portfolios totaling 2314 million on a prorata basis as well as interest rate swaps to fix 

  

these variable cash flows with notional amounts totaling 1981 million on a prorata basis these libor based instruments mature between 2022 and 2030 

any changes adopted by the fca or other governing bodies in the method used for determining libor may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported libor if that were to occur our interest payments could adversely change in addition uncertainty about the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates andor payments that are higher or lower than if libor were to remain available in its current form   

we have interest rate swaps that are indexed to libor and are monitoring and evaluating the related risks these risks arise in connection with transitioning contracts to an alternative rate including any resulting value transfer that may occur and are likely to vary by contract the value of loans securities or derivative instruments tied to libor as well as interest rates on our current or future indebtedness may also be adversely impacted if libor is limited or discontinued for some instruments the method of transitioning to an alternative reference rate may be challenging especially if we cannot agree with the respective counterparty about how to make the transition   

while we expect libor to be available in substantially its current form until at least the end of june 30 2023 it is possible that libor will become unavailable prior to that point this could result for example if sufficient banks decline to make submissions to the libor administrator in that case the risks associated with the transition to an alternative reference rate will be accelerated and magnified alternative rates and other market changes related to the replacement of libor including the introduction of financial products and changes in market practices may lead to risk modeling and valuation challenges such as adjusting interest rate accrual calculations and building a term structure for an alternative rate the introduction of an alternative rate may create additional basis risk and increased volatility as alternative rates are phased in and utilized in parallel with libor   

risk factors related to the market price for our securities 

changes in economic and market conditions may adversely affect the market price of our securities 

the market price of our debt and equity securities may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors many of which are out of our control including 

• actual or anticipated variations in our operating results 

• changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates 

• publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry in general and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of other reits 

• the ability of our tenants to pay rent and meet their other obligations to us under current lease terms and our ability to release space as leases expire 

• increases in market interest rates that drive investors in or potential purchasers of our stock to seek other investments or demand a higher dividend yield 

• changes in market valuations of similar companies 

• adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future 

• any future issuances of equity securities 

• additions or departures of key management personnel 

• strategic actions by us or our competitors such as acquisitions or restructurings 

• actions by institutional stockholders 

• reports by corporate governance rating companies 

• increased investor focus on sustainabilityrelated risks including climate change 

• changes in our dividend payments 

  

• potential tax law changes relating to reits 

• speculation in the press or investment community and 

• general market and economic conditions 

these factors may cause the market price of our securities to decline regardless of our financial condition results of operations business or prospects it is impossible to ensure that the market price of our securities including our common stock will not fall in the future a decrease in the market price of our common stock may reduce our ability to raise additional equity in the public markets selling common stock at a decreased market price would have a dilutive impact on existing stockholders 

there is no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates 

our ability to continue to pay dividends at historical rates or to increase our dividend rate will depend on a number of factors including among others the following 

• our financial condition and results of future operations 

• the terms of our loan covenants and 

• our ability to acquire finance develop or redevelop and lease additional properties at attractive rates 

if we do not maintain or periodically increase the dividend on our common stock it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and other securities 

risk factors relating to the company’s qualification as a reit 

if the parent company fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes it would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 

we believe that the parent company qualifies for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes and we plan to operate so that the parent company can continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit if the parent company continues to qualify as a reit it generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders many reit requirements however are highly technical and complex the determination that the parent company is a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances some of which may not be totally within our control and some of which involve questions of interpretation for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income must come from specific passive sources like rent that are itemized in the reit tax laws there can be no assurance that the internal revenue service “irs” or a court would agree with the positions we have taken in interpreting the reit requirements the parent company is also required to distribute to the stockholders at least 90 of its reit taxable income excluding net capital gains the parent company will be subject to us federal income tax on undistributed taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions the parent company pays with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years the fact that we hold many of our assets through coinvestment partnerships and their subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements furthermore congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult for the parent company to remain qualified as a reit 

also unless the irs granted relief under certain statutory provisions the parent company would remain disqualified as a reit for four years following the year it first failed to qualify if the parent company failed to qualify as a reit currently andor with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired the parent company would have to pay significant income taxes reducing cash available to pay dividends which would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to pay any dividends to stockholders in order to maintain our reit status although we believe that the parent company qualifies as a reit we cannot be assured that the parent company will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes 

even if the parent company qualifies as a reit for federal income tax purposes the parent company is required to pay certain federal state and local taxes on its income and property for example if we have net income from “prohibited transactions” that income will be subject to a 100 tax in general prohibited transactions include sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business the determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale while we have undertaken a significant number of asset sales in recent years we do not believe that those sales should be considered prohibited transactions but there can be no assurance that the irs would not contend otherwise 

new legislation as well as new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may be introduced enacted or promulgated from time to time that may change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification in a manner that is adverse to our stockholders 

  

dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates 

subject to limited exceptions dividends paid by reits other than distributions designated as capital gain dividends qualified dividends or returns of capital are not eligible for reduced rates for qualified dividends paid by “c” corporations and are taxable at ordinary income tax rates under the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 “the tcja” however domestic shareholders that are individuals trusts and estates generally may deduct up to 20 of the ordinary dividends eg dividends not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income received from a reit for taxable years beginning after december 3 2017 and before january 1 2026 the impact of the tcja could have adverse tax consequences on certain of our investors by effectively increasing their federal tax rate on dividends paid by reits although these rules do not adversely affect the taxation of reits or dividends payable by reits investors who are individuals trusts and estates may perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which may adversely affect the value of the shares of reits including the per share trading price of the parent companys capital stock 

certain foreign stockholders may be subject to us federal income tax on gain recognized on a disposition of our common stock if we do not qualify as a “domestically controlled” reit 

a foreign person disposing of a us real property interest including shares of a us corporation whose assets consist principally of us real property interests is generally subject to us federal income tax on any gain recognized on the disposition this tax does not apply however to the disposition of stock in a reit if the reit is “domestically controlled” in general the parent company will be a domestically controlled reit if at all times during the fiveyear period ending on the applicable stockholder’s disposition of our stock less than 50 in value of our stock was held directly or indirectly by nonus persons if the parent company were to fail to qualify as a domestically controlled reit gain recognized by a foreign stockholder on a disposition of our common stock would be subject to us federal income tax unless our common stock was traded on an established securities market and the foreign stockholder did not at any time during a specified testing period directly or indirectly own more than 10 of our outstanding common stock 

legislative or other actions affecting reits may have a negative effect on us 

the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us department of the treasury changes to the tax laws with or without retroactive application may adversely affect the parent company or our investors we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect the parent company or our investors new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us there is also a risk that reit status may be adversely impacted by a change in tax or other laws also the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities or an investment in other entities may change making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit 

complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities 

the reit provisions of the code limit our ability to hedge our liabilities generally income from a hedging transaction that constitutes “qualifying income” for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests applicable to reits does not constitute “gross income” for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests provided that we properly identify the hedging transaction pursuant to the applicable sections of the code and treasury regulations to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions or fail to make the proper tax identifications the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests as a result of these rules we may need to limit our use of otherwise advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a taxable reit subsidiary “trs” 

risk factors related to the company’s common stock 

restrictions on the ownership of the parent company’s capital stock to preserve its reit status may delay or prevent a change in control

during 2022 we have a total of 1072 leases expiring representing 34 million square feet of gla these expiring leases have an average base rent of 2382 psf the average base rent of new leases signed during 2021 was 2891 psf during periods of economic weakness or when percent leased is low tenants have more bargaining power which may result in rental rate declines on new or renewal leases in periods of recovery andor when percent leased levels are high landlords have more bargaining power which generally results in rental rate growth on new and renewal leases 

during 2020 as the longterm economic effects of the pandemic were uncertain new leasing activity declined as many businesses delayed executing leases this trend reversed during 2021 as new and renewal activity increased as the economy began to recover demand for retail space in high quality community centers located in areas with compelling demographics remains strong especially among successful business operators and growing innovative business concepts however evolving inflationary challenges could result in pressure on base rent growth for new and renewal leases as businesses seek to manage costs

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

covid19 pandemic 

for a discussion of the covid19 pandemic refer to part i item 1 business 

executing on our strategy 

during the year ended december 31 2021 we had net income attributable to common stockholders of 3614 million as compared to 449 million during the year ended december 31 2020 as the impact of reopening following pandemic restrictions brought significant customer traffic back to our shopping centers the year ended december 31 2020 includes the impacts of a 1321 million goodwill impairment charge and 1170 million of uncollectible lease income primarily as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

during the year ended december 31 2021 

• our prorata same property noi excluding termination fees grew 162 primarily attributable to collections of previously reserved rent and improvements in current period collection rates although rates continue to remain below prepandemic levels they have improved to 99 for the three months ended december 31 2021 as of february 7 2022 

• we executed 1979 new and renewal leasing transactions representing 70 million prorata sf with positive trailing twelve month rent spreads of 55 during 2021 as compared to 1511 leasing transactions representing 58 million prorata sf with positive trailing twelve month rent spreads of 22 in 2020 rent spreads are calculated on all executed leasing transactions for comparable retail operating property spaces including spaces vacant greater than 12 months 

• at december 31 2021 our total property portfolio was 941 leased while our same property portfolio was 943 leased as compared to 923 leased and 929 leased respectively at december 31 2020 

we continued our development and redevelopment of high quality shopping centers 

• estimated prorata project costs of our current in process development and redevelopment projects totaled 3073 million as compared to 3193 million at december 31 2020 

• development and redevelopment projects completed during 2021 represent 676 million of estimated net project costs with an average stabilized yield of 90 

we maintained a conservative balance sheet providing liquidity and financial flexibility to cost effectively fund investment opportunities and debt maturities 

• on january 15 2021 we repaid our 265 million term loan leaving us with no unsecured debt maturities until 2024 

• on february 9 2021 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement which among other items i maintains our previous level of borrowing capacity of 125 billion ii includes a 125 million sublimit for swingline loans and 50 million available for issuance of letters of credit iii extends the maturity date to march 23 2025 and iv provides for two sixmonth extension options the existing financial covenants under the line remained unchanged as of december 31 2021 our borrowing capacity under the line was 12 billion with no borrowings outstanding 

• during may and june 2021 we entered into forward sale agreements under our atm program through which we can issue 2316760 shares of our common stock at an average offering price of 6459 before underwriting discount and offering expenses 

o during september 2021 we settled and issued 1332142 shares under such forward sale agreements at a weighted average price of 6371 before underwriting discounts and offering expenses net proceeds received at settlement were approximately 825 million which were used to fund the acquisition of usaas partnership interest in a seven property portfolio 

o the remaining unsettled shares under the forward sale agreements must be settled within one year of their trade dates which range from june 6 2022 to june 11 2022 proceeds from the remaining issuance of shares are expected to be approximately 65 million before underwriting discounts and offering expenses and will be used to fund new investments which may include acquisitions of operating properties developments and redevelopments or for general corporate purposes 

  

• at december 31 2021 our prorata net debttooperating ebitda re ratio on a trailing twelve month basis was 51x as compared to 60x at december 31 2020 

leasing activity and significant tenants 

we believe our highquality grocery anchored shopping centers located in suburban trade areas with compelling demographics create attractive spaces for retail and service providers to operate their businesses 

prorata percent leased 

the following table summarizes prorata percent leased of our combined consolidated and unconsolidated shopping center portfolio 

  

 our percent leased in both the anchor and shop space categories increased primarily due to leasing activity during 2021 this resulted from greater demand for space and confidence among existing tenants as their businesses recovered from the initial impacts of the pandemic in 2020 during which we experienced greater tenant closures and bankruptcies 

prorata leasing activity 

the following table summarizes leasing activity including our prorata share of activity within the portfolio of our coinvestment partnerships 

  

   

 the weighted average base rent per square foot on signed shop space leases during 2021 was 3433 psf which is higher than the weighted average annual base rent per square foot of all shop space leases due to expire during the next 12 months of 3293 psf new and renewal rent spreads as compared to prior rents on these same spaces leased were positive at 55 for the twelve months ended december 31 2021 as compared to 22 for the twelve months ended december 31 2020 

  

while new and renewal rent spreads were positive during 2021 a worsening of the current economic environment could suppress demand for space in our centers which may result in pricing pressure on rents further we could see higher rates for tenant build outs as costs of materials are increasing as labor and supply availability are decreasing 

significant tenants and concentrations of risk 

we seek to reduce our operating and leasing risks through geographic diversification as seen in our properties tables in item 2 we avoid dependence on any single property market or tenant based on percentage of annualized base rent the following table summarizes our most significant tenants of which four of the top five are grocers 

  

 1 includes regencys prorata share of unconsolidated properties and excludes those owned by anchors 

bankruptcies and credit concerns 

the impact of bankruptcies may increase significantly if tenants occupying our centers are unable to recover as a result of the continuing challenges from the covid19 pandemic which could materially adversely impact lease income during 2021 the number of tenants filing for bankruptcy declined compared to 2020 with a number of tenants emerging from bankruptcy after reorganization however the potential severity of future variants of covid19 the challenges of operating with mask and vaccine mandates combined with the impacts of inflation labor shortages and supply chain disruptions may adversely impact our tenants 

although base rent is supported by longterm lease contracts tenants who file bankruptcy generally have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant for unpaid rent might be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold additionally we may incur significant expense to adjudicate our claim and to release the vacated space in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues 

our management team devotes significant time to researching and monitoring retail trends consumer preferences customer shopping behaviors changes in retail delivery methods shifts to ecommerce and changing demographics in order to anticipate the challenges and opportunities impacting the retail industry as the economy recovers from the effects of the ongoing pandemic our tenants may be adversely impacted by challenges such as rising costs labor shortages supply chain constraints and reduced instore sales which could have an adverse effect on our results from operations we seek to mitigate these potential impacts through tenant diversification replacing weaker tenants with stronger operators anchoring our centers with market leading grocery stores that drive customer traffic and maintaining a presence in suburban trade areas with compelling demographic populations benefitting from high levels of disposal income 

the covid19 pandemic resulted in many tenants requesting concessions from rent obligations particularly during 2020 primarily in the form of deferrals and to a lesser extent abatements and requests to negotiate future rents see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on deferrals there can be no assurances that all such deferred rent will ultimately be collected or collected within the timeframes agreed upon whether vaccination rates will continue to rise whether state and local authorities impose new mandated closures or capacity restrictions and whether current vaccines prove to be effective against variants of the covid19 virus will influence the success of our tenants and their ability to pay us rent 

  

results from operations 

although inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers inflation has recently increased in the united states while the united states economy continues to recover from the effects of the covid19 pandemic ongoing changes in economic conditions such as labor shortages employee retention costs increased material and shipping costs and supply chain constraints have spurred a rise in wages and increased operating costs and challenges for our tenants and us 

substantially all of our longterm leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on our operating centers by requiring tenants to pay their prorata share of operating expenses including commonarea maintenance real estate taxes insurance and utilities over half of our leases are for terms of less than ten years primarily within shop space which permits us to seek increased rents upon rerental at market rates however our ability to pass through increases in our operating expenses to our tenants is dependent on the tenants ability to absorb and pay these increases additionally increases in operating expenses passed through to our tenants without a corresponding increase in our tenants profitability may place pressure on our ability to grow base rent as tenants look to manage their total occupancy costs 

comparison of the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 

our revenues changed as summarized in the following table 

  

 lease income increased 1332 million driven by the following contractually billable components of rent to the tenants per the lease agreements 

• 1059 million increase from favorable changes in uncollectible lease income 

o during 2021 uncollectible lease income was a net positive 235 million driven by 420 m illion collection of prior year reserves on cash basis tenants partially offset by 185 m illion reserve recognition on current year billings 

o during 2020 uncollectible lease income was a net charge of 824 million driven by reserves recognized on cash basis tenants due to lower cash collections during the pandemic 

o while we expect collections to remain below prepandemic levels over the next year we continue to experience improvements in our collection rates approximatel y 99 of the base rent billed for the three months ended december 31 2021 has been collected through february 7 2022 

• 371 million increase in straightline rent from less uncollectible straightline rent in 2021 due to fewer new cash basis tenants identified as compared to 2020 as well as reestablishin g 114 million in st raightline rent receivable related to certain tenants converting back to accrual basis as we consider collections from them to be probable 

• 117 million increase from contractual recoveries from tenants which represents the tenants prorata share of the operating maintenance insurance and real estate tax expenses that we incur to operate our shopping centers recoveries from tenants increased on a net basis primarily from the following 

o 126 million net increase from same properties due to higher operating costs in the current year and greater recovery of those expenses from tenants and 

o 12 million increase from rent commencing at development properties and acquisitions of operating properties offset by 

o 21 million decrease from the sale of operating properties 

• 21 million increase in other lease income primarily from an increase in termination and easement fees temporary tenants and income from electric vehicle charging stations 

• 438000 increase in percentage rent due to improved tenant sales as pandemic restrictions eased 

• 177 million decrease in above and below market rent primarily from same properties driven by 2020 tenant moveouts and the timing of lease term modifications 

  

• 63 million decrease from billable base rent as follows 

o 89 million decrease from the sale of operating properties offset by 

o 11 million increase from acquisitions of operating properties 

o 945000 increase from rent commencing at development properties and 

o 476000 net increase from same properties particularly from a 54 million increase related to our consolidation of the seven properties previously held in the usaa partnership offset by a 49 million net decrease in the remaining same properties due to loss of rents from tenant moveouts and deferral agreements that required lease modification treatment 

other property income increased 29 million primarily due to an increase in settlements 

management transaction and other fees increased 138 million from promote income recognized for exceeding return thresholds for our performance as managing member of the usaa partnership 

changes in our operating expenses are summarized in the following table 

  

 depreciation and amortization costs changed as follows 

• 408 million decrease primarily attributable to 

o 130 million decrease related to various acquired lease intangibles becoming fully amortized 

o 136 million decrease related to higher early tenant moveouts recognized in 2020 and 

o 142 million decrease primarily attributable to higher depreciation in 2020 related to development and redevelopment projects 

• 26 million decrease from the sale of operating properties offset by 

• 847000 increase from acquisitions of operating properties and corporate assets 

operating and maintenance costs increased on a net basis as follows 

• 25 million net increase from acquisitions of operating properties and development properties and 

• 125 million net increase from same properties primarily attributable to higher insurance premiums utility costs and general property maintenance as our centers return to normal operating levels offset by 

• 518000 decrease from the sale of operating properties 

general and administrative costs increased on a net basis as follows 

• 40 million net increase in compensation costs primarily driven by performance based incentives offset by 

• 10 million decrease due to higher development overhead capitalization based on the status and progress of development and redevelopment projects during the year 

• we expect travel and entertainment costs to increase as we return to more normal operations additionally we may continue to see increases in compensation costs and general corporate overhead due to inflation labor shortages and the related cost of retaining our employee base 

  

other operating expenses decreased 69 million primarily due to lower development pursuit costs 

the following table presents the components of other expense income 

  

 the 115 million net decrease in total interest expense is primarily due to 

• 78 million decrease in interest on unsecured credit facilities primarily related to the january 2021 repayment of the 265 million term loan and a lower average outstanding balance on the line 

• 932000 net decrease in interest on notes payable from the payoff of 300 million of senior unsecured notes in september 2020 together with the repayment of several mortgages offset by the issuance of 600 million of senior unsecured notes in may 2020 and 

• 39 million decrease in hedge expense as previously settled swaps hedging our tenyear notes fully amortized in 2020 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we recognized 1321 million of goodwill impairment due to the significant adverse market and economic impacts of the covid19 pandemic 

during 2021 we recognized 844 million of impairment losses resulting from the impairment of two operating properties during 2020 we recognized 185 million of impairment losses resulting from the impairment of two operating properties and one land parcel 

during 2021 we recognized gains of 911 million from the sale of five land parcels and six operating properties during 2020 we recognized gains of 675 million from the sale of ten land parcels five operating properties and receipt of property insurance proceeds 

during 2020 we incurred 218 million of debt extinguishment costs of which 194 million related to the early redemption of our unsecured notes due to mature in 2022 and a 24 million charge for termination of an interest rate swap on our term loan that was repaid in january 2021 

our equity in income losses of investments in real estate partnerships changed as follows 

  

 1 we acquired our partner’s 80 interest in the seven properties held in the usaa partnership on august 1 2021 therefore results following the date of acquisition are included in consolidated results 

  

the 129 million increase in our equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships is largely attributable to favorable uncollectible lease income along with reinstating straightline rent on certain tenants returning to accrual basis during the year including the following 

• 92 million increase within grir primarily due to continued improvement in tenant rent collections and 

• 99 million increase within columbia ii primarily due to an 89 million prorata gain on sale of one operating property offset by 

• 84 million decrease within other investments in real estate partnerships from a 92 million impairment of a single property partnership which sold in august offset by continued improvement in tenant rent collections at the remaining partnerships properties 

the following represents the remaining components that comprise net income attributable to the common stockholders and unit holders

supplemental earnings information 

we use certain nongaap performance measures in addition to certain performance metrics determined under gaap as we believe these measures improve the understanding of our operating results we believe these nongaap measures provide useful information to our board of directors management and investors regarding certain trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations our management uses these nongaap measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses purposes of determining management incentive compensation and budgeting forecasting and planning purposes we provide prorata financial information because we believe it assists investors and analysts in estimating our economic interest in our consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships when read in conjunction with our reported results under gaap we believe presenting our prorata share of operating results along with other nongaap measures may assist in comparing our operating results to other reits we continually evaluate the usefulness relevance limitations and calculation of our reported nongaap performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public and thus such reported measures could change see “defined terms” in part i item 1 

we do not consider nongaap measures an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with gaap rather they supplement gaap measures by providing additional information we believe to be useful to shareholders the principal limitation of these nongaap financial measures is they may exclude significant expense and income items that are required by gaap to be recognized in our consolidated financial statements in addition they reflect the exercise of management’s judgment about which expense and income items are excluded or included in determining these nongaap financial measures in order to compensate for these limitations reconciliations of the nongaap financial measures we use to their most directly comparable gaap measures are provided nongaap financial measures should not be relied upon in evaluating our financial condition results of operations or future prospects

liquidity and capital resources 

general 

we use cash flows generated from operating investing and financing activities to strengthen our balance sheet finance our development and redevelopment projects fund our investment activities and maintain financial flexibility a significant portion of our cash from operations is distributed to our common shareholders in the form of dividends in order to maintain our status as a reit 

except for 200 million of private placement debt our parent company has no capital commitments other than its guarantees of the commitments of our operating partnership all remaining debt is held by our operating partnership or by our coinvestment partnerships the operating partnership is a coissuer and a guarantor of the 200 million of outstanding debt of our parent company the parent company will from time to time access the capital markets for the purpose of issuing new equity and will simultaneously contribute all of the offering proceeds to the operating partnership in exchange for additional partnership units 

we continually assess our available liquidity and our expected cash uses which includes monitoring our tenant rent collections our rent collection experience during the pandemic has been lower than historical prepandemic averages but has substantially improved during 2021 as compared to its low in the second quarter of 2020 during the three months ended december 31 2021 billed base rent collections were 99 as of february 7 2022 although having improved significantly collection rates are expected to remain lower than historical prepandemic averages for the next twelve months 

the success of our tenants and their ability to pay rent continues to be significantly influenced by many challenges including rising costs labor shortages supply chain constraints reduced sales store closures capacity restrictions and ongoing variants of covid19 

we draw on multiple financing sources to fund our longterm capital needs including the capital requirements of our in process and planned developments redevelopments capital expenditures and the repayment of debt we expect to meet these needs by using a combination of the following cash flow from operations after funding our dividend proceeds from the sale of real estate mortgage loan and unsecured bank financing distributions received from our coinvestment partnerships and when the capital markets are favorable proceeds from the sale of equity or the issuance of new unsecured debt we continually evaluate alternative financing options and we believe we can obtain financing on reasonable terms 

we have no unsecured debt maturities until 2024 and a manageable level of secured mortgage maturities during the next 12 months including those mortgages within our real estate partnerships based upon our available cash balance sources of capital our current credit ratings and the number of high quality unencumbered properties we own we believe our available capital resources are sufficient to meet our expected capital needs for the next year 

in addition to our 931 million of unrestricted cash we have the following additional sources of capital available 

  

 1 during may and june 2021 we entered into forward sales agreements with respect to 2316760 shares that were executed in several tranches at a weighted average offering price of 6459 per share before any underwriting discount and offering expenses during september 2021 we settled 1332142 of the shares subject to forward sales agreements receiving proceeds of 825 million the remaining shares subject to forward sales agreements must be settled within approximately one year of their trade dates which vary by agreement and range from june 6 2022 through june 11 2022 and are expected to result in net proceeds of approximately 65 million

the declaration of dividends is determined quarterly by our board of directors on february 9 2022 our board of directors declared a common stock dividend of 0625 per share payable on april 5 2022 to shareholders of record as of march 15 2022 while future dividends will be determined at the discretion of our board of directors we plan to continue paying an aggregate amount of distributions to our stock and unit holders that at a minimum meet the requirements to continue qualifying as a reit for federal income tax purposes we have historically generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our dividend distributions during 

  

the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 we generated cash flow from operations of 6594 million and 4991 million respectively and paid 4049 million and 3019 million in dividends to our common stock and unit holders respectively 

we currently have development and redevelopment projects in various stages of construction along with a pipeline of potential projects for future development or redevelopment after funding our common stock dividend payment in january 2022 we estimate that we will require capital during the next twelve months of approximately 3685 million this required capital includes funding construction and related costs for leasing commissions and committed tenant improvements and inprocess developments and redevelopments making capital contributions to our coinvestment partnerships and repaying maturing debt 

if we start new developments or redevelopments commit to property acquisitions repay debt prior to maturity declare future dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock our cash requirements will increase if we refinance maturing debt our cash requirements will decrease we expect to generate the necessary cash to fund our longterm capital needs from cash flow from operations borrowings from our line proceeds from the sale of real estate mortgage loan and unsecured bank financing and when the capital markets are favorable proceeds from the sale of equity or the issuance of new unsecured debt 

we endeavor to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets as of december 31 2021 894 of our whollyowned real estate assets were unencumbered such assets allow us to access the secured and unsecured debt markets and to maintain availability on the line our trailing twelve month fixed charge coverage ratio including our prorata share of our partnerships was 45x and 36x for the periods ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively and our prorata net debttooperating ebitda re ratio on a trailing twelve month basis was 51x and 60x respectively for the same periods 

our line and unsecured debt require that we remain in compliance with various covenants which are described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements we are in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2021 and expect to remain in compliance 

summary of cash flow activity 

the following table summarizes net cash flows related to operating investing and financing activities of the company

• we paid 3921 million to purchase twelve operating properties during 2021 including seven properties in which we previously held a 20 interest we paid 168 million for the acquisition of one property during 2020 

• we invested 32 million less in 2021 than 2020 in real estate development redevelopment and capital improvements as further detailed in the tables below 

• we received proceeds of 2062 million from the sale of seven shopping centers and five land parcels in 2021 compared to 1894 million for six shopping centers and eleven land parcels in 2020 

• we received property insurance claim proceeds of 80 million during 2020 primarily related to a single property damaged by a tornado in 2020 and additional proceeds received on prior year fire and tornado claims 

• we invested 235 million in our real estate partnerships during 2021 including 

o 187 million to fund our share of debt refinancing activities 

o 48 million to fund our share of development and redevelopment activities 

during the same period in 2020 we invested 514 million in our real estate partnerships including 

o 196 million to fund our share of development and redevelopment activities 

o 160 million to fund our share of acquiring an additional equity interest in one partnership and 

o 158 million to fund our share of debt refinancing activities

• acquisition of securities and proceeds from sale of securities pertain to investment activities held in our captive insurance company and our deferred compensation plan 

  

we plan to continue developing and redeveloping shopping centers for longterm investment during 2021 we deployed capital of 1776 million for the development redevelopment and improvement of our real estate properties comprised of the following 

  

 • land acquisitions increased 118 million primarily driven by the purchase of land formerly held under ground leases at two of our existing centers 

• building and tenant improvements increased 69 million during the year ended december 31 2021 primarily related to the timing of capital projects 

• redevelopment expenditures were lower during 2021 due to the timing and magnitude of projects in process we intend to continuously improve our portfolio of shopping centers through redevelopment which can include adjacent land acquisition existing building expansion facade renovation new outparcel building construction and redevelopment related tenant improvement costs the size and magnitude of each redevelopment project varies with each redevelopment plan the timing and duration of these projects could also result in volatility in noi see the tables below for more details about our redevelopment projects 

• development expenditures remained consistent based on the timing and magnitude of our development projects currently in process see the tables below for more details about our development projects 

• interest is capitalized on our development and redevelopment projects and is based on cumulative actual costs expended we cease interest capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements but in no event would we capitalize interest on the project beyond twelve months after the anchor opens for business if we reduce our development and redevelopment activity the amount of interest that we capitalize may be lower than historical averages 

• we have a staff of employees who directly support our development program which includes redevelopment of our existing properties internal compensation costs directly attributable to these activities are capitalized as part of each project we currently expect that our development and redevelopment activities will approximate our recent historical averages although the amount of activity will vary by type reduction in the level of future development activity could adversely impact results of operations by reducing the amount of internal costs for development or redevelopment activity without a corresponding reduction in compensation costs 

the following table summarizes our development projects inprocess and completed 

  

 1 estimated stabilization year represents the estimated first full calendar year that the project will reach our expected stabilized yield 

2 includes leasing costs and is net of tenant reimbursements 

3 estimated net development costs and gla reported based on regency’s ownership interest in the partnership at completion 

  

4 estimated net development costs for baybrook east 1a is limited to our ownership interest in the value of land and site improvements to deliver a parcel to a grocer under a ground lease agreement to construct their building and improvements this property is included in our investments in real estate partnerships

critical accounting estimates 

knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial statements the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities as of a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period these accounting estimates are based upon but not limited to our judgments about historical and expected future results current market conditions and interpretation of industry accounting standards they are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness however the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates 

  

collectibility of lease income 

lease income which includes base rent percentage rent and recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs insurance and real estate taxes are the companys principal source of revenue as a result of generating this revenue we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants 

lease income for operating leases with fixed payment terms is recognized on a straightline basis over the expected term of the lease for all leases for which collectibility is considered probable at the commencement date at lease commencement the company generally expects that collectibility is probable due to the company’s credit assessment of tenants and other creditworthiness analysis undertaken before entering into a new lease therefore income from most operating leases is initially recognized on a straightline basis for operating leases in which collectibility of lease income is not considered probable lease income is recognized on a cash basis and all previously recognized and uncollected lease income is reversed in the period in which the lease income is determined not to be probable of collection in addition to the leasespecific collectibility assessment the company may recognize a general reserve as a reduction to lease income for its portfolio of operating lease receivables which are not expected to be fully collectible based on the company’s historical collection experience although we estimate uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income actual experience may differ from those estimates 

real estate investments 

acquisition of real estate investments 

upon acquisition of real estate operating properties the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land building building improvements and tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and belowmarket leases and inplace leases assumed debt and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date based on these estimates the company allocates the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities transaction costs associated with asset acquisitions are capitalized while such costs are expensed for business combinations in the period incurred the acquisition of operating properties are generally considered asset acquisitions if however the acquisition is determined to be a business combination any excess consideration above the fair value allocated to the applicable assets and liabilities results in goodwill fair value is determined based on an exit price approach which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 

the companys methodology for determining fair value of the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities includes estimating an “asif vacant” fair value of the physical property which includes land building and improvements in addition the company determines the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets and liabilities considering the following categories i value of inplace leases and ii above and belowmarket value of inplace leases 

the value of inplace leases is estimated based on the value associated with the costs avoided in originating leases compared to the acquired inplace leases as well as the value associated with lost rental and recovery revenue during the assumed leaseup period the value of inplace leases is recorded to depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the remaining expected term of the respective leases 

abovemarket and belowmarket inplace lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the inplace leases and ii managements estimate of fair market lease rates for comparable inplace leases measured over a period equal to the remaining noncancelable term of the lease including belowmarket renewal options if applicable the value of abovemarket leases is amortized as a reduction of lease income over the remaining terms of the respective leases and the value of belowmarket leases is accreted to lease income over the remaining terms of the respective leases including belowmarket renewal options if applicable 

changes to these assumptions could result in a different pattern of recognition if tenants do not remain in their lease through the expected term or exercise an assumed renewal option there could be a material impact to earnings 

valuation of real estate investments 

in accordance with gaap we evaluate our real estate for impairment whenever there are events or changes in circumstances including property operating performance general market conditions or changes in expected hold periods that indicate that the carrying value of our real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may not be recoverable if such events or changes occur we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions including rental rates expected leasing activity costs of tenant improvements leasing commissions expected hold period comparable sales information and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition including the exit capitalization rate these key assumptions are subjective in nature and the resulting impairment if any could differ from the actual gain or loss recognized upon ultimate sale in an arms length transaction if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value 

the estimated fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is estimated through comparable sales information and other market data if available as well as the use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the discounted cash flow approach 

  

the discounted cash flow method uses similar assumptions to the undiscounted cash flow method above as well as a discount rate such cash flow projections and rates are subject to management judgment and changes in those assumptions could impact the estimation of fair value in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land we generally use market data and comparable sales information changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the expected hold period of an asset or asset group which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the companys financial condition or operating performance 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 to consolidated financial statements 

environmental matters 

we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining primarily to specific chemicals historically used by certain current and former dry cleaning and gas station tenants and the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers we believe that the few tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations generally we endeavor to require tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to more environmentally friendly systems in accordance with the terms of our leases we have a blanket environmental insurance policy for thirdparty liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination we have also secured environmental insurance policies where appropriate on a relatively small number of specific properties with known contamination in order to mitigate our environmental risk we monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites we also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so 

as of december 31 2021 we had accrued liabilities of 90 million for our prorata share of environmental remediation including our investments in real estate partnerships we believe that the ultimate remediation of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental contamination that our estimate of liabilities will not change as more information becomes available that any previous owner occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants by the condition of nearby properties or by unrelated third parties or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualita tive disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to two significant components of interest rate risk 

• we have a line commitment as further described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements which has a variable interest rate that as of december 31 2021 is based upon an annual rate of libor plus 0875 libor rates charged on our line change monthly and the spread on the line is dependent upon maintaining specific credit ratings if our credit ratings are downgraded the spread on the line would increase resulting in higher interest costs the interest rate spread based on our credit rating ranges from libor plus 0700 to libor plus 1550 

• we are also exposed to changes in interest rates when we refinance our existing longterm fixed rate debt the objective of our interest rate risk management program is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows to achieve these objectives we borrow primarily at fixed interest rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps caps or treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes our interest rate swaps are structured solely for the purpose of interest rate protection 

we continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt to repay maturing debt or fund our commitments although the capital markets have experienced volatility related to the pandemic we continue to believe in light of our credit ratings the capacity under our unsecured credit facility and the number of high quality unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings we will be able to successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund maturing debt obligations however the degree to which such capital market volatility will adversely impact the interest rates on any new debt that we may issue is uncertain 

our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the table below presents the principal cash flows weighted average interest rates of remaining debt and the fair value of total debt as of december 31 2021 for variable rate mortgages and unsecured credit facilities for which we have interest rate swaps in place to fix the interest rate they are included in the fixed rate debt section below at their allin fixed rate the table is presented by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes although the average interest rate for variable rate debt is included in the table those rates represent rates that 

  

existed as of december 31 2021 and are subject to change on a monthly basis in addition the company continually assesses the market risk for its floating rate debt and believes that a 1 increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 50000 per year based on 50 million of floating rate mortgage debt outstanding at december 31 2021 if the company increases its line of credit balance in the future additional decreases to future earnings and cash flows could occur 

further the table below incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2021 and does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date or obligations repaid before maturity since firm commitments are not presented the table has limited predictive value as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at that time and actual interest rates 

the table below presents the principal cash flow payments associated with our outstanding debt by year weighted average interest rates on debt outstanding at each yearend and fair value of total debt as of december 31 2021 

 

 1 reflects amount of debt maturities during each of the years presented as of december 31 2021 

2 reflects weighted average interest rates of debt outstanding at the end of each year presented for variable rate debt the benchmark interest rate libor as of december 31 2021 was used to determine the average rate for all future periods

covid19 pandemic

on march 11 2020 the novel coronavirus disease “covid19” was declared a pandemic “covid19 pandemic” or the “pandemic” by the world health organization as the disease spread throughout the world the pandemic continues to evolve making the broader implications on our future results of operations and overall financial performance uncertain at this time while much of our lease income is derived from contractual rent payments our tenants’ ability to meet their lease obligations has been negatively impacted by the disruptions and uncertainties of the pandemic certain of our tenants’ ability to respond to these disruptions including adapting to governmental orders recommendations and changes in their customers’ shopping habits and behaviors could influence their ability to survive and ultimately fulfill their lease obligations while the announcement of vaccine approvals by the us food and drug administration “fda” in early december 2020 was a positive development at about the same time several states and many localities reinstituted mandatory business limitations and closures as infection rates increased in advance of full scale vaccine deployment forced closures may continue to occur as infection rates increase or additional strains of the virus emerge while the speed of vaccine rollout remains uncertain 

due to the pandemic certain tenants have requested rent concessions or have sought to renegotiate future rents based on changes to the economic environment other tenants have chosen not to reopen or honor the terms of their existing lease agreements in addition in 2020 we saw a meaningful increase in the number of bankruptcy filings by our tenants versus prior years which in certain cases can lead to a tenant “rejecting” terminating one or more of our leases as permitted by applicable bankruptcy law or seeking to negotiate reduced rent as part of the bankruptcy reorganization process 

we are closely monitoring our rent collections from our tenants which significantly declined from historic levels at the start of the pandemic but have since gradually improved as of february 8 2021 we experienced sequential improvement in our collection rates of prorata base rent billed by quarter in 2020 as follows



since the pandemic began we have executed approximately 1600 rent deferral agreements within our consolidated and unconsolidated real estate portfolios the weighted average deferral period of these agreements is approximately 33 months with repayment periods of approximately 97 months beginning on average in december 2020 in some cases we expect to continue to work with tenants to address the adverse impacts of the pandemic which may result in further rent deferrals concessions or abatements as a result there can be no assurance that our future base rent collection percentages will continue at or above q4 2020 levels or that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to sustain and fund our dividend payments without the benefit of other sources of capital or changes to our current dividend levels in the event of a surge in covid19 cases or new governmental restrictions causing our tenants to reduce their operations or close our base rent collection percentages and percent leased could decline from current levels 

new leasing activity declined in 2020 and is expected to remain below 2019 levels into 2021 as businesses delay executing leases amidst the immediate and uncertain future economic impacts of the pandemic this coupled with tenant failures and bankruptcies may result in decreased demand for retail space in our centers which could result in difficulty attracting new tenants resulting in pricing pressure on rents additionally if construction of tenant improvements are delayed due to the impacts of the pandemic it may take longer before new tenants are able to open and commence rent payments

the pandemic has significantly slowed and in certain situations delayed tenant buildouts new ground up developments or redevelopment of existing properties the pandemic has also limited our ability to timely source materials for construction and has caused labor shortages which have impacted our ability to complete construction projects on anticipated schedules in the event a surge in new cases resulting in additional lockdowns occurs similar impacts to our supply chain may arise which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we continue to closely monitor our projects which has resulted in prudently delaying phasing or curtailing certain of our development redevelopment and capital expenditure projects

 

the duration and severity of the pandemic across the united states will continue to negatively impact many of our tenants and their ability to meet their rent obligations under their lease agreements as such the pandemic could continue to negatively impact our r esults of operations and overall financial condition in the future  see also part i  item 1a risk factors for further discussion 

our business continuity and disaster recovery plan enabled us to continue operating productively during the pandemic we have maintained and expect to continue to maintain without interruption our financial reporting systems as well as our internal controls over our financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures 

competition

we are among the largest owners of shopping centers in the nation based on revenues number of properties gla and market capitalization there are numerous companies and individuals engaged in the ownership development acquisition and operation of shopping centers that compete with us in our targeted markets including grocery store chains that also anchor some of our shopping centers this results in competition for attracting tenants as well as the acquisition of existing shopping centers and new development sites in addition brick and mortar shopping centers in general face continued competition from alternative shopping and delivery methods including ecommerce and home delivery we believe that our competitive advantages are driven by

annual meeting of shareholders

our 2021 annual meeting of shareholders is currently expected to be held on wednesday may 5 2021 in light of public health concerns related to the covid19 pandemic and to help protect the safety of our shareholders directors employees and other participants the company’s annual meeting will be conducted in a virtualonly format 

defined terms 

in addition to the required generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” presentations we use certain nongaap performance measures as we believe these measures improve the understanding of the companys operational results we believe these nongaap measures provide useful information to our board of directors management and investors regarding certain trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations our management uses these nongaap measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses purposes of determining management incentive compensation and budgeting forecasting and planning 

 

purposes we continually evaluate the usefulness relevance limitations and calculation of our reported nongaap performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public and thus such reported measures could change 

we do not consider nongaap measures an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with gaap rather they supplement gaap measures by providing additional information we believe to be useful to our shareholders the principal limitation of these nongaap financial measures is they may exclude significant expense and income items that are required by gaap to be recognized in our consolidated financial statements in addition they reflect the exercise of management’s judgment about which expense and income items are excluded or included in determining these nongaap financial measures in order to compensate for these limitations reconciliations of the nongaap financial measures we use to their most directly comparable gaap measures are provided nongaap financial measures should not be relied upon in evaluating the financial condition results of operations or future prospects of the company

the following terms as defined are commonly used by management and the investing public to understand and evaluate our operational results









companies use different depreciable lives and methods and real estate values historically fluctuate with market conditions since nareit ffo excludes depreciation and amortization and gains on sale and impairments of real estate it provides a performance measure that when compared year over year reflects the impact on operations from trends in percent leased rental rates operating costs acquisition and development activities and financing costs this provides a perspective of our financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with gaap thus nareit ffo is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of our operating performance which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered a substitute measure of cash flows from operations we provide a reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders to nareit ffo







 



we provide prorata financial information because we believe it assists investors and analysts in estimating our economic interest in our consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships when read in conjunction with the company’s reported results under gaap we believe presenting our prorata share of assets liabilities operating results and other metrics along with certain other nongaap measures makes comparisons of other reits’ operating results to ours more meaningful the prorata information provided is not nor is it intended to be presented in accordance with gaap the prorata supplemental details of assets and liabilities and supplemental details of operations reflect our proportionate economic ownership of the assets liabilities and operating results of the properties in our portfolio

the prorata information is prepared on a basis consistent with the comparable consolidated amounts and is intended to more accurately reflect our proportionate economic interest in the assets liabilities and operating results of properties in our portfolio we do not control the unconsolidated investment partnerships and the prorata presentations of the assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses do not represent our legal claim to such items the partners are entitled to profit or loss allocations and distributions of cash flows according to the operating agreements which generally provide for such allocations according to their invested capital our share of invested capital establishes the ownership interests we use to prepare our prorata share

the presentation of prorata information has limitations which include but are not limited to the following





because of these limitations the prorata financial information should not be considered independently or as a substitute for our financial statements as reported under gaap we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap financial statements using the prorata information as a supplement









 

 




 item 1a risk factors

our operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those listed below when considering an investment in our securities carefully read and consider these risks together with all other information in our other filings and submissions to the sec which provide much more information and detail if any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occur our business financial condition and or operating results as well as the market price of our securities could be materially adversely affected 

 

risk factors related to the covid19 pandemic 

 

pandemics or other health crises such as the pandemic may adversely affect our tenants’ financial condition the profitability of our properties and our access to the capital markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

during the ongoing pandemic us federal state and local governments have continued to mandate or recommend various actions to reduce or prevent the spread of covid19 which continues to directly impact many of our tenants and in particular those whose businesses may be considered nonessential grocery stores which anchor over 80 of our operating centers have generally been able to continue operating and serving their customers however nonessential businesses such as dinein restaurants fitness facilities and movie theaters in many states continue to experience significant declines in customer traffic when compared to previous years or have temporarily closed their locations in some cases multiple times in response to governmental orders or voluntary efforts to support social distancing 

due to the pandemic certain tenants have requested rent concessions or have sought to renegotiate future rents based on changes to the economic environment other tenants have chosen not to reopen or honor the terms of their existing lease agreements in addition moratoria and other temporary legal restrictions in certain states on our ability to bring legal action to enforce our leases have impacted our ability to collect rent and may continue to do so into 2021 

new leasing activity has declined and is expected to remain at lower levels than prepandemic into 2021 as businesses delay executing leases amidst the immediate and uncertain future economic impacts of the pandemic this coupled with tenant failures may result in decreased demand for retail space in our centers which could result in downward pressure on rents additionally due to delays in construction of tenant improvements due to the impacts of the pandemic it may take longer before new tenants are able to open and commence rent payments

the pandemic has adversely impacted our ability to start or complete tenant buildouts new ground up development and redevelopment of existing properties the pandemic has also impacted our ability to timely source materials for construction and caused labor shortages which have impacted our ability to complete construction projects on anticipated schedules new or extended government orders to combat the further spread of the virus could result in similar impacts to our development and redevelopment projects and supply chain which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operation

the full impacts of the pandemic on our future results of operations and overall financial performance remain uncertain while the vast majority of our lease income is derived from contractual rent payments the ability of certain of our tenants to meet their lease obligations have been negatively impacted by the disruptions and uncertainties of the pandemic our tenants’ ability to respond to these disruptions and uncertainties including adjusting to governmental orders and changes in their customers’ shopping habits and behaviors will impact their businesses’ ability to survive and ultimately their ability to comply with their lease obligations the risk of diminished sales and future closures exists so long as the virus remains active and continues to spread ultimately t he duration and severity of the health crisis in the united states and the speed at which the country states and localities are able to safely reopen and remain open will continue to materially impact the overall economy our retail tenants and therefore our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows until the virus is contained or eradicated or effective and reliable treatments andor vaccines are widely available and accepted by the public commerce and employment may not return to prepandemic levels and we may experience material reductions in our cash flows noi and financial performance compared to prepandemic periods

 

risk factors related to operating retailbased shopping centers 

economic and market conditions may adversely affect the retail industry and consequently reduce our revenues and cash flow and increase our operating expenses

our properties are leased primarily to retail tenants from whom we derive most of our revenue in the form of base rent expense recoveries and other income therefore our performance and operating results are directly linked to the economic and market conditions occurring in the retail industry we are subject to the risks that upon expiration leases for space in our properties are not renewed by existing tenants vacant space is not leased to new tenants andor tenants demand modified lease terms including costs for renovations or concessions moreover pandemics such as the pandemic may exacerbate the effects of these risks the economic and market conditions potentially affecting the retail industry and our properties specifically include the following



























to the extent that any or a combination of these conditions occur they are likely to impact the retail industry our retail tenants the demand and market rents for retail space the percent leased levels of our properties our ability to sell acquire or develop properties our operating results and our cash available for distributions to stock and unit holders

shifts in retail trends sales and delivery methods between brick and mortar stores ecommerce home delivery and curbside pickup may adversely impact our revenues and cash flows

retailers are increasingly impacted by ecommerce and changes in customer buying habits including the delivery or curbside pickup of items ordered online the pandemic has likely accelerated these trends and their potential impacts retailers are considering these ecommerce trends when making decisions regarding their bricks and mortar stores and how they will compete and innovate in a rapidly changing retail environment many retailers in our shopping centers provide services or sell goods which have historically been less likely to be purchased online however the continuing increase in ecommerce sales in all retail categories may cause retailers to adjust the size or number of their retail locations in the future or close stores our grocer tenants are incorporating ecommerce concepts through home delivery and curbside pickup which could reduce foot traffic at our centers in certain higherincome markets foot traffic at our centers may be impacted more meaningfully by these alternative delivery methods if consumers are willing to pay premiums for such services changes in shopping trends as a result of the growth in ecommerce may also impact the profitability of retailers that do not adapt to changes in market conditions including their financial condition and ability to pay rent this shift may adversely impact our percent leased and rental rates which would impact our results of operations and cash flows

 

changing economic and retail market conditions in geographic areas where our properties are concentrated may reduce our revenues and cash flow 

economic conditions in markets where our properties are concentrated can greatly influence our financial performance during the year ended december 31 2020 our properties in california florida texas new york and georgia accounted for 272 221 75 52 and 51 respectively of our noi from consolidated properties plus our prorata share from unconsolidated properties our revenues and cash flow may be adversely affected by this geographic concentration if market conditions such as supply of or demand for retail space deteriorate more significantly in these states compared to other geographic areas for example with respect to the pandemic california has imposed very stringent restrictions on reopening and has implemented stringent eviction moratoria making it more difficult in certain circumstances to collect rent and enforce our leases additionally there is a risk that many businesses and residents in major metropolitan cities may desire to relocate to different states or suburban markets as a result of the pandemic following the impact of state regulations on businesses and residents coupled with the shift to remote work 

our success depends on the continued presence and success of our “anchor” tenants

“anchor tenants” tenants occupying 10000 square feet or more operate large stores in our shopping centers pay a significant portion of the total rent at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by attracting shoppers to the property our net income and cash flow may be adversely affected by the loss of revenues and incurrence of additional costs in the event a significant anchor tenant













some anchors have the right to vacate their space and may prevent us from retenanting by continuing to comply and pay rent in accordance with their lease agreement vacated anchor space including space that may be owned by the anchor as discussed below can reduce rental revenues generated by the shopping center in other spaces because of the loss of the departed anchors customer drawing power in addition if a significant tenant vacates a property cotenancy clauses in select lease contracts may allow other tenants to modify or terminate their rent or lease obligations cotenancy clauses have several variants they may allow a tenant to postpone a store opening if certain other tenants fail to open their stores they may allow a tenant to close its store prior to lease expiration if another tenant closes its store prior to lease expiration or more commonly they may allow a tenant to pay reduced levels of rent until a certain number of tenants open their stores within the same shopping center

additionally some of our shopping centers are anchored by retailers who own their space whose location is within or immediately adjacent to our shopping center “shadow anchors” in those cases the shadow anchors appear to the consumer as a retail tenant of the shopping center and as a result attract additional consumer traffic to the center in the event that a shadow anchor were to close it could negatively impact our center as consumer traffic would likely be reduced 

a significant percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller “shop space” tenants and our net income may be adversely impacted if our smaller shop tenants are not successful

at december 31 2020 tenants occupying less than 10000 square feet “shop space tenants” represent approximately 356 of our gla with approximately 143 of those considered local tenants these tenants may be more vulnerable to negative economic conditions including the impacts from pandemics as they may have more limited resources and access to capital than anchor tenants shop space tenants may be facing reduced sales as a result of an increase in competition including from ecommerce retailers the types of shop space tenants vary from retail shops and restaurants to service providers if we are unable to attract the right type or mix of shop space tenants into our centers our revenues and cash flow may be adversely impacted

during times of economic downturns or uncertainties including during pandemics such as covid19 some tenants may suffer disproportionally greater impacts and be at greater risk of default on their lease obligations or request lease concessions from us if we are unable to attract the right type or mix of low or noncredit tenants into our centers our revenues and cash flow may be adversely impacted 

 

we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy 

although lease income is supported by longterm lease contracts tenants who file for bankruptcy have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant for unpaid rent may be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold moreover in the year ended december 31 2020 we saw meaningfully higher levels of tenant bankruptcies than in recent years as a result of the pandemic and we expect this trend to continue into at least the first half of 2021 additionally we may incur significant expense to recover our claim and to release the vacated space in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files for bankruptcy and rejects its leases we may experience a significant reduction in our revenues and may not be able to collect all prepetition amounts owed by the bankrupt tenant

many of our costs and expenses associated with operating our properties may remain constant or increase even if our lease income decreases 

certain costs and expenses associated with our operating our properties such as real estate taxes insurance utilities and common area expenses generally do not decrease in the event of reduced occupancy or rental rates nonpayment of rents by tenants general economic downturns pandemics or other similar circumstances in fact in some cases such as real estate taxes and insurance they may actually increase despite such events as such we may not be able to lower the operating expenses of our properties sufficiently to fully offset such circumstances and may not be able to fully recoup these costs from our tenants in such cases our cash flows operating results and financial performance may be adversely impacted

compliance with the americans with disabilities act and fire safety and other regulations may have a negative effect on us

all of our properties are required to comply with the americans with disabilities act “ada” which generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities compliance with ada requirements may require removal of access barriers and noncompliance may result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants or both while the tenants to whom we lease space in our properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions and typically under tenant leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these tenants to cover costs may be adversely affected in addition we are required to operate the properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations as they may be adopted by governmental entities and become applicable to the properties costs to be in compliance with the ada or any other building regulations could be material and have a negative impact on our results of operations 

risk factors related to real estate investments 

our real estate assets may decline in value and be subject to impairment losses which may reduce our net income

our real estate properties are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable we evaluate whether there are any indicators including property operating performance and general market conditions such that the value of the real estate properties including any related tangible or intangible assets or liabilities including goodwill may not be recoverable through the evaluation we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions including rental rates costs of tenant improvements leasing commissions anticipated holding periods and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition including the exit capitalization rate these key assumptions are subjective in nature and may differ materially from actual results changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the holding period of an asset or asset group which may result in an impairment loss and such loss may be material to the companys financial condition or operating performance to the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value 

the fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is determined through the use of comparable sales information and other market data if available or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the discounted cash flow approach such cash flow projections take into account expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other relevant criteria and therefore are subject to management judgment the impacts of the pandemic to future income trends and prospects is uncertain and continues to evolve therefore any assumptions impacting real estate values may be subject to change in the future which may impact the determination of fair value in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land we generally use market data and comparable sales information

these subjective assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment charge results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income which may be material there can be no assurance that we will not record impairment charges in the future related to our assets

 

we face risks associated with development redevelopment and expansion of properties 

we actively pursue opportunities for new retail development and existing property redevelopment or expansion development and redevelopment activities require various government and other approvals for entitlements and any delay in such approvals may significantly delay development and redevelopment projects we may not recover our investment in our projects for which approvals are not received and delays may adversely impact our expected returns additionally changes in political elections and policies may impact our ability to obtain favorable land use and zoning for inprocess and future developments and redevelopment projects we are subject to other risks associated with these activities including the following



















we face risks associated with the development of mixeduse commercial properties

we have expanded our investment focus to include a limited number of more complex acquisitions and mixeduse development and redevelopment projects in dense urban locations which pose unique risks to our return on investment mixeduse projects refer to real estate projects that in addition to retail space may also include space for residential office hotel or other commercial purposes we have less experience in developing and managing nonretail real estate than we do retail real estate as a result if a development or redevelopment project includes a nonretail use we may seek to develop that component ourselves sell the rights to that component to a thirdparty developer or partner with a developer 







in addition redevelopment of existing shopping centers into mixeduse projects generally includes tenant vacancies before and during the redevelopment which could result in volatility in noi 

 

we face risks associated with the acquisition of properties 

our investment strategy includes investing in highquality shopping centers that are leased to marketleading grocers categoryleading anchors specialty retailers or restaurants located in areas with high barriers to entry and above average household incomes and population densities the acquisition of properties andor real estate entities entails risks that include but are not limited to the following any of which may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows













we may be unable to sell properties when desired because of market conditions

our properties including their related tangible and intangible assets represent the majority of our total consolidated assets and they may not be readily convertible to cash moreover pandemics such as covid19 may impact our ability to sell properties on our preferred timing and at prices and returns we deem acceptable as a result our ability to sell one or more of our properties including properties held in joint ventures in response to changes in economic industry or other conditions may be limited the real estate market is affected by many factors such as general economic conditions availability and terms of financing interest rates and other factors including supply and demand for space that are beyond our control there may be less demand for lower quality properties that we have identified for ultimate disposition in markets with uncertain economic or retail environments and where buyers are more reliant on the availability of third party mortgage financing if we want to sell a property we can provide no assurance that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or at all or that the sales price of a property will be attractive at the relevant time or even exceed the carrying value of our investment 

changes in tax laws could impact our acquisition or disposition of real estate 

certain properties we own have a low tax basis which may result in a taxable gain on sale we intend to utilize internal revenue code section 1031 likekind exchanges to mitigate taxable income however there can be no assurance that we will identify properties that meet our investment objectives for acquisitions or that changes to the tax laws do not eliminate or significantly change 1031 exchanges in the event that we do not utilize 1031 exchanges we may be required to distribute the gain proceeds to shareholders or pay income tax which may reduce our cash flow available to fund our commitments

risk factors related to the environment affecting our properties 

climate change may adversely impact our properties directly and may lead to additional compliance obligations and costs as well as additional taxes and fees

we cannot reliably predict the extent rate or impact of climate change to the extent climate change causes adverse changes in weather patterns our properties in certain markets especially those nearer to the coasts may experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea‑levels further population migration may occur in response to these or other factors and negatively impact our centers climate and other environmental changes may result in volatile or decreased demand for retail space at certain of our properties or in extreme cases our inability to operate certain properties at all climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of insurance or making insurance unavailable moreover while the federal government has not yet enacted comprehensive legislation to address climate change certain states in which we own and operate shopping centers including california and new york have done so compliance with these and future new laws or regulations related to climate change may require us to make improvements to our existing properties resulting in increased capital expenditures or pay additional taxes and fees assessed on us or our properties although we strive to identify analyze and respond to the risk and opportunities that climate change presents at this time there can be no assurance that climate change will not have an adverse effect on the value of our properties and our financial performance 

 

geographic concentration of our properties makes our business more vulnerable to natural disasters severe weather conditions and climate change 

a significant number of our properties are located in areas that are susceptible to earthquakes tropical storms hurricanes tornadoes wildfires sealevel rise due to climate change and other natural disasters at december 31 2020 22 of the gla of our portfolio is located in the state of california including a number of properties in the san francisco bay and los angeles areas additionally 23 and 8 of the gla of our portfolio is located in the states of florida and texas respectively insurance costs for properties in these areas have increased and recent intense weather conditions may cause property insurance premiums to increase significantly in the future we recognize that the frequency and  or intensity of extreme weather events sealevel rise and other climatic changes may continue to increase and as a result our exposure to these events may increase these weather conditions may disrupt our business and the business of our tenants which may affect the ability of some tenants to pay rent and may reduce the willingness of tenants or residents to remain in or move to these affected areas therefore as a result of the geographic concentration of our properties we face risks including disruptions to our business and the businesses of our tenants and higher costs such as uninsured property losses higher insurance premiums and potential additional regulatory requirements by government agencies in response to perceived risks 

costs of environmental remediation may impact our financial performance and reduce our cash flow

under various federal state and local laws an owner or manager of real property may be liable for the costs to assess and remediate the presence of hazardous substances on the property which in our case generally arise from former dry cleaners gas stations asbestos usage and historic land use practices these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous substances the presence of or the failure to properly address the presence of hazardous substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral we can provide no assurance that we are aware of all potential environmental liabilities or their ultimate cost to address that our properties will not be affected by tenants or nearby properties or other unrelated third parties and that future uses or conditions or changes in environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional material environmental liabilities to us

risk factors related to corporate matters 

an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the insurance coverage on our properties may subject us to loss of capital and revenue on those properties

we carry comprehensive liability fire flood terrorism business interruption and environmental insurance for our properties with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties some types of losses such as losses from named windstorms earthquakes terrorism or wars may have more limited coverage or in some cases can be excluded from insurance coverage in addition it is possible that the availability of insurance coverage in certain areas may decrease in the future and the cost to procure such insurance may increase due to factors beyond our control we may reduce the insurance we procure as a result of the foregoing or other factors while we believe our coverage is appropriate and adequate to cover our insurable risks should a loss occur at any of our properties that is in excess of the property or casualty insurance limits of our policies we may lose part or all of our invested capital and revenues from such property which may have a material adverse impact on our operating results financial condition and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders

terrorist activities or violence occurring at our properties also may directly affect the value of our properties through damage destruction or loss insurance for such acts may be unavailable or cost more resulting in an increase to our operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations to the extent that our tenants are affected by such attacks and threats of attacks their businesses may be adversely affected including their ability to continue to meet obligations under their existing leases 

failure to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our business and operations

the success of our business depends in part on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees and our ability to attract retain and motivate talented employees may significantly impact our future performance competition for these individuals is intense and we cannot be assured that we will retain all of our executive management team and other key employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals for these positions in the future losing any one or more of these persons may have an adverse effect on us

 

the unauthorized access use theft or destruction of tenant or employee personal financial or other data or of regency’s proprietary or confidential information stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues 

many of our information technology systems including those we use for administration accounting and communications as well as the systems of our coinvestment partners and other thirdparty business partners and service providers whether cloudbased or hosted in proprietary servers contain personal financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our tenants and employees many of our information technology systems also contain our proprietary information and other confidential information related to our business we are frequently subject to attempts to compromise our information technology systems to the extent we or a third party were to experience a material breach of our or such third party’s information technology systems that result in the unauthorized access theft use destruction or other compromises of tenants’ or employees data or our confidential information stored in such systems including through cyberattacks or other external or internal methods such a breach may damage our reputation and cause us to lose tenants and revenues incur third party claims and cause disruption to our business and plans such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable us privacy and other laws and subject us to private consumer business partner or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability and we may not be able to recover these expenses from our service providers responsible parties or insurance carriers despite the ongoing significant investments in technology and training we make in cybersecurity we can provide no assurance that we will avoid or prevent such breaches or attacks

additionally federal state and local authorities continue to develop laws to address data privacy protection monitoring such changes and taking steps to comply involves significant costs and effort by management which may adversely affect our operating results and cash flows

despite the implementation of security measures for our disaster recovery and business continuity plans our systems are vulnerable to damages from multiple sources including computer viruses unauthorized access energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war and telecommunication failure any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business and cause us to incur additional costs to remedy such damages

risk factors related to our partnerships and joint ventures 

we do not have voting control over all of the properties owned in our coinvestment partnerships and joint ventures so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued

we have invested substantial capital as a partner in a number of partnerships and joint ventures to acquire own lease develop or redevelop properties these activities are subject to the same risks as our investments in our whollyowned properties these investments and other future similar investments may involve risks that would not be present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or other owners might become bankrupt suffer a deterioration in their creditworthiness or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions partners or other owners may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our own business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives

these investments and other future similar investments also have the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions such as a sale or financing because neither we nor our partner or other owner has full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or other owners might result in litigation or arbitration that may increase our expenses and prevent management from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or other owners might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we risk the possibility of being liable for the actions of our partners or other owners these factors may limit the return that we receive from such investments or cause our cash flows to be lower than our estimates

the termination of our partnerships may adversely affect our cash flow operating results and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders

if partnerships owning a significant number of properties were dissolved for any reason we could lose the asset property management leasing and construction management fees from these partnerships as well as the operating income of the properties which may adversely affect our operating results and our cash available for distribution to stock and unit holders certain of our partnership operating agreements provide either member the ability to elect buysell clauses the election of these dissolution provisions could require us to invest additional capital to acquire the partners’ interest or to sell our share of the property thereby losing the operating income and cash flow

 

risk factors related to funding strategies and capital structure 

our ability to sell properties and fund acquisitions and developments may be adversely impacted by higher market capitalization rates and lower noi at our properties which may dilute earnings

as part of our funding strategy we sell operating properties that no longer meet our investment standards or those with a limited future growth profile these sales proceeds are used to fund debt repayment acquisition of operating properties and the construction of new developments and redevelopments an increase in market capitalization rates or a decline in noi may cause a reduction in the value of centers identified for sale which would have an adverse impact on the amount of cash generated additionally the sale of properties resulting in significant tax gains may require higher distributions to our stockholders or payment of additional income taxes in order to maintain our reit status 

we depend on external sources of capital which may not be available in the future on favorable terms or at all

to qualify as a reit the parent company must among other things distribute to its stockholders each year at least 90 of its reit taxable income excluding any net capital gains because of these distribution requirements we may not be able to fund all future capital needs with income from operations in such instances we would rely on thirdparty sources of capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all our access to thirdparty sources of capital depends on a number of things including the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings our access to debt depends on our credit rating the willingness of creditors to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets in addition to finding creditors willing to lend to us we are dependent upon our joint venture partners to contribute their pro rata share of any amount needed to repay or refinance existing debt when lenders reduce the amount of debt our partnerships and joint ventures are eligible to refinance

in addition our existing debt arrangements also impose covenants that limit our flexibility in obtaining other financing additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders interests and additional debt financing may substantially increase our degree of leverage

without access to external sources of capital we would be required to pay outstanding debt with our operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales our operating cash flows may not be sufficient to pay our outstanding debt as it comes due and real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly at a return we believe is appropriate if we are required to deleverage our business with operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales we may be forced to reduce the amount of or eliminate altogether our distributions to stock and unit holders or refrain from making investments in our business

our debt financing may adversely affect our business and financial condition

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance which to a certain extent is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control in addition we do not expect to generate sufficient operating cash flow to make balloon principal payments on our debt when due if we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms we may be forced i to dispose of properties which might result in losses or ii to obtain financing at unfavorable terms either of which may reduce the cash flow available for distributions to stock and unit holders if we cannot make required mortgage payments the mortgagee may foreclose on the property securing the mortgage

covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition

our unsecured notes unsecured term loans and unsecured line of credit the “line” contain customary covenants including compliance with financial ratios such as ratio of indebtedness to total asset value and fixed charge coverage ratio these covenants may limit our operational flexibility and our investment activities moreover if we breach any of the covenants in our debt agreements and do not cure the breach within the applicable cure period our lenders may require us to repay the debt immediately even in the absence of a payment default many of our debt arrangements including our unsecured notes unsecured term loan and unsecured line of credit are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other material debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants may have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our stock

 

increases in interest rates would cause our borrowing costs to rise and negatively impact our results of operations 

although a significant amount of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates we do borrow funds at variable interest rates under our credit facility term loan and certain secured borrowings as of december 31 2020 less than 10 of our outstanding debt was variable rate debt not hedged to fixed rate debt increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense on any variable rate debt to the extent we have not hedged our exposure to changes in interest rates in addition increases in interest rates will affect the terms under which we refinance our existing debt as it matures to the extent we have not hedged our exposure to changes in interest rates this would reduce our future earnings and cash flows which may adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also may reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our stock and unit holders

hedging activity may expose us to risks including the risks that a counterparty will not perform and that the hedge will not yield the economic benefits we anticipate which may adversely affect us 

we manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements these arrangements involve risk such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements and that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes there can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will qualify for hedge accounting or that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations should we desire to terminate a hedging arrangement there may be significant costs and cash requirements involved to fulfill our obligations under the hedging arrangement in addition failure to effectively hedge against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations

the interest rates on our unsecured credit facilities as well as on our variable rate mortgages and interest rate swaps might change based on changes to the method in which libor or its replacement rate is determined 

in july 2017 the financial conduct authority “fca” that regulates the london interbank offered rate “libor” announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 as a result the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york organized the alternative reference rates committee “arrc” which identified the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as its preferred alternative to usdlibor in derivatives and other financial contracts we are not able to predict when libor will cease to be available or when there will be sufficient liquidity in the sofr markets any changes adopted by fca or other governing bodies in the method used for determining libor may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported libor if that were to occur our interest payments could change in addition uncertainty about the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates andor payments that are higher or lower than if libor were to remain available in its current form

we have contracts that are indexed to libor including our 125 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and fifteen mortgages within our consolidated and unconsolidated portfolios totaling 2255 million on a prorata basis as well as interest rate swaps to fix these variable cash flows with notional amounts totaling 1770 million on a prorata basis these libor based instruments mature between 2020 and 2028 we are monitoring and evaluating the related risks which include interest on loans or amounts received and paid on derivative instruments these risks arise in connection with transitioning contracts to a new alternative rate including any resulting value transfer that may occur the value of loans securities or derivative instruments tied to libor could also be impacted if libor is limited or discontinued for some instruments the method of transitioning to an alternative rate may be challenging as they may require negotiation with the respective counterparty

if a contract is not transitioned to an alternative rate and libor is discontinued the impact is likely to vary by contract if libor is discontinued or if the methods of calculating libor change from their current form interest rates on our current or future indebtedness and related interest rate swaps may be adversely affected

while we expect libor to be available in substantially its current form through june 2023 it is possible that libor will become nonrepresentative prior to that point this could result for example if sufficient banks decline to make submissions to the libor administrator in that case the risks associated with the transition to an alternative reference rate will be accelerated and magnified

 

risk factors related to t he market price for our securities 

changes in economic and market conditions may adversely affect the market price of our securities

the market price of our debt and equity securities may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors many of which are out of our control including



































these factors may cause the market price of our securities to decline regardless of our financial condition results of operations business or prospects it is impossible to ensure that the market price of our securities including our common stock will not fall in the future a decrease in the market price of our common stock may reduce our ability to raise additional equity in the public markets selling common stock at a decreased market price would have a dilutive impact on existing stockholders

there is no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates

our ability to continue to pay dividends at historical rates or to increase our dividend rate will depend on a number of factors including among others the following







if we do not maintain or periodically increase the dividend on our common stock it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and other securities

 

risk factors relating to the company’s qualification as a reit 

if the parent company fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes it would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates

we believe that the parent company qualifies for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes and we plan to operate so that we can continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit if the parent company continues to qualify as a reit it generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders many reit requirements however are highly technical and complex the determination that the parent company is a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances some of which may not be totally within our control and some of which involve questions of interpretation for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income must come from specific passive sources like rent that are itemized in the reit tax laws there can be no assurance that the internal revenue service “irs” or a court would agree with the positions we have taken in interpreting the reit requirements we are also required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains we will be subject to us federal income tax on our undistributed taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years the fact that we hold many of our assets through coinvestment partnerships and their subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements furthermore congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult for the parent company to remain qualified as a reit

also unless the irs granted relief under certain statutory provisions the parent company would remain disqualified as a reit for four years following the year it first failed to qualify if the parent company failed to qualify as a reit currently andor with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired we would have to pay significant income taxes reducing cash available to pay dividends which would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to pay any dividends to stockholders in order to maintain our reit status although we believe that the parent company qualifies as a reit we cannot be assured that the parent company will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes

even if the parent company qualifies as a reit for federal income tax purposes we are required to pay certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from “prohibited transactions” that income will be subject to a 100 tax in general prohibited transactions include sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business the determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale while we have undertaken a significant number of asset sales in recent years we do not believe that those sales should be considered prohibited transactions but there can be no assurance that the irs would not contend otherwise

new legislation as well as new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may be introduced enacted or promulgated from time to time that may change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification in a manner that is adverse to our stockholders

dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates

subject to limited exceptions dividends paid by reits other than distributions designated as capital gain dividends qualified dividends or returns of capital are not eligible for reduced rates for qualified dividends paid by “c” corporations and are taxable at ordinary income tax rates the more favorable tax rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends may cause investors who are individuals trusts and estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which may adversely affect the value of the shares of reits including the shares of our capital stock

certain foreign stockholders may be subject to us federal income tax on gain recognized on a disposition of our common stock if we do not qualify as a “domestically controlled” reit

a foreign person disposing of a us real property interest including shares of a us corporation whose assets consist principally of us real property interests is generally subject to us federal income tax on any gain recognized on the disposition this tax does not apply however to the disposition of stock in a reit if the reit is “domestically controlled” in general we will be a domestically controlled reit if at all times during the fiveyear period ending on the applicable stockholder’s disposition of our stock less than 50 in value of our stock was held directly or indirectly by nonus persons if we were to fail to qualify as a domestically controlled reit gain recognized by a foreign stockholder on a disposition of our common stock would be subject to us federal income tax unless our common stock was traded on an established securities market and the foreign stockholder did not at any time during a specified testing period directly or indirectly own more than 10 of our outstanding common stock

 

legislative or other actions affecting reits may have a negative effect on us 

the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us department of the treasury changes to the tax laws with or without retroactive application may adversely affect regency or our investors we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect regency or our investors new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us there is also a risk that reit status may be adversely impacted by a change in tax or other laws also the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities or an investment in other entities may change making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit

complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities

the reit provisions of the code limit our ability to hedge our liabilities generally income from a hedging transaction that constitutes “qualifying income” for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests applicable to reits does not constitute “gross income” for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests provided that we properly identify the hedging transaction pursuant to the applicable sections of the code and treasury regulations to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions or fail to make the proper tax identifications the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests as a result of these rules we may need to limit our use of otherwise advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a taxable reit subsidiary “trs”

risks related to the company’s common stock 

restrictions on the ownership of the parent company’s capital stock to preserve its reit status may delay or prevent a change in control

ownership of more than 7 by value of our outstanding capital stock is prohibited with certain exceptions by the parent companys articles of incorporation for the purpose of maintaining its qualification as a reit this 7 limitation may discourage a change in control and may also i deter tender offers for our capital stock which offers may be attractive to our stockholders or ii limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their capital stock that might otherwise exist if an investor attempted to assemble a block in excess of 7 of our outstanding capital stock or to affect a change in control

the issuance of the parent companys capital stock may delay or prevent a change in control

the parent companys articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to 30000000 shares of preferred stock and 10000000 shares of special common stock and to establish the preferences and rights of any shares issued the issuance of preferred stock or special common stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control the provisions of the florida business corporation act regarding affiliated transactions may also deter potential acquisitions by preventing the acquiring party from consummating a merger or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of our disinterested stockholders

ownership in the parent company may be diluted in the future

in the future a stockholder’s percentage ownership in the company may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions capital market transactions or other corporate purposes including equity awards we will grant to our directors officers and employees in the past we have issued equity in the secondary market and may do so again in the future depending on the price of our stock and other factors

in addition our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue without the approval of our stockholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation powers preferences and relative participating optional and other special rights including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions as our board of directors generally may determine the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock for example we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock

our leases for tenant space under 10000 square feet generally have initial terms ranging from three to seven years leases greater than 10000 square feet “anchor leases” generally have initial lease terms in excess of five years and are mostly comprised of anchor tenants many of the leases contain provisions allowing the tenant the option of extending the term of the lease at expiration our leases typically provide for the payment of fixed base rent the tenant’s prorata share of real estate taxes insurance and common area maintenance “cam” expenses and reimbursement for utility costs if not directly metered

 

the following table summarizes prorata lease expirations for the next ten years and thereafter for our consolidated and unconsolidated properties assuming no tenants renew their leases gla and dollars in thousands 

 





during 2021 we have a total of 1086 leases expiring representing 29 million square feet of gla these expiring leases have an average base rent of 2524 psf the average base rent of new leases signed during 2020 was 2622 psf during periods of economic weakness or when percent leased is low tenants have more bargaining power which may result in rental rate declines on new or renewal leases in periods of recovery andor when percent leased levels are high landlords have more bargaining power which generally results in rental rate growth on new and renewal leases as a result of the pandemic new leasing activity has declined as many businesses delay executing leases amidst its immediate and uncertain future economic impacts this trend coupled with additional potential retail failures resulting from the pandemic may result in decreased demand for retail space in our centers which could result in downward pressure on rents

executing on our strategy  

during the year ended december 31 2020 we had net income attributable to common stockholders of 449 million which includes the impacts of a 1321 million goodwill impairment charge and 1170 million of uncollectible lease income as compared to net income attributable to common stockholders of 2394 million during the year ended december 31 2019

during the year ended december 31 2020



 







we continued our development and redevelopment of high quality shopping centers in a targeted manner amidst the pandemic although many in process projects have stopped or slowed while we evaluate current market conditions and assess the feasibility of these projects as of december 31 2020 we have a total of 14 properties in process of development or redevelopment with total estimated prorata project costs of 3193 million as compared to 22 properties and 3508 million at december 31 2019 

we maintained a conservative balance sheet providing liquidity and financial flexibility to respond to these uncertain economic times and to cost effectively fund investment commitments opportunities and debt maturities















 

leasing activity and significant tenants 

we believe our highquality grocery anchored shopping centers located in densely populated desirable infill trade areas create attractive spaces for retail and service providers to operate their businesses 

prorata percent leased

the following table summarizes prorata percent leased of our combined consolidated and unconsolidated shopping center portfolio

 



our percent leased in both the anchor and shop space categories declined during 2020 due to tenant closures and bankruptcies primarily as a result from the impacts of the pandemic additionally a number of tenants at our properties were either required or elected to temporarily close due to the pandemic some of these tenants may be unable to sustain their business models in this current pandemic environment and may fail while the pandemic continues we may be unable to find suitable replacement tenants for an extended period of time and the terms of the leases with replacement tenants may be less favorable to us as such our percent leased could decline further in future periods resulting in reduced lease income from both lower base rent and recoveries from tenants for cam real estate taxes and insurance costs at our centers

prorata leasing activity

the following table summarizes leasing activity including our prorata share of activity within the portfolio of our coinvestment partnerships

 



 



new leasing activity has declined as many businesses delay executing leases amidst the immediate and uncertain future economic impacts from the pandemic however renewal leasing activity has remained consistent with 2019 levels new and renewal rent spreads as compared to prior rents on these same spaces leased remained positive at 22 for the twelve months ended december 31 2020 although the spreads tightened throughout the year as compared to 57 for the twelve months ended december 31 2019 with 

 

the average annual base rent of all shop space leases due to expire during the next 12 months of 3337 psf there is a possibility of negative rent spreads occurring as we execute new or renewal lease deals considering the t otal weighted average base rent on signed shop space leases during 2020 was lower at 3287 psf    

significant tenants and concentrations of risk

we seek to reduce our operating and leasing risks through geographic diversification and by avoiding dependence on any single property market or tenant based on percentage of annualized base rent the following table summarizes our most significant tenants of which the top four are grocers

 





bankruptcies and credit concerns

the impact of bankruptcies may increase significantly if tenants occupying our centers are unable to withstand and recover from the disruptions caused by the pandemic which could materially adversely impact our lease income since the pandemic began we have seen an increase in the number of tenants filing for bankruptcy due to the pandemic there has been and continues to be a greater focus on whether tenants’ businesses are considered essential or nonessential which may directly impact the tenants’ ability to operate and generate sufficient cash flows to meet their operating expenses including lease payments continued higher unemployment levels could also negatively impact consumer spending and along with largescale business failures have an adverse effect on our results from operations we seek to mitigate these potential impacts through tenant diversification replacing weaker tenants with stronger operators anchoring our centers with market leading grocery stores that drive customer traffic and maintaining a presence in affluent suburbs and dense infill trade areas as of december 31 2020 approximately 63 of prorata average base rent in our portfolio is derived from tenants’ businesses classified as essential

since the pandemic began the company has been closely monitoring its cash collections which significantly declined from historic levels in the initial months of the pandemic most notably from tenants whose businesses are classified as nonessential the pandemic has continued to result in certain tenants requesting concessions from rent obligations including deferrals abatements and requests to negotiate future rents while some tenants have been unable to reopen or have not honored the terms of their existing lease agreements the company has entered into approximately 1600 agreements representing 408 million of prorata base rent or 46 of our total annual base rent with tenants within our consolidated real estate portfolio and our unconsolidated real estate investment partnerships enabling them to defer a portion of their rental payments and repay them over future periods the company expects to continue to work with other tenants which may result in further rent concessions or legal actions as determined to be necessary and appropriate due to the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic there can be no assurances that all such deferred rent will ultimately be collected or collected within the timeframes agreed upon 

we closely monitor the operating performance of tenants in our shopping centers as well as those experiencing significant changes to their business models as can be seen through reduced customer traffic in their stores operators  tenants who are unable to withstand these and other business pressures such as significant cash flow declines or debt maturities may file for bankruptcy as a result of our research and findings we may reduce new leasing suspend leasing or curtail allowances for construction of leasehold improvements within certain retail categories or to a specific tenant in order to reduce our risk of loss from bankruptcies and store closings 

although base rent is supported by longterm lease contracts tenants who file bankruptcy generally have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant for unpaid rent might be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold additionally we may incur significant expense to adjudicate our claim and to release the vacated space in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues as of december 31 2020 tenants who are currently in bankruptcy and continue to occupy space in our shopping centers represent an aggregate of 04 of our annual base rent on a prorata basis we anticipate fewer tenant bankruptcies in 2021 but it is possible they could increase depending on the length and severity of the pandemic 

 

results from operations 

comparison of the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 

our revenues changed as summarized in the following table

 



lease income decreased 1141 million driven by the following contractually billable components of rent to the tenants per the lease agreements

1051 million decrease from recognizing additional uncollectible lease income consisting of 281 million increase in uncollectible straightline rent receivables and 770 million increase in uncollectible billable tenant receivables the pandemic has been most impactful to those tenants considered nonessential by governmental authorities the current economic environment has resulted in changes in our expectations of collecting certain tenant receivables and their related future contracted rent increases previously recognized through straightline rent approximately 92 of prorata base rent billed for the three months ended december 31 2020 has been collected as of february 8 2021 

57 million decrease from billable base rent as follows









32 million decrease in above and below market rent primarily from the sale of operating properties

16 million increase in other lease income from higher lease termination fees

14 million decrease in percentage rent due to lower sales in this pandemic environment by certain tenants

361000 remaining net decrease driven primarily by a reduction in straightline rent

management transaction and other fees decreased 31 million primarily from decreases in development construction management and property management fees from projects within our unconsolidated partnerships two development projects within our unconsolidated partnerships completed during 2019 resulting in reduced development fees in 2020 additionally decreases in property rent collections during this pandemic have negatively impacted our property management income earned from our unconsolidated partnerships

changes in our operating expenses are summarized in the following table

 



depreciation and amortization costs changed as follows



 







operating and maintenance costs remained steady even with increases in property insurance premiums as those increases were offset by decreases in common area maintenance costs during the pandemic and a decrease in lease termination expense 

general and administrative expenses remained constant although there was a 102 million increase from less development overhead capitalized as many development and redevelopment projects were delayed due to the pandemic offset by 82 million decrease in incentive compensation costs and 23 million decrease in other expenses related to lower travel and conference costs amidst the pandemic 

real estate taxes changed as follows









other operating expenses increased 48 million primarily attributable to a 79 million increase in development pursuit costs charged to expense for abandoned projects offset by a 29 million decrease in state and franchise taxes

the following table presents the components of other expense income

 



the 54 million net increase in total interest expense is primarily due to







 

during the year ended december 31 2020  we recognized 1321 million of goodwill impairment due to the significant market and economic impacts of the pandemic  the market disruptions triggered evaluation of reporting unit fair values for goodwill impairment of our 269 reporting units with goodwill 87 reporting units were determined to have fair values lower than carrying value as such goodwill impairment losses were recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill exceeded its fair value limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

the 356 million decrease in provision for impairment of real estate is due to





during 2020 we recognized gains of 675 million from the sale of ten land parcels five operating properties receipt of property insurance proceeds and the remeasurement gain from the acquisition of controlling interest in a previously held equity investment during 2019 we sold five operating properties and six land parcels for gains totaling 242 million

during 2020 we incurred 218 million of debt extinguishment costs of which 194 million related to the early redemption of our unsecured notes due to mature in 2022 and a 24 million charge for termination of an interest rate swap on our term loan that was repaid in january 2021 during 2019 we redeemed unsecured notes and repaid one mortgage all prior to original maturity resulting in 12 million of debt extinguishment costs

supplemental earnings information 

we use certain nongaap performance measures in addition to certain performance metrics determined under gaap as we believe these measures improve the understanding of our operating results we believe these nongaap measures provide useful information to our board of directors management and investors regarding certain trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations our management uses these nongaap measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses purposes of determining management incentive compensation and budgeting forecasting and planning purposes we provide prorata financial information because we believe it assists investors and analysts in estimating our economic interest in our consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships when read in conjunction with our reported results under gaap we believe presenting our prorata share of operating results along with other nongaap measures may assist in comparing our operating results to other reits we continually evaluate the usefulness relevance limitations and calculation of our reported nongaap performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public and thus such reported measures could change see “defined terms” in part i item 1

we do not consider nongaap measures an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with gaap rather they supplement gaap measures by providing additional information we believe to be useful to our shareholders the principal limitation of these nongaap financial measures is they may exclude significant expense and income items that are required by gaap to be recognized in our consolidated financial statements in addition they reflect the exercise of management’s judgment about which expense and income items are excluded or included in determining these nongaap financial measures in order to compensate for these limitations reconciliations of the nongaap financial measures we use to their most directly comparable gaap measures are provided nongaap financial measures should not be relied upon in evaluating our financial condition results of operations or future prospects

 

prorata same property noi 

our prorata same property noi changed as follows

 





billable base rent decreased 32 million due to loss of rents from bankruptcies and other tenant moveouts which were partially offset by contractual rent increases 

recoveries from tenants decreased 12 million largely due to declines in percent leased stemming from bankruptcies and other tenant moveouts

percentage rent decreased 15 million principally due to lower tenant sales which were impacted by lockdowns during the pandemic which affected customer traffic and tenant sales

termination fees increased 43 million primarily due to strategic changes in merchandising mix and negotiated terminations for tenant failures related to covid19 

uncollectible lease income increased 790 million due to changes in collection expectations of our lease income caused by the impact of the pandemic on our tenants

other property income decreased 11 million primarily due to reduced demand for paid parking during the pandemic

real estate taxes increased 58 million due to changes in assessed values at properties across our portfolio

liquidity and capital resources 

general 

we use cash flows generated from operating investing and financing activities to strengthen our balance sheet finance our development and redevelopment projects fund our investment activities and maintain financial flexibility we continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt or equity to repay maturing debt or fund our capital commitments

except for 200 million of private placement debt our parent company has no capital commitments other than its guarantees of the commitments of our operating partnership all remaining debt is held by our operating partnership or by our coinvestment partnerships the operating partnership is a coissuer and a guarantor of the 200 million of outstanding debt of our parent company the parent company will from time to time access the capital markets for the purpose of issuing new equity and will simultaneously contribute all of the offering proceeds to the operating partnership in exchange for additional partnership units

as the pandemic and its related impacts continue to evolve we have taken the following steps to ensure sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility 

 











we also continue to closely monitor and assess the capital requirements of all in process and planned developments redevelopments and capital expenditures which has resulted in our delaying phasing or curtailing certain inprocess and planned development redevelopment and capital expenditure projects we have no unsecured debt maturities until 2024 and a manageable level of secured mortgage maturities during 2021 including those mortgages within our joint ventures 

we continually evaluate alternative financing options and we believe we can obtain financing on reasonable terms however there can be no assurance that additional financing or capital will be available or that the terms will be acceptable or advantageous to us based upon our available cash balance sources of capital our current credit ratings the number of high quality unencumbered properties we own and our decisions to delay phase or curtail projects we believe our available capital resources are sufficient to meet our expected capital needs for at least the next 12 months 

in addition to our unrestricted cash at december 31 2020 we have the following additional sources of capital available

 







the declaration of dividends is determined quarterly by our board of directors on february 10 2021 our board of directors declared a common stock dividend of 0595 per share payable on april 6 2021 to shareholders of record as of march 15 2021 while future dividends will be determined at the discretion of our board of directors we plan to continue paying an aggregate amount of distributions to our stock and unit holders that at a minimum meet the requirements to continue qualifying as a reit for federal income tax purposes

we have historically generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our dividend distributions during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 we generated cash flow from operations of 4991 million and 6213 million respectively and paid 4033 million and 3916 million in dividends to our common stock and unit holders respectively including the payment of the dividend we declared on december 15 2020 and paid on january 5 2021 of 1014 million we are closely monitoring our cash collections from our tenants which significantly declined from historic levels at the start of the pandemic and resulting restrictions as of february 8 2021 we experienced sequential improvement in our collection rates of prorata base rent billed by quarter in 2020 as follows

 



based upon our collection experience since the pandemic began we expect our collection rates will continue to trend lower than historical prepandemic averages for the foreseeable future until the vaccines are fully deployed restrictions are lifted and the percent 

 

leased in our shopping centers increases  if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our current dividend level a reduction in our cash dividend may be necessary or dividends could be paid in regency stock in order to remain in compliance with minimum reit distributions 

we currently have 14 development and redevelopment projects in various stages of construction along with a pipeline of potential projects for future development or redevelopment as the effects of the pandemic remain uncertain we continue to evaluate the pandemic’s impacts on the feasibility of our pipeline projects and nonessential capital expenditures including project scope investment tenant use timing and return on investment

after repaying our 265 million term loan and funding our dividend payment in january 2021 with cash on hand we estimate that we will require capital during the next twelve months of approximately 3536 million to repay maturing debt to fund construction and related costs for committed tenant improvements and inprocess development and redevelopment and to make capital contributions to our coinvestment partnerships if we start new developments or redevelopments commit to new acquisitions prepay debt prior to maturity or repurchase shares of our common stock our cash requirements will increase the combination of our 12 billion capacity available on our line and no unsecured debt maturities until 2024 strengthens our financial position enabling us to fund our expected nearterm operating and capital expenditures amid the uncertainty of operating cash flows during this pandemic and recovery period we expect to generate the necessary cash to fund our longterm capital needs from cash flow from operations borrowings from our line proceeds from the sale of real estate mortgage loan and unsecured bank financing and when the capital markets are favorable proceeds from the sale of equity or the issuance of new unsecured debt 

we endeavor to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets as measured by 896 of our whollyowned real estate assets being unencumbered at december 31 2020 such assets allow us to access the secured and unsecured debt markets and to maintain availability on the line our trailing twelve month fixed charge coverage ratio including our prorata share of our partnerships was 36x and 43x for the periods ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively and our prorata net debttooperating ebitda re ratio on a trailing twelve month basis was 60x and 54x respectively for the same periods we expect that these ratios could worsen during 2021 as a result of potential further impacts from the ongoing pandemic

our line term loan and unsecured debt require that we remain in compliance with various covenants which are described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements we are in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2020 and expect to remain in compliance

critical accounting estimates 

knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial statements the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities as of a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period these accounting estimates are based upon but not limited to our judgments about historical and expected future results current market conditions and interpretation of industry accounting standards they are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness however the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates

 

collectibility of lease income

lease income which includes base rent percentage rent and recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs insurance and real estate taxes are the companys principal source of revenue as a result of generating this revenue we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants 

lease income for operating leases with fixed payment terms is recognized on a straightline basis over the expected term of the lease for all leases for which collectibility is considered probable at the commencement date at lease commencement the company generally expects that collectibility is probable due to the company’s credit assessment of tenants and other creditworthiness analysis undertaken before entering into a new lease therefore income from most operating leases is initially recognized on a straightline basis for operating leases in which collectibility of lease income is not considered probable lease income is recognized on a cash basis and all previously recognized and uncollected lease income is reversed in the period in which the lease income is determined not to be probable of collection in addition to the leasespecific collectibility assessment the company may recognize a general reserve as a reduction to lease income for its portfolio of operating lease receivables which are not expected to be fully collectible based on the company’s historical collection experience although we estimate uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income actual experience may differ from those estimates

real estate investments

acquisition of real estate investments

upon acquisition of real estate operating properties the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land building building improvements and tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and belowmarket leases and inplace leases assumed debt and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date based on these estimates the company allocates the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities transaction costs associated with asset acquisitions are capitalized while such costs are expensed for business combinations in the period incurred beginning in july 2017 the company adopted accounting standard update 201701 business combinations topic 805 clarifying the definition of a business  under which the acquisition of operating properties are generally considered asset acquisitions if however the acquisition is determined to be a business combination any excess consideration above the fair value allocated to the applicable assets and liabilities results in goodwill fair value is determined based on an exit price approach which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 

the companys methodology for determining fair value of the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities includes estimating an “asif vacant” fair value of the physical property which includes land building and improvements in addition the company determines the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets and liabilities considering the following categories i value of inplace leases and ii above and belowmarket value of inplace leases

the value of inplace leases is estimated based on the value associated with the costs avoided in originating leases compared to the acquired inplace leases as well as the value associated with lost rental and recovery revenue during the assumed leaseup period the value of inplace leases is recorded to depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the remaining expected term of the respective leases 

abovemarket and belowmarket inplace lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the inplace leases and ii managements estimate of fair market lease rates for comparable inplace leases measured over a period equal to the remaining noncancelable term of the lease including belowmarket renewal options if applicable the value of abovemarket leases is amortized as a reduction of lease income over the remaining terms of the respective leases and the value of belowmarket leases is accreted to lease income over the remaining terms of the respective leases including belowmarket renewal options if applicable

changes to these assumptions could result in a different pattern of recognition if tenants do not remain in their lease through the expected term or exercise an assumed renewal option there could be a material impact to earnings 

valuation of real estate investments

in accordance with gaap we evaluate our real estate for impairment whenever there are indicators including property operating performance and general market conditions that the carrying value of our real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may not be recoverable if such indicators occur we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions including rental rates expected leasing activity costs of tenant improvements leasing commissions anticipated hold period comparable sales information and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition including the exit capitalization rate these key assumptions are subjective in nature and the resulting impairment if any could differ from the actual gain or loss recognized upon ultimate sale in an arms length transaction if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value 

the fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available as well as the use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the discounted cash flow approach such 

 

cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other factors and therefore is subject to management judgment and changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land we generally use market data and comparable sales information   changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the companys financial condition or operating performance 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 to consolidated financial statements

environmental matters 

we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining primarily to specific chemicals historically used by certain current and former dry cleaning tenants the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers and the presence of underground petroleum storage tanks we believe that the few tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations generally we endeavor to require tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to more environmentally friendly systems in accordance with the terms of our leases we also have a blanket environmental insurance policy for thirdparty liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination we have also secured environmental insurance policies where appropriate on a relatively small number of specific properties with known contamination in order to mitigate our environmental risk we monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites we also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so

as of december 31 2020 we had accrued liabilities of 83 million for our prorata share of environmental remediation including our investments in real estate partnerships we believe that the ultimate remediation of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental contamination that our estimate of liabilities will not change as more information becomes available that any previous owner occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants by the condition of nearby properties or by unrelated third parties or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have offbalance sheet arrangements financings or other relationships with other unconsolidated entities other than our unconsolidated investment partnerships or other persons also known as variable interest entities not previously discussed many of our unconsolidated investment partnerships’ operating properties have been financed with nonrecourse loans to which we have no repayment guarantees 

inflationdeflation 

inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers however inflation may become a greater concern in the future substantially all of our longterm leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation which require tenants to pay their prorata share of operating expenses including commonarea maintenance real estate taxes insurance and utilities thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation in addition many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years which permits us to seek increased rents upon rerental at market rates however during deflationary periods or periods of economic weakness minimum rents and percentage rents may decline as the supply of available retail space exceeds demand and consumer spending declines percent leased declines may also result in lower recovery rates of our operating expenses

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

we are exposed to two significant components of interest rate risk





we continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt to repay maturing debt or fund our commitments although the capital markets have experienced volatility related to the pandemic we continue to believe that we will be able to successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund maturing debt obligations given our credit ratings our capacity under our unsecured credit facilities and the number of high quality unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings however the degree to which such capital market volatility will adversely impact the interest rates on any new debt that we may issue is uncertain

our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the table below presents the principal cash flows weighted average interest rates of remaining debt and the fair value of total debt as of december 31 2020 for variable rate mortgages and unsecured credit facilities for which we have interest rate swaps in place to fix the interest rate they are included in the fixed rate debt section below at their allin fixed rate the table is presented by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes although the average interest rate for variable rate debt is included in the table those rates represent rates that existed as of december 31 2020 and are subject to change on a monthly basis in addition the company continually assesses the market risk for its floating rate debt and believes that a 1 increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 350000 per year based on 341 million of floating rate mortgage debt outstanding at december 31 2020 if the company increases its line of credit balance in the future additional decreases to future earnings and cash flows could occur

further the table below incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2020 and does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date or obligations repaid before maturity since firm commitments are not presented the table has limited predictive value as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at that time and actual interest rates

the table below presents the principal cash flow payments associated with our outstanding debt by year weighted average interest rates on debt outstanding at each yearend and fair value of total debt as of december 31 2020

we are among the largest owners of shopping centers in the nation based on revenues number of properties gla and market capitalization there are numerous companies and individuals engaged in the ownership development acquisition and operation of shopping centers that compete with us in our targeted markets including grocery store chains that also anchor some of our shopping centers this results in competition for attracting tenants as well as the acquisition of existing shopping centers and new development sites we believe that our competitive advantages are driven by

defined terms 

in addition to the required generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” presentations we use certain nongaap performance measures as we believe these measures improve the understanding of our operational results we continually evaluate the usefulness relevance limitations and calculation of our reported nongaap performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public and thus such reported measures could change

the following terms as defined are commonly used by management and the investing public to understand and evaluate our operational results









companies use different depreciable lives and methods and real estate values historically fluctuate with market conditions since nareit ffo excludes depreciation and amortization and gains on sales and impairments of real estate it provides a performance measure that when compared year over year reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates rental rates operating costs acquisition and development activities and financing costs this provides a perspective of our financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with gaap thus nareit ffo is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of our operating performance which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered a substitute measure of cash flows from operations we provide a reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders to nareit ffo



 









we provide prorata financial information because we believe it assists investors and analysts in estimating our economic interest in our consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships when read in conjunction with the company’s reported results under gaap we believe presenting our prorata share of assets liabilities operating results and certain operating metrics along with other nongaap measures makes comparisons of other reits operating results to ours more meaningful the prorata information provided is not nor is it intended to be presented in accordance with gaap the prorata supplemental details of assets and liabilities and supplemental details of operations reflect our proportionate economic ownership of the assets liabilities and operating results of the properties in our portfolio

the prorata information is prepared on a basis consistent with the comparable consolidated amounts and is intended to more accurately reflect our proportionate economic interest in the assets liabilities and operating results of properties in our portfolio we do not control the unconsolidated investment partnerships and the prorata presentations of the assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses do not represent our legal claim to such items the partners are entitled to profit or loss allocations and distributions of cash flows according to the operating agreements which generally provide for such allocations according to their invested capital our share of invested capital establishes the ownership interests we use to prepare our prorata share

the presentation of prorata information has limitations which include but are not limited to the following





because of these limitations the prorata financial information should not be considered independently or as a substitute for our financial statements as reported under gaap we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap financial statements using the prorata information as a supplement









 

 




 item 1a risk factors

risk factors related to the retail industry 

economic and market conditions may adversely affect the retail industry and consequently reduce our revenues and cash flow and increase our operating expenses

our properties are leased primarily to retail tenants from whom we derive most of our revenue in the form of base rent expense recoveries and other income therefore our performance and operating results are directly linked to the economic and market conditions occurring in the retail industry we are subject to the risks that upon expiration leases for space in our properties are not renewed by existing tenants vacant space is not leased to new tenants or tenants demand new lease terms including costs for renovations or concessions the market for leasing retail space in our properties may be adversely affected by any of the following



























to the extent that any of these conditions occur they are likely to impact the retail industry our retail tenants the demand and market rents for retail space the occupancy levels of our properties our ability to sell acquire or develop properties our operating results and our cash available for distributions to stock and unit holders

shifts in retail sales and delivery methods between brick and mortar stores ecommerce home delivery and curbside pickup may adversely impact our revenues and cash flows

retailers are increasingly impacted by ecommerce and changes in customer buying habits including the delivery or curbside pickup of items ordered online retailers are considering these ecommerce trends when making decisions regarding their bricks and mortar stores and how they will compete and innovate in a rapidly changing retail environment many retailers in our shopping centers provide services or sell goods which have historically been less likely to be purchased online however the continuing increase in ecommerce sales in all retail categories may cause retailers to adjust the size or number of retail locations in the future or close stores our grocer tenants are incorporating ecommerce concepts through home delivery and curbside pickup which could reduce foot traffic at our centers in certain higherincome markets foot traffic at our centers may be impacted more by these alternative delivery methods if consumers are willing to pay premiums for such services this shift may adversely impact our occupancy and rental rates which would impact our revenues and cash flows changes in shopping trends as a result of the growth in ecommerce may also impact the profitability of retailers that do not adapt to changes in market conditions these conditions may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows if we are unable to meet the needs of our tenants or if our tenants encounter financial difficulties as a result of changing market conditions

 

changing economic and retail market conditions in geographic areas where our properties are concentrated may reduce our revenues and cash flow 

economic conditions in markets where our properties are concentrated can greatly influence our financial performance during the year ended december 31 2019 our properties in california florida texas new york and virginia accounted for 290 210 69 57 and 50 respectively of our noi from consolidated properties plus our prorata share from unconsolidated properties “prorata basis” our revenues and cash flow may be adversely affected by this geographic concentration if market conditions such as supply of or demand for retail space deteriorate more significantly in these states compared to other geographic areas

our success depends on the success and continued presence of our “anchor” tenants

“anchor tenants” tenants occupying 10000 square feet or more occupy large stores in our shopping centers pay a significant portion of the total rent at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by attracting shoppers to the property we derive significant revenues from anchor tenants such as publix kroger co albertsons companies inc tjx companies inc and whole foods who accounted for 32 30 28 24 and 24 respectively of our total annualized base rent on a prorata basis for the year ended december 31 2019 additionally other tenants with significant lease obligations at a singular location could also have a material impact on our earnings if they are unable to fulfill their lease obligations or fail to renew their leases our net income and cash flow may be adversely affected by the loss of revenues and additional costs in the event a significant anchor tenant













some anchors have the right to vacate their space and may prevent us from retenanting by continuing to comply and pay rent in accordance with their lease agreement vacated anchor space including space owned by the anchor can reduce rental revenues generated by the shopping center in other spaces because of the loss of the departed anchors customer drawing power if a significant tenant vacates a property cotenancy clauses in select lease contracts may allow other tenants to modify or terminate their rent or lease obligations cotenancy clauses have several variants they may allow a tenant to postpone a store opening if certain other tenants fail to open their stores they may allow a tenant to close its store prior to lease expiration if another tenant closes its store prior to lease expiration or more commonly they may allow a tenant to pay reduced levels of rent until a certain number of tenants open their stores within the same shopping center

additionally many of our shopping centers are anchored by retailers who own their space whose location is within or immediately adjacent to our shopping center “shadow anchors” in those cases the shadow anchors appear to the consumer as a retail tenant of the shopping center and as a result attract additional consumer traffic to the center in the event that a shadow anchor were to close it could negatively impact our center as consumer traffic would likely be reduced 

a significant percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller “shop space” tenants and our net income may be adversely impacted if our smaller shop tenants are not successful

“shop space tenants” tenants occupying less than 10000 square feet may be more vulnerable to negative economic conditions as they have more limited resources than anchor tenants shop space tenants may be facing reduced sales as a result of an increase in competition including from ecommerce retailers the types of shop space tenants vary from retail shops and restaurants to service providers if we are unable to attract the right type or mix of shop space tenants into our centers our revenues and cash flow may be adversely impacted

at december 31 2019 shop space tenants represent approximately 360 of our gla leased at average base rents of 3486 per square foot “psf” a onepercent decline in our shop space occupancy may result in a reduction to base rent of approximately 50 million

we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy

although lease income including base rent and recoveries from tenants are supported by longterm lease contracts tenants who file for bankruptcy have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores any unsecured claim we hold against a 

 

bankrupt tenant for unpaid rent might be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold additionally we may incur significant expense to recover our claim and to release the vacated space in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files for bankruptcy and rejects its leases we may experience a significant reduction in our revenues and may not be able to collect all prepetition amounts owed by the bankrupt tenant 

risk factors related to real estate investments and operations 

we are subject to numerous laws and regulations that may adversely affect our operations or expose us to liability

our properties are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations some of which may conflict with one another or be subject to varying judicial or regulatory interpretations these laws and regulations may include zoning laws building codes competition laws rules and agreements landlordtenant laws property tax regulations or changes in real estate assessments including changes in laws related thereto and other laws and regulations generally applicable to business operations noncompliance with such laws and regulations and any associated litigation may expose us to liability

our real estate assets may decline in value and be subject to impairment losses which may reduce our net income

our real estate properties are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable we evaluate whether there are any indicators including property operating performance and general market conditions such that the value of the real estate properties including any related tangible or intangible assets or liabilities including goodwill may not be recoverable through the evaluation we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions including rental rates costs of tenant improvements leasing commissions anticipated holding periods and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition including the exit capitalization rate these key assumptions are subjective in nature and may differ materially from actual results changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the holding period of an asset or asset group which may result in an impairment loss and such loss may be material to the companys financial condition or operating performance to the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value 

the fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is determined through the use of comparable sales information and other market data if available or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the discounted cash flow approach such cash flow projections take into account expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other relevant criteria and therefore are subject to management judgment changes in these factors may impact the determination of fair value in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land we generally use market data and comparable sales information

these subjective assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment charge results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income which may be material there can be no assurance that we will not record impairment charges in the future related to our assets

we face risks associated with development redevelopment and expansion of properties

we actively pursue opportunities for new retail development or existing property redevelopment or expansion development and redevelopment activities require various government and other approvals for entitlements and any delay in such approvals may significantly delay this process we may not recover our investment in development or redevelopment projects for which approvals are not received we are subject to other risks associated with these activities including the following risks













 







we face risks associated with the development of mixeduse commercial properties

we are expanding our investment focus to include more complex acquisitions and mixeduse development and redevelopment projects in very dense urban locations which pose unique risks to our return on investment mixeduse projects refer to real estate projects that in addition to retail space may also include space for residential office hotel or other commercial purposes we have less experience in developing and managing nonretail real estate than we do retail real estate as a result if a development or redevelopment project includes a nonretail use we may seek to develop that component ourselves sell the rights to that component to a thirdparty developer or partner with a developer 







in addition redevelopment of existing shopping centers into mixeduse projects generally includes tenant vacancies before and during the redevelopment which could result in volatility in noi 

we face risks associated with the acquisition of properties

our investment strategy includes investing in highquality shopping centers that are leased to marketdominant grocers categoryleading anchors specialty retailers or restaurants located in areas with high barriers to entry and above average household incomes and population densities the acquisition of properties andor real estate entities entails risks that include but are not limited to the following any of which may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows













we face risks if we expand into new markets

if opportunities arise we may acquire or develop properties in markets where we currently have no presence each of the risks applicable to acquiring or developing properties in our current markets are applicable to acquiring developing and integrating properties in new markets in addition we may not possess the same level of familiarity with the dynamics and conditions of the new markets we may enter which may adversely affect our operating results and investment returns in those markets

 

we may be unable to sell properties when desired because of market conditions 

our properties including their related tangible and intangible assets represent the majority of our total consolidated assets and they may not be readily convertible to cash as a result our ability to sell one or more of our properties including properties held in joint ventures in response to changes in economic industry or other conditions may be limited the real estate market is affected by many factors such as general economic conditions availability and terms of financing interest rates and other factors including supply and demand for space that are beyond our control there may be less demand for lower quality properties that we have identified for ultimate disposition in markets with uncertain economic or retail environments and where buyers are more reliant on the availability of third party mortgage financing if we want to sell a property we can provide no assurance that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or at all or that the sales price of a property will be attractive at the relevant time or even exceed the carrying value of our investment moreover if a property is mortgaged we may not be able to obtain a release of the lien on that property without the payment of a substantial prepayment penalty which may restrict our ability to dispose of the property even though the sale might otherwise be desirable

certain properties we own have a low tax basis which may result in a taxable gain on sale we intend to utilize 1031 exchanges to mitigate taxable income however there can be no assurance that we will identify properties that meet our investment objectives for acquisitions in the event that we do not utilize 1031 exchanges we may be required to distribute the gain proceeds to shareholders or pay income tax which may reduce our cash flow available to fund our commitments

certain of the properties in our portfolio are subject to ground leases if we are unable to renew a ground lease purchase the fee simple interest or are found to be in breach of a ground lease we may be adversely affected

we have 28 properties in our portfolio that are either partially or completely on land subject to ground leases with third parties accordingly we only own a longterm leasehold or similar interest in those properties if we are unable to purchase a fee interest in the underlying land or extend the terms of these leases before or upon their expiration as to which no assurance can be given we will lose our interest in the improvements and the right to operate such properties in addition if we are found to be in breach of a ground lease we may lose our interest in the improvements and the right to operate the property that is subject to the ground lease the existing lease terms including renewal options were taken into consideration when making our investment decisions the purchase price and subsequent improvements are being depreciated over the shorter of the remaining life of the ground leases or the useful life of the underlying assets if we were to lose the right to operate a property due to not exercising renewal options of the ground lease or a breach we would be unable to derive income from such property which would impair the value of our investments and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

climate change may adversely impact our properties directly and may lead to additional compliance obligations and costs as well as additional taxes and fees

to the extent climate change causes adverse changes in weather patterns our properties in certain markets may experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea‑levels climate change may result in volatile or decreased demand for retail space at certain of our properties or in extreme cases our inability to operate certain properties at all climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of insurance or making insurance unavailable moreover compliance with new laws or regulations related to climate change including compliance with “green” building codes may require us to make improvements to our existing properties or pay additional taxes and fees assessed on us or our properties although we strive to identify analyze and respond to the risk and opportunities that climate change presents at this time there can be no assurance that climate change will not have an adverse effect on us 

geographic concentration of our properties makes our business more vulnerable to natural disasters severe weather conditions and climate change

a significant number of our properties are located in areas that are susceptible to earthquakes tropical storms hurricanes tornadoes wildfires sealevel rise and other natural disasters at december 31 2019 28 of the total insured value of our portfolio is located in the state of california including a number of properties in the san francisco bay and los angeles areas additionally 18 and 7 of the total insured value of our portfolio is located in the states of florida and texas respectively recent intense weather conditions may cause property insurance premiums to increase significantly in the future we recognize that the frequency and  or intensity of extreme weather events sealevel rise and other climatic changes may continue to increase and as a result our exposure to these events may increase these weather conditions may disrupt our business and the business of our tenants which may affect the ability of some tenants to pay rent and may reduce the willingness of tenants or residents to remain in or move to these affected areas therefore as a result of the geographic concentration of our properties we face risks including disruptions to our business and the businesses of our tenants and higher costs such as uninsured property losses higher insurance premiums and potential additional regulatory requirements by government agencies in response to perceived risks 

an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the insurance coverage on our properties may subject us to loss of capital and revenue on those properties

we carry comprehensive liability fire flood terrorism business interruption and environmental insurance for our properties with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties some types of losses such as losses from named windstorms earthquakes terrorism or wars may have limited coverage or be excluded from insurance coverage although we carry 

 

specific insurance coverage for named windstorm and earthquake losses the policies are subject to deductibles up to 2 to 5 of the total insured value of each property up to a 10 million maximum deductible per occurrence for each of these perils with limits of 300 million per occurrence for all perils except earthquake which has a total annual aggregate limit of 300 million terrorism coverage is limited to 200 million per occurrence related to property damage liability claims are limited to 151 million per occurrence should a loss occur at any of our properties that is subject to a substantial deductible or is in excess of the property or casualty insurance limits of our policies we may lose part or all of our invested capital and revenues from such property which may have a material adverse impact on our operating results financial condition and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders 

terrorist activities or violence occurring at our properties also may directly affect the value of our properties through damage destruction or loss insurance for such acts may be unavailable or cost more resulting in an increase to our operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations to the extent that our tenants are affected by such attacks and threats of attacks their businesses may be adversely affected including their ability to continue to meet obligations under their existing leases 

loss of our key personnel may adversely affect our business and operations

the success of our business depends in part on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees and our ability to attract retain and motivate talented employees may significantly impact our future performance competition for these individuals is intense and we cannot be assured that we will retain all of our executive management team and other key employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals for these positions in the future losing any one or more of these persons may have an adverse effect on us

we face competition from numerous sources including other reits and other real estate owners

the ownership of shopping centers is highly fragmented we face competition from other public reits large private investors institutional investors and from numerous small owners in the acquisition ownership and leasing of shopping centers we also compete to develop shopping centers with other reits engaged in development activities as well as with local regional and national real estate developers this competition may







if we cannot successfully compete in our targeted markets our cash flow and therefore distributions to stock and unit holders may be adversely affected

costs of environmental remediation may reduce our cash flow available for distribution to stock and unit holders

under various federal state and local laws an owner or manager of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or addressing the presence of hazardous substances on the property generally arising from dry cleaners gas stations and historic land use practices these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous substances the presence of or the failure to properly address the presence of hazardous substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral we can provide no assurance that we are aware of all potential environmental liabilities that any previous owner occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us that our properties will not be affected by tenants or nearby properties or other unrelated third parties and that future uses or conditions or changes in environmental laws and regulations will not result in additional material environmental liabilities to us

compliance with the americans with disabilities act and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make unexpected expenditures

all of our properties are required to comply with the americans with disabilities act “ada” which generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities compliance with ada requirements may require removal of access barriers and noncompliance may result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants or both while the tenants to whom we lease space in our properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions and typically under tenant leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these tenants to cover costs may be adversely affected in addition we are required to operate the properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations as they may be adopted by governmental entities and become applicable to the properties we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with these requirements and these expenditures may have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our financial obligations and make distributions to our stock and unit holders

 

the unauthorized access use theft or destruction of tenant or employee personal financial or other data or of regency’s proprietary or confidential information stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues 

many of our information technology systems including those we use for administration accounting and communications as well as the systems of our coinvestment partners and other thirdparty business partners and service providers whether cloudbased or hosted in proprietary servers contain personal financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our tenants and employees many of our information technology systems also contain our proprietary information and other confidential information related to our business we are frequently subject to attempts to compromise our information technology systems to the extent we or a third party were to experience a material breach of our or such third party’s information technology systems that result in the unauthorized access theft use destruction or other compromises of tenants’ or employees data or our confidential information stored in such systems including through cyberattacks or other external or internal methods such a breach may damage our reputation and cause us to lose tenants and revenues incur third party claims and cause disruption to our business and plans such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable us privacy and other laws and subject us to private consumer business partner or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability and we may not be able to recover these expenses from our service providers responsible parties or insurance carriers

additionally federal state and local authorities continue to develop laws to address data privacy protection monitoring such changes and taking steps to comply involves significant costs and effort by management which may adversely affect our operating results and cash flows

the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyberattacks and breaches of information technology systems as well as the sources and targets of these attacks change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time we manage cyber risk by evaluating the impact of a potential cyber breach on our business and determining the level of investment in the prevention detection and response to a breach we continue to make significant investments in technology thirdparty services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyberattacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss

despite the implementation of security measures for our disaster recovery and business continuity plans our systems are vulnerable to damages from multiple sources including computer viruses unauthorized access energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war and telecommunication failure any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business and cause us to incur additional costs to remedy such damages

risk factors related to our partnerships and joint ventures 

we do not have voting control over all of the properties owned in our coinvestment partnerships and joint ventures so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued

we have invested substantial capital as a partner in a number of partnerships and joint ventures to acquire own lease develop or redevelop properties these activities are subject to the same risks as our investments in our whollyowned properties these investments and other future similar investments may involve risks that would not be present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or other owners might become bankrupt suffer a deterioration in their creditworthiness or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions partners or other owners may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our own business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives

these investments and other future similar investments also have the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions such as a sale or financing because neither we nor our partner or other owner has full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or other owners might result in litigation or arbitration that may increase our expenses and prevent management from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or other owners might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we risk the possibility of being liable for the actions of our partners or other owners these factors may limit the return that we receive from such investments or cause our cash flows to be lower than our estimates

the termination of our partnerships may adversely affect our cash flow operating results and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders

if partnerships owning a significant number of properties were dissolved for any reason we could lose the asset property management leasing and construction management fees from these partnerships as well as the operating income of the properties which may adversely affect our operating results and our cash available for distribution to stock and unit holders certain of our partnership operating agreements provide either member the ability to elect buysell clauses the election of these dissolution provisions could require us to invest additional capital to acquire the partners’ interest or to sell our share of the property thereby losing the operating income and cash flow

 

risk factors related to funding strategies and capital structure 

our ability to sell properties and fund acquisitions and developments may be adversely impacted by higher market capitalization rates and lower noi at our properties which may dilute earnings

as part of our funding strategy we sell operating properties that no longer meet our investment standards or those with a limited future growth profile these sales proceeds are used to fund debt repayment acquisition of operating properties and the construction of new developments and redevelopments an increase in market capitalization rates or a decline in noi may cause a reduction in the value of centers identified for sale which would have an adverse impact on the amount of cash generated additionally the sale of properties resulting in significant tax gains may require higher distributions to our stockholders or payment of additional income taxes in order to maintain our reit status 

we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through taxdeferred contribution transactions which may result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell such assets

we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in our operating partnership which may result in stockholder dilution this acquisition structure may have the effect of among other things reducing the amount of tax depreciation we may deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties and may require that we agree to protect the contributors’ ability to defer recognition of taxable gain through restrictions on our ability to dispose of the acquired properties andor the allocation of partnership debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases these restrictions may limit our ability to sell an asset at a time or on terms that would be favorable absent such restrictions

we depend on external sources of capital which may not be available in the future on favorable terms or at all

to qualify as a reit the parent company must among other things distribute to its stockholders each year at least 90 of its reit taxable income excluding any net capital gains because of these distribution requirements we may not be able to fund all future capital needs with income from operations in such instances we would rely on thirdparty sources of capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all our access to thirdparty sources of capital depends on a number of things including the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings our access to debt depends on our credit rating the willingness of creditors to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets in addition to finding creditors willing to lend to us we are dependent upon our joint venture partners to contribute their pro rata share of any amount needed to repay or refinance existing debt when lenders reduce the amount of debt our partnerships and joint ventures are eligible to refinance

in addition our existing debt arrangements also impose covenants that limit our flexibility in obtaining other financing additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders interests and additional debt financing may substantially increase our degree of leverage

without access to external sources of capital we would be required to pay outstanding debt with our operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales our operating cash flows may not be sufficient to pay our outstanding debt as it comes due and real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly at a return we believe is appropriate if we are required to deleverage our business with operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales we may be forced to reduce the amount of or eliminate altogether our distributions to stock and unit holders or refrain from making investments in our business

our debt financing may adversely affect our business and financial condition

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance which to a certain extent is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control in addition we do not expect to generate sufficient operating cash flow to make balloon principal payments on our debt when due if we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms we may be forced i to dispose of properties which might result in losses or ii to obtain financing at unfavorable terms either of which may reduce the cash flow available for distributions to stock and unit holders if we cannot make required mortgage payments the mortgagee may foreclose on the property securing the mortgage

covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition

our unsecured notes unsecured term loans and unsecured line of credit contain customary covenants including compliance with financial ratios such as ratio of indebtedness to total asset value and fixed charge coverage ratio these covenants may limit our operational flexibility and our investment activities moreover if we breach any of the covenants in our debt agreements and do not cure the breach within the applicable cure period our lenders may require us to repay the debt immediately even in the absence of a payment default many of our debt arrangements including our unsecured notes unsecured term loan and unsecured line of credit are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other material debt obligations as a result any default under our debt 

 

covenants may have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our stock 

increases in interest rates would cause our borrowing costs to rise and negatively impact our results of operations

although a significant amount of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates we do borrow funds at variable interest rates under our credit facility and term loan as of december 31 2019 65 of our outstanding debt was variable rate debt not hedged to fixed increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense on any variable rate debt to the extent we have not hedged our exposure to changes in interest rates in addition increases in interest rates will affect the terms under which we refinance our existing debt as it matures to the extent we have not hedged our exposure to changes in interest rates this would reduce our future earnings and cash flows which may adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also may reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our stock and unit holders

hedging activity may expose us to risks including the risks that a counterparty will not perform and that the hedge will not yield the economic benefits we anticipate which may adversely affect us

we manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements these arrangements involve risk such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements and that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes there can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will qualify for hedge accounting or that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations should we desire to terminate a hedging arrangement there may be significant costs and cash requirements involved to fulfill our obligations under the hedging arrangement in addition failure to effectively hedge against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations

the interest rates on our unsecured credit facilities as well as on our variable rate mortgages and interest rate swaps might change based on changes to the method in which libor or its replacement rate is determined

in july 2017 the financial conduct authority “fca” that regulates libor announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 as a result the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york organized the alternative reference rates committee “arrc” which identified the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as its preferred alternative to usdlibor in derivatives and other financial contracts we are not able to predict when libor will cease to be available or when there will be sufficient liquidity in the sofr markets any changes adopted by fca or other governing bodies in the method used for determining libor may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported libor if that were to occur our interest payments could change in addition uncertainty about the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates andor payments that are higher or lower than if libor were to remain available in its current form

we have contracts that are indexed to libor including our 125 billion unsecured revolving credit facility 265 million term loan and fifteen mortgages within our consolidated and unconsolidated portfolio totaling 2255 million on a prorata basis as well as interest rate swaps to fix these variable cash flows with notional amounts totaling 4420 million on a prorata basis these libor based instruments mature between 2020 and 2028 we are monitoring and evaluating the related risks which include interest on loans or amounts received and paid on derivative instruments these risks arise in connection with transitioning contracts to a new alternative rate including any resulting value transfer that may occur the value of loans securities or derivative instruments tied to libor could also be impacted if libor is limited or discontinued for some instruments the method of transitioning to an alternative rate may be challenging as they may require negotiation with the respective counterparty

if a contract is not transitioned to an alternative rate and libor is discontinued the impact is likely to vary by contract if libor is discontinued or if the methods of calculating libor change from their current form interest rates on our current or future indebtedness and related interest rate swaps may be adversely affected

while we expect libor to be available in substantially its current form until the end of 2021 it is possible that libor will become unavailable prior to that point this could result for example if sufficient banks decline to make submissions to the libor administrator in that case the risks associated with the transition to an alternative reference rate will be accelerated and magnified

 

risk factors related to our company and the market price for our securities 

changes in economic and market conditions may adversely affect the market price of our securities

the market price of our debt and equity securities may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors many of which are out of our control including



































these factors may cause the market price of our securities to decline regardless of our financial condition results of operations business or prospects it is impossible to ensure that the market price of our securities including our common stock will not fall in the future a decrease in the market price of our common stock may reduce our ability to raise additional equity in the public markets selling common stock at a decreased market price would have a dilutive impact on existing stockholders

there is no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates

our ability to continue to pay dividends at historical rates or to increase our dividend rate will depend on a number of factors including among others the following







if we do not maintain or periodically increase the dividend on our common stock it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and other securities

 

enhanced focus on corporate responsibility and sustainability  specifically related to environmenta l social and governance matters  may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks 

we as well as increasing numbers of investors are focused on corporate responsibility and sustainability specifically related to environmental social and governance matters “esg” some investors may use these matters to guide their investment strategies thirdparty providers of corporate responsibility ratings and reports on companies have increased to meet growing investor demand for measurement of corporate responsibility performance although we have generally scored highly in these metrics to date there can be no assurance that we will continue to score highly in the future in addition the criteria by which companies are rated may change which could cause us to receive lower scores than in the past we may face reputational damage in the event our corporate responsibility and sustainability procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by various constituencies furthermore should our competitors outperform us in such metrics potential or current investors may elect to invest with our competition instead the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on the price of our shares and our business financial condition and results of operations including increased capital expenditures andor increased operating expenses

risk factors related to laws and regulations 

if the parent company fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes it would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates

we believe that the parent company qualifies for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes and we plan to operate so that we can continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit if the parent company continues to qualify as a reit it generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders many reit requirements however are highly technical and complex the determination that the parent company is a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances some of which may not be totally within our control and some of which involve questions of interpretation for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income must come from specific passive sources like rent that are itemized in the reit tax laws there can be no assurance that the internal revenue service “irs” or a court would agree with the positions we have taken in interpreting the reit requirements we are also required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains we will be subject to us federal income tax on our undistributed taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years the fact that we hold many of our assets through coinvestment partnerships and their subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements furthermore congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult for the parent company to remain qualified as a reit

also unless the irs granted relief under certain statutory provisions the parent company would remain disqualified as a reit for four years following the year it first failed to qualify if the parent company failed to qualify as a reit currently andor with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired we would have to pay significant income taxes reducing cash available to pay dividends which would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to pay any dividends to stockholders in order to maintain our reit status although we believe that the parent company qualifies as a reit we cannot be assured that the parent company will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes

even if the parent company qualifies as a reit for federal income tax purposes we are required to pay certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from “prohibited transactions” that income will be subject to a 100 tax in general prohibited transactions include sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business the determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale while we have undertaken a significant number of asset sales in recent years we do not believe that those sales should be considered prohibited transactions but there can be no assurance that the irs would not contend otherwise

new legislation as well as new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may be introduced enacted or promulgated from time to time that may change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification in a manner that is adverse to our stockholders

recent changes to the us tax laws may have a significant negative impact on the overall economy our tenants our investors and our business

the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 made significant changes to the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” while the changes in the tax cuts and jobs act generally appear to be favorable with respect to reits the extensive changes to nonreit provisions in the code may have unanticipated effects on us or our stockholders including our taxable income the amount of distributions to our stockholders required in order to maintain our reit status and our relative tax advantage as a reit the longterm impact of the tax cuts and jobs act on the overall economy government revenues our tenants us and the real estate industry cannot be reliably predicted at this stage of the new law’s implementation furthermore the tax cuts and jobs act may negatively impact certain of our tenants’ operating results financial condition and future business plans the tax cuts and jobs act may also 

 

result in reduced government revenues and therefore reduced government spending which may negatively impact some of our tenants that rely on government funding there can be no assurance that the tax cuts and jobs act will not adversely impact our operating results financial condition and future business operations 

dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates

subject to limited exceptions dividends paid by reits other than distributions designated as capital gain dividends qualified dividends or returns of capital are not eligible for reduced rates for qualified dividends paid by “c” corporations and are taxable at ordinary income tax rates the more favorable tax rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends may cause investors who are individuals trusts and estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which may adversely affect the value of the shares of reits including the shares of our capital stock

under the recently passed tax cuts and jobs act the rate brackets for noncorporate taxpayer’s ordinary income are adjusted the top tax rate is reduced from 396 to 37 excluding the 38 medicare tax on net investment income and ordinary reit dividends are taxed at even lower effective rates under the tax cuts and jobs act for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2026 distributions from reits that are treated as dividends but are not designated as qualified dividends or capital gain dividends are generally taxed as ordinary income after deducting 20 of the amount of the dividend in the case of noncorporate stockholders at the maximum ordinary income tax rate of 37 applicable for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2026 the maximum tax rate on ordinary reit dividends for noncorporate stockholders is generally 296 plus the 38 medicare tax on net investment income

certain foreign stockholders may be subject to us federal income tax on gain recognized on a disposition of our common stock if we do not qualify as a “domestically controlled” reit

a foreign person disposing of a us real property interest including shares of a us corporation whose assets consist principally of us real property interests is generally subject to us federal income tax on any gain recognized on the disposition this tax does not apply however to the disposition of stock in a reit if the reit is “domestically controlled” in general we will be a domestically controlled reit if at all times during the fiveyear period ending on the applicable stockholder’s disposition of our stock less than 50 in value of our stock was held directly or indirectly by nonus persons if we were to fail to qualify as a domestically controlled reit gain recognized by a foreign stockholder on a disposition of our common stock would be subject to us federal income tax unless our common stock was traded on an established securities market and the foreign stockholder did not at any time during a specified testing period directly or indirectly own more than 10 of our outstanding common stock

legislative or other actions affecting reits may have a negative effect on us

the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us department of the treasury changes to the tax laws with or without retroactive application may adversely affect regency or our investors we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect regency or our investors new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us also the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities or an investment in other entities may change making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit

complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities

the reit provisions of the code limit our ability to hedge our liabilities generally income from a hedging transaction that constitutes “qualifying income” for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests applicable to reits does not constitute “gross income” for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests provided that we properly identify the hedging transaction pursuant to the applicable sections of the code and treasury regulations to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions or fail to make the proper tax identifications the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests as a result of these rules we may need to limit our use of otherwise advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a taxable reit subsidiary “trs”

restrictions on the ownership of the parent companys capital stock to preserve its reit status may delay or prevent a change in control

ownership of more than 7 by value of our outstanding capital stock is prohibited with certain exceptions by the parent companys articles of incorporation for the purpose of maintaining its qualification as a reit this 7 limitation may discourage a change in control and may also i deter tender offers for our capital stock which offers may be attractive to our stockholders or ii limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their capital stock that might otherwise exist if an investor attempted to assemble a block in excess of 7 of our outstanding capital stock or to affect a change in control

 

the issuance of the parent companys capital stock may delay or prevent a change in control 

the parent companys articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to 30000000 shares of preferred stock and 10000000 shares of special common stock and to establish the preferences and rights of any shares issued the issuance of preferred stock or special common stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control the provisions of the florida business corporation act regarding affiliated transactions may also deter potential acquisitions by preventing the acquiring party from consummating a merger or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of our disinterested stockholders

executing on our strategy 

we had net income attributable to the company of 2394 million during the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to 2491 million during the year ended december 31 2018

we sustained same property noi growth







we continued our development and redevelopment of high quality shopping centers at attractive returns on investment











we maintained a conservative balance sheet providing financial flexibility to cost effectively fund investment opportunities and debt maturities









 

leasing activity and significant tenants 

we believe our highquality grocery anchored shopping centers located in densely populated desirable infill trade areas create attractive spaces for retail tenants 

prorata occupancy

the following table summarizes prorata occupancy rates of our combined consolidated and unconsolidated shopping center portfolio

 



the decline in both anchor and shop space percent leased is primarily attributable to bankruptcy filings

prorata leasing activity

the following table summarizes leasing activity including our prorata share of activity within the portfolio of our coinvestment partnerships

 





 



 

 

total weighted average base rent on signed shop space leases during 2019 was 3359 psf and exceeds the average annual base rent of all shop space leases due to expire during the next 12 months of 3256 psf the increase in tenant allowance and landlord work committed on new anchor leases signed in 2019 is attributable to anchor deals that include costs to either convert units to a specialized use deliver new gla  or demise units to accommodate smaller tenant formats    

significant tenants and concentrations of risk

we seek to reduce our operating and leasing risks through geographic diversification and by avoiding dependence on any single property market or tenant the following table summarizes our most significant tenants based on their percentage of annualized base rent

 





bankruptcies and credit concerns

our management team devotes significant time to researching and monitoring retail trends consumer preferences customer shopping behaviors changes in retail delivery methods and changing demographics in order to anticipate the challenges and opportunities impacting the retail industry a greater shift to ecommerce could negatively impact our tenants’ sales potentially resulting in large scale business failures which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations we seek to mitigate these potential impacts through tenant diversification replacing weaker tenants with stronger operators anchoring our centers with market leading grocery stores that drive foot traffic and maintaining a presence in affluent suburbs and dense infill trade areas as a result of our research and findings we may reduce new leasing suspend leasing or curtail allowances for construction of leasehold improvements within a certain retail category or to a specific retailer in order to reduce our risk from bankruptcies and store closings

we closely monitor the operating performance and rent collections of tenants in our shopping centers as well as those retailers experiencing significant changes to their business models as a result of reduced customer traffic in their stores and increased competition from ecommerce sales retailers that are unable to withstand these and other business pressures such as significant debt maturities may file for bankruptcy although base rent is supported by longterm lease contracts tenants filing for bankruptcy protection generally have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant for unpaid rent might be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold for operating leases in which collectability of lease income is not probable lease income is recognized on a cash basis and all previously recognized lease income is reversed in the period in which the lease income is determined not to be probable of collection additionally we may incur significant expense to adjudicate our claim and to release the vacated space in the event that a tenant with a significant amount of annualized base rent files bankruptcy and cancels its leases we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues tenants who are currently in bankruptcy and continue to occupy space in our shopping centers at december 31 2019 represent an aggregate of 06 of our annual base rent on a prorata basis which includes 05 for the 57000 square foot barneys’ space in new york the barneys’ lease is expected to terminate in february 2020

supplemental earnings information 

we use certain nongaap performance measures in addition to certain performance metrics determined under gaap as we believe these measures improve the understanding of our operating results we provide prorata financial information because we believe it assists investors and analysts in estimating our economic interest in our consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships when read in conjunction with the company’s reported results under gaap we believe presenting our prorata share of operating results along with other nongaap measures may assist in comparing the companys operating results to other reits we continually evaluate the usefulness relevance limitations and calculation of our reported nongaap performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public and thus such reported measures could change see “defined terms” in part i item 1

prorata same property noi 

our prorata same property noi changed as follows

 







billable base rent increased 152 million driven by increases in rental rate growth on new and renewal leases and contractual rent steps in existing leases partially offset by a decline in rent paying occupancy

operating and maintenance costs increased 36 million due to increases in recoverable costs including insurance security and property maintenance offset by decreases in snow removal costs 

termination expense decreased 12 million due to more significant costs in 2018 to terminate specific tenant leases 

real estate taxes decreased 35 million due to successful supplemental tax appeal receipts at certain properties in 2019 in addition 2018 included higher real estate tax expense related to supplemental tax bills received from the 2017 merger with equity one

liquidity and capital resources 

general 

we use cash flows generated from operating investing and financing activities to strengthen our balance sheet finance our development and redevelopment projects fund our investment activities and maintain financial flexibility we continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt or equity to repay maturing debt or fund our capital commitments

except for 500 million of unsecured public and private placement debt our parent company has no capital commitments other than its guarantees of the commitments of our operating partnership all remaining debt is held by our operating partnership or by our coinvestment partnerships the operating partnership is a coissuer and a guarantor of the 500 million of outstanding debt of our parent company the parent company will from time to time access the capital markets for the purpose of issuing new equity and will simultaneously contribute all of the offering proceeds to the operating partnership in exchange for additional partnership units based upon our available sources of capital our current credit ratings and the number of high quality unencumbered properties we own we believe our available capital resources are sufficient to meet our expected capital needs 

in addition to our 1130 million of unrestricted cash at december 31 2019 we have the following additional sources of capital available

 









 

our dividend distribution policy is set by our board of directors who monitors our financial position our board of directors recently declared a common stock dividend of 059 5 per share payable on march 5  2020  to shareholders of record as of february 2 4  2020  future dividends will be declared at the discretion of our board of directors and will be subject to capital requirements and availability we plan to continue paying an aggregate amount of distributions to our stock and unit holders that at a minimum meet the requirements to continue qualifying as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

we expect to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our dividend distributions we generated cash flow from operations of approximately 6213 million and 6103 million for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively we paid 3916 million and 3768 million to our common stock and unit holders for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively 

we estimate that we will require capital during the next twelve months of approximately 3912 million to fund construction and related costs for inprocess developments and redevelopments to repay maturing debt and to make capital contributions to our coinvestment partnerships we expect to generate the necessary cash to fund our capital needs from future cash flow from operations after dividends paid borrowings from our line proceeds from the sale of real estate and when the capital markets are favorable proceeds from the sale of equity or the issuance of new debt

if we start new developments or redevelopments commit to new acquisitions prepay debt prior to maturity or repurchase shares of our common stock our cash requirements will increase in addition at december 31 2019 we had an agreement related to our ownership interest in the town and country center in los angeles ca to purchase an additional 1662 ownership interest in this center for approximately 181 million we closed on the purchase in january 2020 

we endeavor to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets as of december 31 2019 886 of our whollyowned real estate assets were unencumbered such assets allow us to access the secured and unsecured debt markets and to maintain availability on the line 

our annualized fixed charge coverage ratio including our prorata share of our partnerships was 43 times and 42 times for the periods ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively

our line term loan and unsecured debt require that we remain in compliance with various covenants which are described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements we are in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2019 and expect to remain in compliance

critical accounting estimates 

knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial statements the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities as of a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period these accounting estimates are based upon but not limited to our judgments about historical and expected future results current market conditions and interpretation of industry accounting standards they are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness however the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates

accounts receivable and straight line rent

lease income which includes base rent percentage rent and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs insurance and real estate taxes are the companys principal source of revenue as a result of generating this revenue we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants additionally we recognize lease income on a straight line basis over the term of the lease which generally results in straight line rent receivable for future contractual rent steps 

lease income for operating leases with fixed payment terms is recognized on a straightline basis over the expected term of the lease for all leases for which collectibility is considered probable at the commencement date at lease commencement the company generally expects that collectibility is probable due to the company’s credit assessment of tenants and other creditworthiness analysis undertaken before entering into a new lease therefore income from most operating leases is initially recognized on a straightline basis for operating leases in which collectibility of lease income is not considered probable lease income is recognized on a cash basis and all previously recognized uncollectible lease income is reversed in the period in which the lease income is determined not to be probable of collection in addition to the leasespecific collectibility assessment performed under topic 842 the company also recognizes a general reserve as a reduction to lease income for its portfolio of operating lease receivables which are not expected to be fully collectible based on the company’s historical collection experience although we estimate uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income actual experience may differ from those estimates

real estate investments

acquisition of real estate investments

upon acquisition of real estate operating properties the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land building building improvements and tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and belowmarket leases and inplace leases assumed debt and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date based on these estimates the company allocates the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities transaction costs associated with asset acquisitions are capitalized while such costs are expensed for business combinations in the period incurred beginning in july 2017 the company adopted accounting standard update 201701 business combinations topic 805 clarifying the definition of a business  under which the acquisition of operating properties are generally considered asset acquisitions if however the acquisition is determined to be a business combination any excess consideration above the fair value allocated to the applicable assets and liabilities results in goodwill fair value is determined based on an exit price approach which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 

the companys methodology for determining fair value of the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities includes estimating an “asif vacant” fair value of the physical property which includes land building and improvements in addition the company determines the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets and liabilities considering the following categories i value of inplace leases and ii above and belowmarket value of inplace leases

the value of inplace leases is estimated based on the value associated with the costs avoided in originating leases compared to the acquired inplace leases as well as the value associated with lost rental and recovery revenue during the assumed leaseup period the value of inplace leases is recorded to depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the remaining expected term of the respective leases 

abovemarket and belowmarket inplace lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the inplace leases and ii managements estimate of fair market lease rates for comparable inplace leases measured over a period equal to the remaining noncancelable term of the lease including belowmarket renewal options if applicable the value of abovemarket leases is amortized as a reduction of lease income over the remaining terms of the respective leases and the value of belowmarket leases is accreted to lease income over the remaining terms of the respective leases including belowmarket renewal options if applicable

changes to these assumptions could result in a different pattern of recognition if tenants do not remain in their lease through the expected term or exercise an assumed renewal option there could be a material impact to earnings 

 

development and redevelopment of real estate assets and cost capitalization 

we have a development program which includes development of new shopping centers and redevelopment of our existing shopping centers we capitalize the acquisition of land the construction of buildings and other specifically identifiable development costs incurred by recording them in real estate assets at cost in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets other specifically identifiable development costs include predevelopment costs essential to the development process as well as interest real estate taxes and direct employee costs incurred during the development period once a development property is substantially complete and held available for occupancy these indirect costs are no longer capitalized









valuation of real estate investments

in accordance with gaap we evaluate our real estate for impairment whenever there are indicators including property operating performance and general market conditions that the carrying value of our real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may not be recoverable if such indicators occur we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions including rental rates expected leasing activity costs of tenant improvements leasing commissions anticipated hold period comparable sales information and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition including the exit capitalization rate these key assumptions are subjective in nature and the resulting impairment if any could differ from the actual gain or loss recognized upon ultimate sale in an arms length transaction if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value 

the fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available as well as the use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the discounted cash flow approach such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other factors and therefore is subject to management judgment and changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land we generally use market data and comparable sales information changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the companys financial condition or operating performance 

we evaluate our investments in real estate partnerships for impairment whenever there are indicators including underlying property operating performance and general market conditions that the value of our investments in real estate partnerships may be impaired an investment in a real estate partnership is considered impaired only if we determine that its fair value is less than the net carrying value of the investment in that real estate partnerships on an otherthantemporary basis cash flow projections for the investments consider property level factors such as expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other factors we consider various qualitative factors to determine if a decrease in the value of our investment is otherthantemporary these factors include the age of the real estate partnerships our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity and the financial condition and longterm prospects of the entity if we believe that the decline in the fair value of the investment is temporary no impairment charge is recorded if our analysis indicates that there is an otherthantemporary impairment related to the investment in a particular real estate partnership the carrying value of the investment will be adjusted to an amount that reflects the estimated fair value of the investment

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 to consolidated financial statements

environmental matters 

we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining primarily to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers underground petroleum storage tanks and other historic land use practices we believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations generally we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to more environmentally friendly systems where available we have been accepted into statesponsored environmental programs we have a blanket environmental insurance policy for thirdparty liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination we have also placed environmental insurance where possible on specific properties with known contamination in order to mitigate our environmental risk we monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites we also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so

as of december 31 2019 we and our investments in real estate partnerships had accrued liabilities of 94 million for our prorata share of environmental remediation we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations however we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities that any previous owner occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants by the condition of nearby properties or by unrelated third parties or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have offbalance sheet arrangements financings or other relationships with other unconsolidated entities other than our unconsolidated investment partnerships or other persons also known as variable interest entities not previously discussed many of our unconsolidated investment partnerships’ operating properties have been financed with nonrecourse loans to which we have no repayment guarantees 

inflationdeflation 

inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers however inflation may become a greater concern in the near future most all of our longterm leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation which require tenants to pay their prorata share of operating expenses including commonarea maintenance real estate taxes insurance and utilities thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation in addition many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years which permits us to seek increased rents upon rerental at market rates however during deflationary periods or periods of economic weakness base rents and percentage rents will decline as the supply of available retail space exceeds demand and consumer spending declines occupancy declines will result in lower recovery rates of our operating expenses

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

we are exposed to two significant components of interest rate risk





we continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt to repay maturing debt or fund our commitments based upon the current capital markets our credit ratings our capacity under our unsecured credit facilities and the number of high quality unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings we expect that we will be able to successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund maturing debt obligations

our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the table below presents the principal cash flows weighted average interest rates of remaining debt and the fair value of total debt as of december 31 2019 for variable rate mortgages and unsecured credit facilities for which we have interest rate swaps in place to fix the interest rate they are included in the fixed rate debt section below at their allin fixed rate the table is presented by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes although the average interest rate for variable rate debt is included in the table those rates represent rates that existed as of december 31 2019 and are subject to change on a monthly basis in addition the company continually assesses the market risk for its floating rate debt and believes that a 1 increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 26 million per year based on 351 million of floating rate mortgage debt and 2200 million of floating rate line of credit balance outstanding at december 31 2019 if the company increases its line of credit balance in the future additional decreases to future earnings and cash flows could occur

further the table below incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2019 and does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date since firm commitments are not presented the table has limited predictive value as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at that time and actual interest rates

the table below presents the principal cash flow payments associated with our outstanding debt by year weighted average interest rates on debt outstanding at each yearend and fair value of total debt as of december 31 2019

competition 

we are among the largest owners of shopping centers in the nation based on revenues number of properties gla and market capitalization there are numerous companies and individuals engaged in the ownership development acquisition and operation of shopping centers that compete with us in our targeted markets including grocery store chains that also anchor some of our shopping centers this results in competition for attracting tenants as well as the acquisition of existing shopping centers and new development sites we believe that our competitive advantages are driven by 

 employees 

our corporate headquarters are located at one independent drive suite 114 jacksonville florida we presently maintain 22 market offices nationwide including our corporate headquarters where we conduct management leasing construction and investment activities we have 446 employees throughout the united states and we believe that our relations with our employees are good 

compliance with governmental regulations 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate certain hazardous or toxic substances at our shopping centers these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances the cost of required remediation and the owners liability for remediation could exceed the value of the property andor the aggregate assets of the owner the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral although we have a number of properties that could require or are currently undergoing varying levels of environmental remediation known environmental remediation is not currently expected to have a material financial impact on us due to insurance programs designed to mitigate the cost of remediation various stateregulated programs that shift the responsibility and cost to the state and existing accrued liabilities for remediation

defined terms 

 in addition to the required generally accepted accounting principles gaap presentations we use certain nongaap performance measures as we believe these measures improve the understanding of the companys operational results we continually evaluate the usefulness relevance limitations and calculation of our reported nongaap performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public and thus such reported measures could change 

the following terms as defined are commonly used by management and the investing public to understand and evaluate our operational results 

 we manage our entire real estate portfolio without regard to ownership structure although certain decisions impacting properties owned through partnerships require partner approval therefore we believe presenting our prorata share of certain operating metrics along with other nongaap measures makes comparisons of other reits operating results to the companys more meaningful 

the prorata information is prepared on a basis consistent with the comparable consolidated amounts and is intended to more accurately reflect our proportionate economic interest in the operating results of properties in our portfolio we do not control the unconsolidated investment partnerships and the prorata presentations of the assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses do not represent our legal claim to such items the partners are entitled to profit or loss allocations and distributions of cash flows according to the operating agreements which provide for such allocations according to their invested capital our share of invested capital establishes the ownership interests we use to prepare our prorata share 

the presentation of prorata information has limitations which include but are not limited to the following 

 because of these limitations the prorata financial information should not be considered independently or as a substitute for our financial statements as reported under gaap we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap financial statements using the prorata information as a supplement

 item 1a risk factors 

risk factors related to the retail industry 

economic and market conditions may adversely affect the retail industry and consequently reduce our revenues and cash flow and increase our operating expenses 

our properties are leased primarily to retail tenants from whom we derive most of our revenue in the form of minimum rent expense recoveries and other income therefore our performance and operating results are directly linked to the economic and market conditions occurring in the retail industry we are subject to the risks that upon expiration leases for space in our properties are not renewed by existing tenants vacant space is not leased to new tenants or tenants demand new lease terms including costs for renovations or concessions the market for leasing retail space in our properties may be adversely affected by any of the following 

 to the extent that any of these conditions occur they are likely to impact the retail industry our retail tenants the demand and market rents for retail space the occupancy levels of our properties our ability to sell acquire or develop properties our operating results and our cash available for distributions to stock and unit holders 

the integration of bricks and mortar stores and ecommerce by retailers and a continued shift in retail sales towards ecommerce may adversely impact our revenues and cash flows 

retailers are increasingly impacted by ecommerce and changes in customer buying habits including the delivery or curbside pickup of items ordered online retailers are considering these ecommerce trends when making decisions regarding their bricks and mortar stores and how they will compete and innovate in a rapidly changing ecommerce environment many retailers in our shopping centers provide services or sell goods which have historically been less likely to be purchased online however the continuing increase in ecommerce sales in all retail categories may cause retailers to adjust the size or number of retail locations in the future or close stores our grocer tenants are incorporating ecommerce concepts through home delivery which could reduce foot traffic at our centers this shift may adversely impact our occupancy and rental rates which would impact our revenues and cash flows changes in shopping trends as a result of the growth in ecommerce may also impact the profitability of retailers that do not adapt to changes in market conditions these conditions may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows if we are unable to meet the needs of our tenants or if our tenants encounter financial difficulties as a result of changing market conditions 

our business is dependent on perceptions by retailers and shoppers of the safety convenience and attractiveness of our retail properties 

we are dependent on perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety convenience and attractiveness of our retail properties if retailers and shoppers perceive competing retail properties and other retailing options to be safer more convenient or of a higher quality our revenues may be adversely affected 

changing economic and retail market conditions in geographic areas where our properties are concentrated may reduce our revenues and cash flow 

economic conditions in markets where our properties are concentrated can greatly influence our financial performance during the year ended december 31 2018  our properties in california florida and texas accounted for 281  

 6 

201  and 71  respectively of our noi from consolidated properties plus our prorata share from unconsolidated properties prorata basis our revenues and cash flow may be adversely affected by this geographic concentration if market conditions such as supply of or demand for retail space deteriorate more significantly in california florida or texas compared to other geographic areas 

our success depends on the success and continued presence of our “anchor” tenants 

anchor tenants anchor tenants or anchors occupying 10000 square feet or more occupy large stores in our shopping centers pay a significant portion of the total rent at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by attracting shoppers to the property    we derive significant revenues from anchor tenants such as publix  kroger co  albertsons companies inc  whole foods  and tjx companies  who accounted for 32  30  28  24  and 23  respectively of our total annualized base rent on a prorata basis for the year ended december 31 2018  our net income and cash flow may be adversely affected by the loss of revenues and additional costs in the event a significant anchor tenant 

 

some anchors have the right to vacate their space and may prevent us from retenanting by continuing to comply and pay rent in accordance with their lease agreement vacated anchor space including space owned by the anchor can reduce rental revenues generated by the shopping center in other spaces because of the loss of the departed anchors customer drawing power if a significant tenant vacates a property cotenancy clauses in select lease contracts may allow other tenants to modify or terminate their rent or lease obligations cotenancy clauses have several variants they may allow a tenant to postpone a store opening if certain other tenants fail to open their stores they may allow a tenant to close its store prior to lease expiration if another tenant closes its store prior to lease expiration or more commonly they may allow a tenant to pay reduced levels of rent until a certain number of tenants open their stores within the same shopping center 

a significant percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller shop space tenants and our net income may be adversely impacted if our smaller shop tenants are not successful 

a significant percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller shop space tenants shop space tenants occupying less than 10000 square feet shop space tenants may be more vulnerable to negative economic conditions as they have more limited resources than anchor tenants shop space tenants may be facing reduced sales as a result of an increase in competition including from ecommerce retailers certain shop space tenants are incorporating ecommerce into their business strategies and may seek to reduce their store sizes upon lease expiration as they adjust to and implement alternative distribution channels the types of shop space tenants vary from retail shops and restaurants to service providers if we are unable to attract the right type or mix of shop space tenants into our centers our revenues and cash flow may be adversely impacted 

at december 31 2018  shop space tenants represent approximately 353  of our gla leased at average base rents of 3375  per square foot psf a onepercent decline in our shop space occupancy may result in a reduction to minimum rent of approximately 48 million  

we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy 

although minimum rent and recoveries from tenants are supported by longterm lease contracts tenants who file bankruptcy have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant for unpaid rent might be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold additionally we may incur significant expense to recover our claim and to release the vacated space in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and rejects its leases we may experience a significant reduction in our revenues and may not be able to collect all prepetition amounts owed by the bankrupt tenant

risk factors related to real estate investments and operations 

we are subject to numerous laws and regulations that may adversely affect our operations or expose us to liability 

our properties are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations some of which may conflict with one another or be subject to varying judicial or regulatory interpretations these laws and regulations may include zoning laws building codes competition laws rules and agreements landlordtenant laws property tax regulations changes in real estate assessments and other laws and regulations generally applicable to business operations noncompliance with such laws and regulations and any associated litigation may expose us to liability 

our real estate assets may decline in value and be subject to impairment losses which may reduce our net income 

our real estate properties are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable we evaluate whether there are any indicators including property operating performance and general market conditions such that the value of the real estate properties including any related tangible or intangible assets or liabilities including goodwill may not be recoverable through the evaluation we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions including rental rates costs of tenant improvements leasing commissions anticipated holding periods and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition including the exit capitalization rate these key assumptions are subjective in nature and may differ materially from actual results changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the holding period of an asset or asset group which may result in an impairment loss and such loss may be material to the companys financial condition or operating performance to the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value 

the fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is determined through the use of comparable sales information and other market data if available or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the traditional discounted cash flow approach such cash flow projections take into account expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other relevant criteria and therefore are subject to management judgment changes in these factors may impact the determination of fair value in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land we generally use market data and comparable sales information 

these subjective assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment charge results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income which may be material there can be no assurance that we will not record impairment charges in the future related to our assets 

we face risks associated with development redevelopment and expansion of properties 

we actively pursue opportunities for new retail development or existing property redevelopment or expansion development and redevelopment activities require various government and other approvals for entitlements and any delay in such approvals may significantly delay this process we may not recover our investment in development or redevelopment projects for which approvals are not received we are subject to other risks associated with these activities including the following risks 



 8 

 we face risks associated with the acquisition of properties 

our investment strategy includes investing in highquality shopping centers that are leased to marketdominant grocers categoryleading anchors specialty retailers or restaurants located in areas with high barriers to entry and above average household incomes and population densities the acquisition of properties andor real estate entities entails risks that include but are not limited to the following any of which may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

 we face risks if we expand into new markets 

if opportunities arise we may acquire or develop properties in markets where we currently have no presence each of the risks applicable to acquiring or developing properties in our current markets are applicable to acquiring developing and integrating properties in new markets in addition we may not possess the same level of familiarity with the dynamics and conditions of the new markets we may enter which may adversely affect our operating results and investment returns in those markets 

we may be unable to sell properties when desired because of market conditions 

our properties including their related tangible and intangible assets represent the majority of our total consolidated assets and they may not be readily convertible to cash as a result our ability to sell one or more of our properties including properties held in joint venture in response to changes in economic industry or other conditions may be limited the real estate market is affected by many factors such as general economic conditions availability and terms of financing interest rates and other factors including supply and demand for space that are beyond our control there may be less demand for lower quality properties that we have identified for ultimate disposition in markets with uncertain economic or retail environments and where buyers are more reliant on the availability of third party mortgage financing if we want to sell a property we can provide no assurance that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or at all or that the sales price of a property will be attractive at the relevant time or even exceed the carrying value of our investment moreover if a property is mortgaged we may not be able to obtain a release of the lien on that property without the payment of a substantial prepayment penalty which may restrict our ability to dispose of the property even though the sale might otherwise be desirable 

certain properties we own have a low tax basis which may result in a taxable gain on sale we intend to utilize 1031 exchanges to mitigate taxable income however there can be no assurance that we will identify properties that meet our investment objectives for acquisitions in the event that we do not utilize 1031 exchanges we may be required to distribute the gain proceeds to shareholders or pay income tax which may reduce our cash flow available to fund our commitments 

certain of the properties in our portfolio are subject to ground leases if we are found to be in breach of a ground lease or are unable to renew a ground lease we may be materially and adversely affected 

we have 29  properties in our portfolio that are either partially or completely on land subject to ground leases with third parties accordingly we only own a longterm leasehold or similar interest in those properties if we are found to be in breach of a ground lease we may lose our interest in the improvements and the right to operate the property that is subject to the ground lease in addition unless we can purchase a fee interest in the underlying land or extend the terms of these leases before or upon their expiration as to which no assurance can be given we will lose our interest in the improvements and the right to operate such properties the existing lease terms including renewal options were taken into consideration when making our investment decisions the purchase price and subsequent improvements are being depreciated over the shorter of the remaining 

 9 

life of the ground leases or the useful life of the underlying assets if we were to lose the right to operate a property due to a breach or not exercising renewal options of the ground lease we would be unable to derive income from such property which would impair the value of our investments and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

geographic concentration of our properties makes our business vulnerable to natural disasters severe weather conditions and climate change an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the insurance coverage on our properties may subject us to loss of capital and revenue on those properties 

a significant number of our properties are located in areas that are susceptible to earthquakes tropical storms hurricanes tornadoes wildfires sealevel rise and other natural disasters as of december 31 2018  25 of the total insured value of our portfolio is located in the state of california including a number of properties in the san francisco bay and los angeles areas additionally 19 and 6 of the total insured value of our portfolio is located in the states of florida and texas respectively recent intense weather conditions may cause property insurance premiums to increase significantly in the future we recognize that the frequency and  or intensity of extreme weather events sealevel rise and other climatic changes may continue to increase and as a result our exposure to these events may increase these weather conditions may disrupt our business and the business of our tenants which may affect the ability of some tenants to pay rent and may reduce the willingness of tenants or residents to remain in or move to these affected areas therefore as a result of the geographic concentration of our properties we face risks including higher costs such as uninsured property losses and higher insurance premiums and disruptions to our business and the businesses of our tenants 

we carry comprehensive liability fire flood terrorism rental loss and environmental insurance for our properties with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties some types of losses such as losses from named wind storms earthquakes terrorism or wars may have limited coverage or be excluded from insurance coverage although we carry specific insurance coverage for named windstorm and earthquake losses the policies are subject to deductibles up to 2 to 5 of the total insured value of each property up to a 10 million maximum deductible per occurrence for each of these perils with limits of 300 million per occurrence for all perils except earthquake which has a total annual aggregate limit of 300 million terrorism coverage is limited to 200 million per occurrence related to property damage liability claims are limited to 151 million per occurrence should a loss occur at any of our properties that is subject to a substantial deductible or is in excess of the property or casualty insurance limits of our policies we may lose part or all of our invested capital and revenues from such property which may have a material adverse impact on our operating results financial condition and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders 

to the extent climate change causes adverse changes in weather patterns our properties in certain markets may experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea‑levels climate change may result in volatile or decreased demand for retail space at certain of our properties or in extreme cases our inability to operate certain properties at all climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of insurance on favorable terms or making insurance unavailable moreover compliance with new laws or regulations related to climate change including compliance with “green” building codes may require us to make improvements to our existing properties or increase taxes and fees assessed on us or our properties at this time there can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on us 

terrorist activities or violence occurring at our properties also may directly affect the value of our properties through damage destruction or loss insurance for such acts may be unavailable or cost more resulting in an increase to our operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations to the extent that our tenants are affected by such attacks and threats of attacks their businesses may be adversely affected including their ability to continue to meet obligations under their existing leases 

loss of our key personnel may adversely affect our business and operations 

the success of our business depends in part on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees and our ability to attract retain and motivate talented employees may significantly impact our future performance competition for these individuals is intense and we cannot be assured that we will retain all of our executive management team and other key employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals for these positions in the future losing any one or more of these persons may have a material adverse effect on us 

we face competition from numerous sources including other reits and other real estate owners 

the ownership of shopping centers is highly fragmented we face competition from other public reits large private investors institutional investors and from numerous small owners in the acquisition ownership and leasing of shopping centers we also compete to develop shopping centers with other reits engaged in development activities as well as with local regional and national real estate developers this competition may 

 10 

 if we cannot successfully compete in our targeted markets our cash flow and therefore distributions to stock and unit holders may be adversely affected 

costs of environmental remediation may reduce our cash flow available for distribution to stock and unit holders 

under various federal state and local laws an owner or manager of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on the property these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances the cost of any required remediation may exceed the value of the property andor the aggregate assets of the owner or the responsible party the presence of or the failure to properly remediate hazardous or toxic substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a contaminated property or to use the property as collateral for a loan we can provide no assurance that we are aware of all potential environmental liabilities that any previous owner occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us that our properties will not be affected by tenants or nearby properties or other unrelated third parties and that future uses or conditions or changes in environmental laws and regulations will not result in additional material environmental liabilities to us 

compliance with the americans with disabilities act and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures 

all of our properties are required to comply with the americans with disabilities act “ada” which generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities compliance with ada requirements may require removal of access barriers and noncompliance may result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants or both while the tenants to whom we lease space in our properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions and typically under tenant leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these tenants to cover costs may be adversely affected in addition we are required to operate the properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations as they may be adopted by governmental entities and become applicable to the properties we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with these requirements and these expenditures may have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our financial obligations and make distributions to our stock and unit holders 

the unauthorized access use theft or destruction of tenant or employee personal financial or other data or of regency’s proprietary or confidential information stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues 

many of our information technology systems including those we use for administration accounting and communications as well as the systems of our coinvestment partners and other thirdparty business partners and service providers whether cloudbased or hosted in proprietary servers contain personal financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our tenants and employees many of our information technology systems also contain proprietary regency information and other confidential information related to our business we are frequently subject to attempts to compromise our information technology systems to the extent we or a third party were to experience a material breach of our or such third party’s information technology systems that result in the unauthorized access theft use destruction or other compromises of tenants’ or employees data or confidential information of the company stored in such systems including through cyberattacks or other external or internal methods such a breach may damage our reputation and cause us to lose tenants and revenues generate third party claims and the potential disruption to our business and plans such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable us privacy and other laws and subject us to private consumer business partner or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability and we may not be able to recover these expenses from our service providers responsible parties or insurance carriers 

the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyberattacks and breaches of information technology systems as well as the sources and targets of these attacks change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time the company manages cyber risk by evaluating the impact of a potential cyber breach on our business and determining the level of investment in the prevention detection and response to a breach we continue to make significant investments in technology thirdparty services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyberattacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss 

 11 

risk factors related to our partnerships and joint ventures 

we do not have voting control over properties owned in our coinvestment partnerships and joint ventures so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued 

we have invested substantial capital as a partner in a number of partnerships and joint ventures to acquire own lease develop or redevelop properties these activities are subject to the same risks as our investments in our whollyowned properties these investments and other future similar investments may involve risks that would not be present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or other owners might become bankrupt suffer a deterioration in their creditworthiness or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions partners or other owners may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our own business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives 

these investments and other future similar investments also have the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions such as a sale or financing because neither we nor our partner or other owner has full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or other owners might result in litigation or arbitration that may increase our expenses and prevent management from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or other owners might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we risk the possibility of being liable for the actions of our partners or other owners these factors may limit the return that we receive from such investments or cause our cash flows to be lower than our estimates 

the termination of our partnerships may adversely affect our cash flow operating results and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders 

if partnerships owning a significant number of properties were dissolved for any reason we could lose the asset property management leasing and construction management fees from these partnerships which may adversely affect our operating results and our cash available for distribution to stock and unit holders 

risk factors related to funding strategies and capital structure 

higher market capitalization rates and lower noi at our properties may adversely impact our ability to sell properties and fund developments and acquisitions and may dilute earnings 

as part of our funding strategy we sell operating properties that no longer meet our investment standards or those with a limited future growth profile these sales proceeds are used to fund the construction of new developments redevelopments and repay debt and acquisitions an increase in market capitalization rates or a decline in noi may cause a reduction in the value of centers identified for sale which would have an adverse impact on the amount of cash generated in order to meet the cash requirements of our development program we may be required to sell more properties than initially planned which may have a negative impact on our earnings additionally the sale of properties resulting in significant tax gains may require higher distributions to our stockholders or payment of additional income taxes in order to maintain our reit status we intend to utilize 1031 exchanges to mitigate taxable income however there can be no assurance that we will identify properties that meet our investment objectives for acquisitions 

we depend on external sources of capital which may not be available in the future on favorable terms or at all 

to qualify as a reit the parent company must among other things distribute to its stockholders each year at least 90 of its reit taxable income excluding any net capital gains because of these distribution requirements we may not be able to fund all future capital needs with income from operations we therefore will have to rely on thirdparty sources of capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all our access to thirdparty sources of capital depends on a number of things including the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings our access to debt depends on our credit rating the willingness of creditors to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets in addition to finding creditors willing to lend to us we are dependent upon our joint venture partners to contribute their pro rata share of any amount needed to repay or refinance existing debt when lenders reduce the amount of debt our partnerships and joint ventures are eligible to refinance 

in addition our existing debt arrangements also impose covenants that limit our flexibility in obtaining other financing additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders interests and additional debt financing may substantially increase our degree of leverage 

without access to external sources of capital we would be required to pay outstanding debt with our operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales our operating cash flows may not be sufficient to pay our outstanding debt as it comes due and real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly at a return we believe is appropriate if we are required to 

 12 

deleverage our business with operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales we may be forced to reduce the amount of or eliminate altogether our distributions to stock and unit holders or refrain from making investments in our business 

our debt financing may adversely affect our business and financial condition 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance which to a certain extent is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control in addition we do not expect to generate sufficient operating cash flow to make balloon principal payments on our debt when due if we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms we may be forced i to dispose of properties which might result in losses or ii to obtain financing at unfavorable terms either of which may reduce the cash flow available for distributions to stock and unit holders if we cannot make required mortgage payments the mortgagee may foreclose on the property securing the mortgage 

covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition 

our unsecured notes unsecured term loans and unsecured line of credit contain customary covenants including compliance with financial ratios such as ratio of total debt to gross asset value and fixed charge coverage ratio fixed charge coverage ratio is defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda divided by the sum of interest expense and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders if any these covenants may limit our operational flexibility and our acquisition activities moreover if we breach any of the covenants in our debt agreements and do not cure the breach within the applicable cure period our lenders may require us to repay the debt immediately even in the absence of a payment default many of our debt arrangements including our unsecured notes unsecured term loans and unsecured line of credit are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other material debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants may have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our stock 

the interest rates on our unsecured credit facilities as well as on our variable rate mortgages and interest rate swaps might change based on changes to the method in which libor or its replacement rate is determined 

libor the london interbank offered rate is the basic rate of interest used in lending transactions between banks on the london interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally we have unsecured credit facilities variable rate mortgages and interest rate swaps with variable interest rates or options for such that are based upon an annual rate of libor plus a spread libor rates charged on such debt and swaps change monthly 

on july 27 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 the alternative reference rates committee arrc a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions has proposed replacing usdlibor with a new index calculated by short term repurchase agreements  the secured overnight financing rate sofr the replacement for libor at this time is still uncertain 

if libor ceases to exist the administrative agent under our line of credit may to the extent practicable and with our consent but subject to certain objection rights on the part of the line lenders establish a replacement rate for libor which must be determined generally in accordance with similar situations in other transactions in which it is serving as administrative agent or otherwise consistent with market practice generally establishing a replacement rate for libor in this manner may result in interest obligations which are more than or do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would have been made on the line if libor was available in its current form our other debt based upon libor will experience similar types of adjustments such adjustments could have an adverse impact on our financing costs 

increases in interest rates would cause our borrowing costs to rise and negatively impact our results of operations 

although a significant amount of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates we do borrow funds at variable interest rates under our credit facilities and term loans as of december 31 2018  49  of our outstanding debt was variable rate debt increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense on any variable rate debt to the extent we have not hedged our exposure to changes in interest rates in addition increases in interest rates will affect the terms under which we refinance our existing debt as it matures to the extent we have not hedged our exposure to changes in interest rates this would reduce our future earnings and cash flows which may adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also may reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our stock and unit holders 

 13 

hedging activity may expose us to risks including the risks that a counterparty will not perform and that the hedge will not yield the economic benefits we anticipate which may adversely affect us 

from time to time we manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements that involve risk such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements and that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes there can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will qualify for hedge accounting or that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations should we desire to terminate a hedging agreement there may be significant costs and cash requirements involved to fulfill our obligations under the hedging agreement failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations 

we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through taxdeferred contribution transactions which may result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell such assets 

we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in our operating partnership which may result in stockholder dilution this acquisition structure may have the effect of among other things reducing the amount of tax depreciation we may deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties and may require that we agree to protect the contributors’ ability to defer recognition of taxable gain through restrictions on our ability to dispose of the acquired properties andor the allocation of partnership debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases these restrictions may limit our ability to sell an asset at a time or on terms that would be favorable absent such restrictions 

risk factors related to our company and the market price for our securities 

changes in economic and market conditions may adversely affect the market price of our securities 

the market price of our debt and equity securities may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors many of which are out of our control including 

 these factors may cause the market price of our securities to decline regardless of our financial condition results of operations business or prospects it is impossible to ensure that the market price of our securities including our common stock will not fall in the future a decrease in the market price of our common stock may reduce our ability to raise additional equity in the public markets selling common stock at a decreased market price would have a dilutive impact on existing stockholders 

there is no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates 

our ability to continue to pay dividends at historical rates or to increase our dividend rate will depend on a number of factors including among others the following 



 14 

if we do not maintain or periodically increase the dividend on our common stock it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and other securities 

corporate responsibility specifically related to environmental social and governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks 

regency as well as investors are focused on corporate responsibility specifically related to environmental social and governance factors some investors may use these factors to guide their investment strategies thirdparty providers of corporate responsibility ratings and reports on companies have increased to meet growing investor demand for measurement of corporate responsibility performance although we have scored highly in these metrics to date there can be no assurance that we will continue to score highly in the future in addition the criteria by which companies are rated may change which could cause us to perform worse than in the past we may face reputational damage in the event our corporate responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by various constituencies furthermore should our competitors outperform us in such metrics potential or current investors may elect to invest with our competition instead the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on the price of our shares and our business financial condition and results of operations including increased capital expenditures and or increased operating expenses 

risk factors related to laws and regulations 

if the parent company fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes it would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 

we believe that the parent company qualifies for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes and we plan to operate so that we can continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit if the parent company continues to qualify as a reit it generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders many reit requirements however are highly technical and complex the determination that the parent company is a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances some of which may not be totally within our control and some of which involve questions of interpretation for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income must come from specific passive sources like rent that are itemized in the reit tax laws there can be no assurance that the internal revenue service “irs” or a court would agree with the positions we have taken in interpreting the reit requirements we are also required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains we will be subject to us federal income tax on our undistributed taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years the fact that we hold many of our assets through coinvestment partnerships and their subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements furthermore congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult for the parent company to remain qualified as a reit 

also unless the irs granted relief under certain statutory provisions the parent company would remain disqualified as a reit for four years following the year it first failed to qualify if the parent company failed to qualify as a reit currently andor with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired we would have to pay significant income taxes reducing cash available to pay dividends which would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to pay any dividends to stockholders in order to maintain our reit status although we believe that the parent company qualifies as a reit we cannot be assured that the parent company will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes 

even if the parent company qualifies as a reit for federal income tax purposes we are required to pay certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from “prohibited transactions” that income will be subject to a 100 tax in general prohibited transactions include sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business the determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale while we have undertaken a significant number of asset sales in recent years we do not believe that those sales should be considered prohibited transactions but there can be no assurance that the irs would not contend otherwise 

new legislation as well as new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may be introduced enacted or promulgated from time to time that may change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification in a manner that is adverse to our stockholders 

 15 

recent changes to the us tax laws may have a significant negative impact on the overall economy our tenants our investors and our business 

the tax cuts and jobs act made significant changes to the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code while the changes in the tax cuts and jobs act generally appear to be favorable with respect to reits the extensive changes to nonreit provisions in the code may have unanticipated effects on us or our stockholders including our taxable income the amount of distributions to our stockholders required in order to maintain our reit status and our relative tax advantage as a reit the longterm impact of the tax cuts and jobs act on the overall economy government revenues our tenants us and the real estate industry cannot be reliably predicted at this stage of the new law’s implementation furthermore the tax cuts and jobs act may negatively impact certain of our tenants’ operating results financial condition and future business plans the tax cuts and jobs act may also result in reduced government revenues and therefore reduced government spending which may negatively impact some of our tenants that rely on government funding there can be no assurance that the tax cuts and jobs act will not negatively impact our operating results financial condition and future business operations 

dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates 

subject to limited exceptions dividends paid by reits other than distributions designated as capital gain dividends qualified dividends or returns of capital are not eligible for reduced rates for qualified dividends paid by c corporations and are taxable at ordinary income tax rates the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends may cause investors who are individuals trusts and estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which may adversely affect the value of the shares of reits including the shares of our capital stock 

under the recently passed tax cuts and jobs act the rate brackets for noncorporate taxpayer’s ordinary income are adjusted the top tax rate is reduced from 396 to 37 excluding the 38 medicare tax on net investment income and ordinary reit dividends are taxed at even lower effective rates under the tax cuts and jobs act for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2026 distributions from reits that are treated as dividends but are not designated as qualified dividends or capital gain dividends are generally taxed as ordinary income after deducting 20 of the amount of the dividend in the case of noncorporate stockholders at the maximum ordinary income tax rate of 37 applicable for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2026 the maximum tax rate on ordinary reit dividends for noncorporate stockholders is generally 296 plus the 38 medicare tax on net investment income 

foreign stockholders may be subject to us federal income tax on gain recognized on a disposition of our common stock if we do not qualify as a domestically controlled reit 

a foreign person disposing of a us real property interest including shares of a us corporation whose assets consist principally of us real property interests is generally subject to us federal income tax on any gain recognized on the disposition this tax does not apply however to the disposition of stock in a reit if the reit is domestically controlled in general we will be a domestically controlled reit if at all times during the fiveyear period ending on the applicable stockholder’s disposition of our stock less than 50 in value of our stock was held directly or indirectly by nonus persons if we were to fail to qualify as a domestically controlled reit gain recognized by a foreign stockholder on a disposition of our common stock would be subject to us federal income tax unless our common stock was traded on an established securities market and the foreign stockholder did not at any time during a specified testing period directly or indirectly own more than 10 of our outstanding common stock 

legislative or other actions affecting reits may have a negative effect on us 

the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us department of the treasury changes to the tax laws with or without retroactive application may adversely affect regency or our investors we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect regency or our investors new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us also the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities or an investment in other entities may change making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit 

complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities 

the reit provisions of the code limit our ability to hedge our liabilities generally income from a hedging transaction that constitutes “qualifying income” for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests applicable to reits does not constitute “gross income” for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests provided that we properly identify the 

 16 

hedging transaction pursuant to the applicable sections of the code and treasury regulations to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions or fail to make the proper tax identifications the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests as a result of these rules we may need to limit our use of otherwise advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a taxable reit subsidiary trs 

changes in accounting standards may impact our financial results 

the financial accounting standards board fasb in conjunction with the sec has several key projects recently completed that will impact how we currently account for our material transactions including lease accounting accounting standards codification asc topic 842 leases  will be adopted by the company on january 1 2019 and as further described in note 1o is expected to have an impact on our financial statements when adopted to require all of our operating leases for office ground and equipment leases to be recorded on our balance sheet also we will no longer capitalize internal leasing compensation costs and legal costs associated with leasing activities under the new standard which will result in an increase in our general and administrative costs and a direct reduction to our net income 

restrictions on the ownership of the parent companys capital stock to preserve its reit status may delay or prevent a change in control

our leases for tenant space under 10000 square feet generally have initial terms ranging from three to seven years leases greater than 10000 square feet generally have initial lease terms in excess of five years mostly comprised of anchor tenants many of the anchor leases contain provisions allowing the tenant the option of extending the term of the lease at expiration our leases typically provide for the payment of fixed minimum rent the tenants prorata share of real estate taxes insurance and common area maintenance “cam” expenses and reimbursement for utility costs if not directly metered

the following table summarizes prorata lease expirations for the next ten years and thereafter for our consolidated and unconsolidated properties assuming no tenants renew their leases gla and dollars in thousands 



during 2019  we have a total of 1014  leases expiring representing 31 million  square feet of gla these expiring leases have an average base rent of 2084  psf the average base rent of new leases signed during 2018  was 2715  psf during periods of recession or when occupancy is low tenants have more bargaining power which may result in rental rate declines on new or renewal leases in periods of recovery andor when occupancy levels are high landlords have more bargaining power which generally results in rental rate growth on new and renewal leases based on current economic trends and expectations the quality and mix of tenants in our centers and prorata percent leased of 956  we expect average base rent on new and renewal leases during 2019  to meet or exceed average rental rates on leases expiring in 2019  exceptions may arise in certain geographic areas or at specific shopping centers based on the local economic situation competition location quality and size of the space being leased among other factors additionally significant changes or uncertainties affecting micro or macroeconomic climates may cause significant changes to our current expectations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executing on our strategy 

we reported net income attributable to common stockholders of 2491 million  during the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to 1599 million  net of 807 million of merger costs during the same period in 2017 

we sustained superior same property noi growth 

 we developed and redeveloped high quality shopping centers at attractive returns on investment 

 we maintained a conservative balance sheet providing financial flexibility to cost effectively fund investment opportunities and debt maturities

leasing activity and significant tenants 

we believe our highquality grocery anchored shopping centers located in densely populated desirable infill trade areas create attractive spaces for retail tenants 

prorata occupancy 

the following table summarizes prorata occupancy rates of our combined consolidated and unconsolidated shopping center portfolio

total weighted average base rent on signed shop space leases during 2018  was 3345  psf and exceeds the average annual base rent of all shop space leases due to expire during the next 12 months of 3062 psf 

significant tenants and concentrations of risk 

we seek to reduce our operating and leasing risks through geographic diversification and by avoiding dependence on any single property market or tenant the following table summarizes our most significant tenants based on their percentage of annualized base rent 



bankruptcies and credit concerns 

our management team devotes significant time to researching and monitoring retail trends consumer preferences customer shopping behaviors changes in retail delivery methods and changing demographics in order to anticipate the challenges and opportunities impacting the retail industry a greater shift to ecommerce largescale retail business failures unemployment and tight credit markets could negatively impact consumer spending and have an adverse effect on our results of operations we seek to mitigate these potential impacts through tenant diversification retenanting weaker tenants with stronger operators anchoring our centers with market leading grocery stores that drive foot traffic and maintaining a presence in affluent suburbs and dense infill trade areas as a result of our research and findings we may reduce new leasing suspend leasing or curtail allowances for construction of leasehold improvements within a certain retail category or to a specific retailer in order to reduce our risk from bankruptcies and store closings 

we closely monitor the operating performance and rent collections of tenants in our shopping centers as well as those retailers experiencing significant changes to their business models as a result of reduced customer traffic in their stores and increased competition from ecommerce sales retailers who are unable to withstand these and other business pressures may file for bankruptcy although base rent is supported by longterm lease contracts tenants who file bankruptcy generally have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant for unpaid rent might be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold additionally we may incur significant expense to recover our claim and to release the vacated space in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues tenants who have filed for bankruptcy and continue to occupy space at december 31 2018  in our shopping centers represent an aggregate of 04 of our annual base rent on a prorata basis

supplemental earnings information 

we use certain nongaap performance measures in addition to certain performance metrics determined under gaap as we believe these measures improve the understanding of the companys operating results we manage our entire real estate portfolio without regard to ownership structure although certain decisions impacting properties owned through partnerships require partner approval therefore we believe presenting our prorata share of operating results regardless of ownership structure along with other nongaap measures may assist in comparing the companys operating results to other reits we continually evaluate the usefulness relevance limitations and calculation of our reported nongaap performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public and thus such reported measures could change see defined terms in part i item 1

liquidity and capital resources 

general 

we use cash flows generated from operating investing and financing activities to strengthen our balance sheet finance our development and redevelopment projects fund our investment activities and maintain financial flexibility we continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt or equity to repay maturing debt or fund our capital commitments 

except for 500 million of unsecured public and private placement debt our parent company has no capital commitments other than its guarantees of the commitments of our operating partnership the operating partnership is a coissuer and a guarantor on the 500 million of outstanding debt of our parent company all remaining debt is held by our operating partnership or by our coinvestment partnerships the parent company will from time to time access the capital markets for the purpose of issuing new equity and will simultaneously contribute all of the offering proceeds to the operating partnership in exchange for additional partnership units based upon our available sources of capital our current credit ratings and the number of high quality unencumbered properties we own we believe our available capital resources are sufficient to meet our expected capital needs 

in addition to our 425 million  of unrestricted cash at december 31 2018  the company has the following additional sources of capital available 



our dividend distribution policy is set by our board of directors who monitors our financial position our board of directors recently declared a common stock dividend of 0585  per share payable on march 7 2019  to shareholders of record as of february 25 2019  future dividends will be declared at the discretion of our board of directors and will be subject to capital requirements and availability we plan to continue paying an aggregate amount of distributions to our stock and unit holders that at a minimum meet the requirements to continue qualifying as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

we expect to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our dividend distributions we generated cash flow from operations of approximately 6103 million  and 4698 million  for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively we paid 3768 million  and 3283 million  to our common and preferred stock and unit holders for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively we currently do not have any preferred shares or units issued and outstanding 

to meet our additional cash requirements beyond our dividend we will utilize the following 



 52 

during the next twelve months we estimate that we will require approximately 1718 million of cash to fund the following 

 if we start new developments redevelop additional shopping centers commit to new acquisitions prepay debt prior to maturity or repurchase shares of our common stock our cash requirements will increase if we refinance maturing debt our cash requirements will decrease in addition we have a contractual commitment to purchase through december 2019 up to an additional 906 ownership interest in an operating shopping center we currently expect the seller to require us to purchase an additional 256 ownership interest in the property by december 2019 for approximately 275 million 

we endeavor to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets as of december 31 2018  878 of our whollyowned real estate assets were unencumbered such assets allow us to access the secured and unsecured debt markets and to maintain availability on the line our annualized fixed charge coverage ratio including our prorata share of our partnerships was 42 and 41 times for the periods ended december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively 

our line term loans and unsecured loans require that we remain in compliance with various covenants which are described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements we are in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2018  and expect to remain in compliance

critical accounting estimates 

knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial statements the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities as of a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period these accounting estimates are based upon but not limited to our judgments about historical and expected future results current market conditions and interpretation of industry accounting standards they are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness however the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates 

accounts receivable and straight line rent 

minimum rent percentage rent and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs insurance and real estate taxes are the companys principal source of revenue as a result of generating this revenue we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants we are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that may affect the collection of outstanding receivables to address the collectability of these receivables we analyze historical tenant collection rates writeoff experience tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts and straight line rent reserve although we estimate uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income actual experience may differ from those estimates

real estate investments 

acquisition of real estate investments 

upon acquisition of real estate operating properties the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land building building improvements and tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and belowmarket leases and inplace leases assumed debt and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date based on these estimates the company allocates the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities if the acquisition is determined to be a business combination any excess consideration above the fair value allocated to the applicable assets and liabilities results in goodwill fair value is determined based on an exit price approach which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date transaction costs associated with asset acquisitions are capitalized while such costs are expensed for business combinations in the period incurred 

we strategically coinvest with partners to own manage acquire develop and redevelop operating properties we analyze our investments in real estate partnerships in order to determine whether the entity should be consolidated the company consolidates partnerships in which it owns less than 100 but which it controls control is determined using an evaluation based on accounting standards related to the consolidation of variable interest entities vies and voting interest entities for joint ventures that are determined to be a vie the company consolidates the entity where it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary determination of the primary beneficiary is based on whether an entity has 1 the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and 2 the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie management uses its judgment when making these determinations we use the equity method of accounting for investments in real estate partnerships when we have significant influence but do not have a controlling financial interest under the equity method we record our investments in and advances to these entities as investments in real estate partnerships in our consolidated balance sheets and our proportionate share of earnings or losses earned by the partnership is recognized in equity in income loss of investments in real estate partnerships in our consolidated statements of operations 

development and redevelopment of real estate assets and cost capitalization 

we have a development program which includes redevelopment of our existing properties we capitalize the acquisition of land the construction of buildings and other specifically identifiable development costs incurred by recording them in real estate assets at cost in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets other specifically identifiable development costs include predevelopment costs essential to the development process as well as interest real estate taxes and direct employee costs incurred during the development period once a development property is substantially complete and held available for occupancy these indirect costs are no longer capitalized 



 61 

valuation of real estate investments 

in accordance with gaap we evaluate our real estate for impairment whenever there are indicators including property operating performance and general market conditions that the carrying value of our real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may not be recoverable if such indicators occur we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions including rental rates costs of tenant improvements leasing commissions anticipated hold period comparable sales information and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition including the exit capitalization rate these key assumptions are subjective in nature and the resulting impairment if any could differ from the actual gain or loss recognized upon ultimate sale in an arms length transaction if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the companys financial condition or operating performance in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land we generally use market data and comparable sales information 

we evaluate our investments in real estate partnerships for impairment whenever there are indicators including underlying property operating performance and general market conditions that the value of our investments in real estate partnerships may be impaired an investment in a real estate partnerships is considered impaired only if we determine that its fair value is less than the net carrying value of the investment in that real estate partnerships on an otherthantemporary basis cash flow projections for the investments consider property level factors such as expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other factors we consider various qualitative factors to determine if a decrease in the value of our investment is otherthantemporary these factors include the age of the real estate partnerships our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity and the financial condition and longterm prospects of the entity if we believe that the decline in the fair value of the investment is temporary no impairment charge is recorded if our analysis indicates that there is an otherthantemporary impairment related to the investment in a particular real estate partnership the carrying value of the investment will be adjusted to an amount that reflects the estimated fair value of the investment 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 to consolidated financial statements 

environmental matters 

we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining primarily to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers and underground petroleum storage tanks we believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations generally we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to more environmentally friendly systems where available we have applied and been accepted into statesponsored environmental programs we have a blanket environmental insurance policy for thirdparty liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination we have also placed environmental insurance where possible on specific properties with known contamination in order to mitigate our environmental risk we monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites we also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so 

as of december 31 2018  we and our investments in real estate partnerships had accrued liabilities of 87 million  for our prorata share of environmental remediation we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations however we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities that any previous owner occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants by the condition of nearby properties or by unrelated third parties or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have offbalance sheet arrangements financings or other relationships with other unconsolidated entities other than our unconsolidated investment partnerships or other persons also known as variable interest entities not previously discussed our unconsolidated investment partnership properties have been financed with nonrecourse loans we have no guarantees related to these loans 

inflationdeflation 

inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers however inflation may become a greater concern in the near future most all of our longterm leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation which require tenants to pay their prorata share of operating expenses including commonarea maintenance real estate taxes insurance and utilities thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation in addition many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years which permits us to seek increased rents upon rerental at market rates however during deflationary periods or periods of economic weakness minimum rents and percentage rents will decline as the supply of available retail space exceeds demand and consumer spending declines occupancy declines will result in lower recovery rates of our operating expenses

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to two significant components of interest rate risk 

 we continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt to repay maturing debt or fund our commitments based upon the current capital markets our current credit ratings our current capacity under our unsecured credit facilities and the number of high quality unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings we expect that we will be able to successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund these debt obligations 

our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the table below presents the principal cash flows weighted average interest rates of remaining debt and the fair value of total debt as of december 31 2018  dollars in thousands the table is presented by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes although the average interest rate for variable rate debt is included in the table those rates represent rates that existed as of december 31 2018  and are subject to change on a monthly basis in addition the company continually assesses the market risk for its floating rate debt and believes that a 1 increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 18 million per year based on 381 million of floating rate mortgage debt and 1450 million of floating rate line of credit debt outstanding at december 31 2018  if the company increases its line of credit balance in the future additional decreases to future earnings and cash flows would occur

competition 

we are among the largest owners of shopping centers in the nation based on revenues number of properties gla and market capitalization there are numerous companies and individuals engaged in the ownership development acquisition and operation of shopping centers that compete with us in our targeted markets including grocery store chains that also anchor some of our shopping centers this results in competition for attracting anchor tenants as well as the acquisition of existing shopping centers and new development sites we believe that our competitive advantages are driven by 

 employees 

our corporate headquarters are located at one independent drive suite 114 jacksonville florida we presently maintain 21 market offices nationwide including our corporate headquarters where we conduct management leasing construction and investment activities we have 446 employees throughout the united states and we believe that our relations with our employees are good 

compliance with governmental regulations 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate certain hazardous or toxic substances at our shopping centers these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances the cost of required remediation and the owners liability for remediation could exceed the value of the property andor the aggregate assets of the owner the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral although we have a number of properties that could require or are currently undergoing varying levels of environmental remediation known environmental remediation is not currently expected to have a material financial impact on us due to insurance programs designed to mitigate the cost of remediation various stateregulated programs that shift the responsibility and cost to the state and existing accrued liabilities for remediation 

executive officers 

our executive officers are appointed each year by our board of directors each of our executive officers has been employed by us for more than five years

defined terms 

we use certain nongaap performance measures in addition to the required gaap presentations as we believe these measures improve the understanding of the companys operational results we manage our entire real estate portfolio without regard to ownership structure although certain decisions impacting properties owned through partnerships require partner approval therefore we believe presenting our prorata share of certain operating metrics regardless of ownership structure along with other nongaap measures makes comparisons of other reits operating results to the companys more meaningful we continually evaluate the usefulness relevance limitations and calculation of our reported nongaap performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public and thus such reported measures could change 

the following terms as defined are commonly used by management and the investing public to understand and evaluate our operational results 

 the prorata information is prepared on a basis consistent with the comparable consolidated amounts and is intended to more accurately reflect our proportionate economic interest in the operating results of properties in our portfolio we do not control the unconsolidated investment partnerships and the prorata presentations of the assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses do not represent our legal claim to such items the partners are entitled to profit or loss allocations and distributions of cash flows according to the operating agreements which provide for such 

 3 

allocations according to their invested capital our share of invested capital establishes the ownership interests we use to prepare our prorata share 

the presentation of prorata information has limitations which include but are not limited to the following 

 because of these limitations the prorata financial information should not be considered independently or as a substitute for our financial statements as reported under gaap we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap financial statements using the prorata information as a supplement

 item 1a risk factors 

risk factors related to the retail industry 

economic and market conditions may adversely affect the retail industry and consequently reduce our revenues and cash flow and increase our operating expenses 

our properties are leased primarily to retail tenants from whom we derive most of our revenue in the form of minimum rent expense recoveries and other income therefore our performance and operating results are directly linked to the economic and market conditions occurring in the retail industry we are subject to the risks that upon expiration leases for space in our properties are not renewed by existing tenants vacant space is not leased to new tenants or demand new lease terms including costs for renovations or concessions the market for leasing retail space in our properties may be adversely affected by any of the following 

 

to the extent that any of these conditions occur they are likely to impact the retail industry our retail tenants the demand and market rents for retail space the occupancy levels of our properties our ability to sell acquire or develop properties our operating results and our cash available for distributions to stock and unit holders 

the integration of bricks and mortar stores and ecommerce by retailers and a continued shift in retail sales towards ecommerce may adversely impact our revenues and cash flows 

the recent merger of amazoncom with whole foods market inc highlights the increasing impact of ecommerce on retailers and changes in customer buying habits including curbside pickup of items ordered on line and home delivery of food kits such as blue apron and hellofresh retailers are considering these ecommerce trends when making decisions regarding their bricks and mortar stores and how they will compete and innovate in a rapidly changing ecommerce environment many retailers in our shopping centers provide services or sell goods which have historically been less likely to be purchased online however the continuing increase in ecommerce sales in all retail categories may cause retailers to adjust the size or number of retail locations in the future or close stores this shift may adversely impact our occupancy and rental rates which would impact our revenues and cash flows changes in shopping trends as a result of the growth in ecommerce may also impact the profitability of retailers that do not adapt to changes in market conditions these conditions may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows if we are unable to meet the needs of our tenants or if our tenants encounter financial difficulties as a result of changing market conditions 

our business is dependent on perceptions by retailers and shoppers of the safety convenience and attractiveness of our retail properties 

we are dependent on perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety convenience and attractiveness of our retail properties if retailers and shoppers perceive competing retail properties and other retailing options to be safer more convenient or of a higher quality our revenues may be adversely affected 

changing economic and retail market conditions in geographic areas where our properties are concentrated may reduce our revenues and cash flow   

economic conditions in markets where our properties are concentrated can greatly influence our financial performance during the year ended december 31 2017  our properties in california florida and texas accounted for 301  173  and 78  respectively of our noi from consolidated properties plus our prorata share from unconsolidated 

 5 

properties prorata basis our revenues and cash flow may be adversely affected by this geographic concentration if market conditions such as supply of or demand for retail space deteriorate more significantly in california florida or texas compared to other geographic areas 

our success depends on the success and continued presence of our “anchor” tenants 

anchor tenants anchor tenants or anchors occupying 10000 square feet or more occupy large stores in our shopping centers pay a significant portion of the total rent at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by attracting shoppers to the property    we derive significant revenues from anchor tenants such as publix  kroger  albertsonssafeway  tjx companies  and whole foods  who accounted for 31  31  29  24  and 23  respectively of our total annualized base rent on a prorata basis for the year ended december 31 2017  our net income and cash flow may be adversely affected by the loss of revenues and additional costs in the event a significant anchor tenant 

 

some anchors have the right to vacate their space and may prevent us from retenanting by continuing to comply and pay rent in accordance with their lease agreement vacated anchor space including space owned by the anchor can reduce rental revenues generated by the shopping center in other spaces because of the loss of the departed anchors customer drawing power if a significant tenant vacates a property cotenancy clauses in select centers may allow other tenants to modify or terminate their rent or lease obligations cotenancy clauses have several variants they may allow a tenant to postpone a store opening if certain other tenants fail to open their stores they may allow a tenant to close its store prior to lease expiration if another tenant closes its store prior to lease expiration or more commonly they may allow a tenant to pay reduced levels of rent until a certain number of tenants open their stores within the same shopping center 

a significant percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller shop space tenants and our net income may be adversely impacted if our smaller shop tenants are not successful 

a significant percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller shop space tenants shop space tenants occupying less than 10000 square feet shop space tenants may be more vulnerable to negative economic conditions as they have more limited resources than anchor tenants shop space tenants are facing reductions in sales as a result of an increase in competition including from ecommerce retailers certain shop space tenants are incorporating ecommerce into their business strategies and may seek to reduce their store sizes upon lease expiration as they adjust to and implement alternative distribution channels the types of shop space tenants vary from retail shops and restaurants to service providers if we are unable to attract the right type or mix of shop space tenants into our centers our revenues and cash flow may be adversely impacted 

at december 31 2017  shop space tenants represent approximately 36  of our gla leased at average base rents of 32  psf a onepercent decline in our shop space occupancy may result in a reduction to minimum rent of approximately 47 million  

we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy 

although minimum rent and recoveries from tenants are supported by longterm lease contracts tenants who file bankruptcy have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant for unpaid rent might be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold additionally we may incur significant expense to recover our claim and to release the vacated space in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and rejects its leases we may experience a significant reduction in our revenues and may not be able to collect all prepetition amounts owed by the bankrupt tenant 

risk factors related to real estate investments and operations 

we are subject to numerous laws and regulations that may adversely affect our operations or expose us to liability 

 6 

our properties are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations some of which may conflict with one another or be subject to varying judicial or regulatory interpretations these laws and regulations may include zoning laws building codes competition laws rules and agreements landlordtenant laws property tax regulations changes in real estate assessments and other laws and regulations generally applicable to business operations noncompliance with such laws and regulations and any associated litigation may expose us to liability 

our real estate assets may decline in value and be subject to impairment losses which may reduce our net income 

our real estate properties are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable we evaluate whether there are any indicators including property operating performance and general market conditions such that the value of the real estate properties including any related tangible or intangible assets or liabilities and goodwill may not be recoverable through the evaluation we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions including rental rates costs of tenant improvements leasing commissions anticipated holding periods and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition including the exit capitalization rate these key assumptions are subjective in nature and may differ materially from actual results changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the holding period of an asset or asset group which may result in an impairment loss and such loss may be material to the companys financial condition or operating performance to the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value 

the fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is determined through the use of comparable sales information and other market data if available or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the traditional discounted cash flow approach such cash flow projections take into account expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other relevant criteria and therefore are subject to management judgment changes in these factors may impact the determination of fair value in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land we generally use market data and comparable sales information 

these subjective assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment charge results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income which may be material there can be no assurance that we will not record impairment charges in the future related to our assets 

we face risks associated with development redevelopment and expansion of properties 

we actively pursue opportunities for new retail development or existing property redevelopment or expansion development and redevelopment activities require various government and other approvals for entitlements and any delay in such approvals may significantly delay this process we may not recover our investment in development or redevelopment projects for which approvals are not received we are subject to other risks associated with these activities including the following risks 

 

we face risks associated with the acquisition of properties 

our investment strategy includes investing in highquality shopping centers that are leased to marketdominant grocers categoryleading anchors specialty retailers or restaurants located in areas with high barriers to entry and above 

 7 

average household incomes and population densities the acquisition of properties andor real estate entities entails risks that include but are not limited to the following any of which may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

 

we face risks if we expand into new markets 

if opportunities arise we may acquire or develop properties in markets where we currently have no presence each of the risks applicable to acquiring or developing properties in our current markets are applicable to acquiring developing and integrating properties in new markets in addition we may not possess the same level of familiarity with the dynamics and conditions of the new markets we may enter which may adversely affect our operating results and investment returns in those markets 

we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid 

our properties including their related tangible and intangible assets represent the majority of our total consolidated assets and they are relatively illiquid as a result our ability to sell one or more of our properties including properties held in joint venture in response to changes in economic industry or other conditions may be limited the real estate market is affected by many factors such as general economic conditions availability and terms of financing interest rates and other factors including supply and demand for space that are beyond our control there may be less demand for lower quality properties that we have identified for ultimate disposition in markets with uncertain economic or retail environments and where buyers are more reliant on the availability of third party mortgage financing if we want to sell a property we can provide no assurance that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or at all or that the sales price of a property will be attractive at the relevant time or even exceed the carrying value of our investment moreover if a property is mortgaged we may not be able to obtain a release of the lien on that property without the payment of a substantial prepayment penalty which may restrict our ability to dispose of the property even though the sale might otherwise be desirable 

certain properties we own have a low tax basis which may result in a taxable gain on sale we intend to utilize 1031 exchanges to mitigate taxable income however there can be no assurance that we will identify properties that meet our investment objectives for acquisitions in the event that we do not utilize 1031 exchanges we may be required to distribute the gain proceeds to shareholders or pay income tax which may reduce our cash flow available to fund our commitments 

certain of the properties in our portfolio are subject to ground leases if we are found to be in breach of a ground lease or are unable to renew a ground lease we may be materially and adversely affected 

we have 28  properties in our portfolio that are either partially or completely on land subject to ground leases with third parties accordingly we only own a longterm leasehold or similar interest in those properties if we are found to be in breach of a ground lease we may lose our interest in the improvements and the right to operate the property that is subject to the ground lease in addition unless we can purchase a fee interest in the underlying land or extend the terms of these leases before or upon their expiration as to which no assurance can be given we will lose our interest in the improvements and the right to operate such properties the existing lease terms including renewal options were taken into consideration when making our investment decisions the purchase price and subsequent improvements are being depreciated over the shorter of the remaining life of the ground leases or the useful life of the underlying assets if we were to lose the right to operate a property due to a breach or not exercising renewal options of the ground lease we would be unable to derive income from such property which would impair the value of our investments and materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

geographic concentration of our properties makes our business vulnerable to natural disasters severe weather conditions and climate change an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the insurance coverage on our properties may subject us to loss of capital and revenue on those properties 

 8 

a significant number of our properties are located in areas that are susceptible to earthquakes tropical storms hurricanes tornadoes wildfires sealevel rise and other natural disasters as of december 31 2017  26 of the total insured value of our portfolio is located in the state of california including a number of properties in the san francisco bay and los angeles areas additionally 18 and 7 of the total insured value of our portfolio is located in the states of florida and texas respectively recent intense weather conditions may cause property insurance premiums to increase significantly in the future we recognize that the frequency and  or intensity of extreme weather events sealevel rise and other climatic changes may continue to increase and as a result our exposure to these events may increase these weather conditions may disrupt our business and the business of our tenants which may affect the ability of some tenants to pay rent and may reduce the willingness of tenants or residents to remain in or move to these affected areas therefore as a result of the geographic concentration of our properties we face risks including higher costs such as uninsured property losses and higher insurance premiums and disruptions to our business and the businesses of our tenants 

we carry comprehensive liability fire flood terrorism rental loss and environmental insurance for our properties with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties some types of losses such as losses from named wind storms earthquakes terrorism or wars may have limited coverage or be excluded from insurance coverage although we carry specific insurance coverage for named windstorm and earthquake losses the policies are subject to deductibles up to 2 to 5 of the total insured value of each property up to a 10 million maximum deductible per occurrence for each of these perils with limits of 300 million per occurrence for all perils except earthquake which has a total annual aggregate limit of 300 million terrorism coverage is limited to 200 million per occurrence related to property damage liability claims are limited to 151 million per occurrence should a loss occur at any of our properties that is subject to a substantial deductible or is in excess of the property or casualty insurance limits of our policies we may lose part or all of our invested capital and revenues from such property which may have a material adverse impact on our operating results financial condition and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders 

to the extent climate change causes adverse changes in weather patterns our properties in certain markets may experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea‑levels over time these conditions may result in volatile or decreased demand for retail space at certain of our properties or in extreme cases our inability to operate the properties at all climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of insurance on favorable terms or making insurance unavailable moreover compliance with new laws or regulations related to climate change including compliance with “green” building codes may require us to make improvements to our existing properties or increase taxes and fees assessed on us or our properties at this time there can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on us 

terrorist activities or violence occurring at our properties also may directly affect the value of our properties through damage destruction or loss insurance for such acts may be unavailable or cost more resulting in an increase to our operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations to the extent that our tenants are affected by such attacks and threats of attacks their businesses may be adversely affected including their ability to continue to meet obligations under their existing leases 

loss of our key personnel may adversely affect our business and operations 

the success of our business depends in part on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees and our ability to attract retain and motivate talented employees may significantly impact our future performance competition for these individuals is intense and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive management team and other key employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals for these positions in the future losing any one or more of these persons may have a material adverse effect on us 

we face competition from numerous sources including other reits and other real estate owners 

the ownership of shopping centers is highly fragmented we face competition from other public reits large private investors institutional investors and from numerous small owners in the acquisition ownership and leasing of shopping centers we also compete to develop shopping centers with other reits engaged in development activities as well as with local regional and national real estate developers this competition may 

 

if we cannot successfully compete in our targeted markets our cash flow and therefore distributions to stock and unit holders may be adversely affected 

 9 

costs of environmental remediation may reduce our cash flow available for distribution to stock and unit holders 

under various federal state and local laws an owner or manager of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on the property these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances the cost of any required remediation may exceed the value of the property andor the aggregate assets of the owner or the responsible party the presence of or the failure to properly remediate hazardous or toxic substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a contaminated property or to use the property as collateral for a loan we can provide no assurance that we are aware of all potential environmental liabilities that any previous owner occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us that our properties will not be affected by tenants or nearby properties or other unrelated third parties and that future uses or conditions or changes in environmental laws and regulations will not result in additional material environmental liabilities to us 

compliance with the americans with disabilities act and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures 

all of our properties are required to comply with the americans with disabilities act “ada” which generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities compliance with ada requirements may require removal of access barriers and noncompliance may result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants or both while the tenants to whom we lease space in our properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions and typically under tenant leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these tenants to cover costs may be adversely affected in addition we are required to operate the properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations as they may be adopted by governmental entities and become applicable to the properties we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with these requirements and these expenditures may have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our financial obligations and make distributions to our stock and unit holders 

we face risks associated with security breaches through cyber‑attacks cyber intrusions or otherwise as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology it networks and related systems 

we face risks associated with security breaches whether through cyber‑attacks or cyber intrusions over the internet malware computer viruses attachments to e‑mails persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems and other significant disruptions of our it networks and related systems our it networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day‑to‑day operations and in some cases may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants and coinvestment partners although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our it networks and related systems and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging even the most well protected information networks systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target and in some cases are designed not to be detected and in fact may not be detected accordingly we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk 

a breach or significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our systems including our primary website may damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers tenants and revenues generate third party claims result in the unintended andor unauthorized public disclosure or the misappropriation of proprietary personal identifying and confidential information and require us to incur significant expenses to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues and we may not be able to recover these expenses in whole or in any part from our service providers responsible parties or insurance carriers 

risk factors related to our partnerships and joint ventures 

we do not have voting control over properties owned in our coinvestment partnerships and joint ventures so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued 

we have invested substantial capital as a partner in a number of partnerships and joint ventures to acquire own lease develop or redevelop properties these activities are subject to the same risks as our investments in our whollyowned properties these investments and other future similar investments may involve risks that would not be present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or other owners might become bankrupt suffer a deterioration in their creditworthiness or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions partners or other owners may have economic or

other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our own business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives 

these investments and other future similar investments also have the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions such as a sale or financing because neither we nor our partner or other owner has full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or other owners might result in litigation or arbitration that may increase our expenses and prevent management from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or other owners might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we risk the possibility of being liable for the actions of our partners or other owners these factors may limit the return that we receive from such investments or cause our cash flows to be lower than our estimates 

the termination of our partnerships may adversely affect our cash flow operating results and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders 

if partnerships owning a significant number of properties were dissolved for any reason we would lose the asset property management leasing and construction management fees from these partnerships which may adversely affect our operating results and our cash available for distribution to stock and unit holders 

risk factors related to funding strategies and capital structure 

higher market capitalization rates and lower net operating income noi at our properties may adversely impact our ability to sell properties and fund developments and acquisitions and may dilute earnings 

as part of our funding strategy we sell operating properties that no longer meet our investment standards or those with a limited future growth profile these sales proceeds are used to fund the construction of new developments redevelopments and repay debt and acquisitions an increase in market capitalization rates or a decline in noi may cause a reduction in the value of centers identified for sale which would have an adverse impact on the amount of cash generated in order to meet the cash requirements of our development program we may be required to sell more properties than initially planned which may have a negative impact on our earnings additionally the sale of properties resulting in significant tax gains may require higher distributions to our stockholders or payment of additional income taxes in order to maintain our reit status we intend to utilize 1031 exchanges to mitigate taxable income however there can be no assurance that we will identify properties that meet our investment objectives for acquisitions 

we depend on external sources of capital which may not be available in the future on favorable terms or at all 

to qualify as a reit the parent company must among other things distribute to its stockholders each year at least 90 of its reit taxable income excluding any net capital gains because of these distribution requirements we may not be able to fund all future capital needs with income from operations we therefore will have to rely on thirdparty sources of capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all our access to thirdparty sources of capital depends on a number of things including the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings our access to debt depends on our credit rating the willingness of creditors to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets in addition to finding creditors willing to lend to us we are dependent upon our joint venture partners to contribute their pro rata share of any amount needed to repay or refinance existing debt when lenders reduce the amount of debt our partnerships and joint ventures are eligible to refinance 

in addition our existing debt arrangements also impose covenants that limit our flexibility in obtaining other financing additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders interests and additional debt financing may substantially increase our degree of leverage 

without access to external sources of capital we would be required to pay outstanding debt with our operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales our operating cash flows may not be sufficient to pay our outstanding debt as it comes due and real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly at a return we believe is appropriate if we are required to deleverage our business with operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales we may be forced to reduce the amount of or eliminate altogether our distributions to stock and unit holders or refrain from making investments in our business 

our debt financing may adversely affect our business and financial condition 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance which to a certain extent is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control in addition we do not expect to generate sufficient operating cash flow to make balloon principal payments on our debt when due if we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms we may be forced i to dispose of properties which might result in losses or ii to obtain financing at unfavorable terms either of which may reduce the cash flow available for distributions to 

 11 

stock and unit holders if we cannot make required mortgage payments the mortgagee may foreclose on the property securing the mortgage 

covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition 

our unsecured notes unsecured term loans and unsecured line of credit contain customary covenants including compliance with financial ratios such as ratio of total debt to gross asset value and fixed charge coverage ratio fixed charge coverage ratio is defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda divided by the sum of interest expense and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders if any these covenants may limit our operational flexibility and our acquisition activities moreover if we breach any of the covenants in our debt agreements and do not cure the breach within the applicable cure period our lenders may require us to repay the debt immediately even in the absence of a payment default many of our debt arrangements including our unsecured notes unsecured term loans and unsecured line of credit are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other material debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants may have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our stock 

increases in interest rates would cause our borrowing costs to rise and negatively impact our results of operations 

although a significant amount of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates we do borrow funds at variable interest rates under our credit facilities and term loans as of december 31 2017  27  of our outstanding debt was variable rate debt increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense on any variable rate debt to the extent we have not hedged our exposure to changes in interest rates in addition increases in interest rates will affect the terms under which we refinance our existing debt as it matures to the extent we have not hedged our exposure to changes in interest rates this would reduce our future earnings and cash flows which may adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also may reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our stock and unit holders 

hedging activity may expose us to risks including the risks that a counterparty will not perform and that the hedge will not yield the economic benefits we anticipate which may adversely affect us 

from time to time we manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements that involve risk such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements and that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes there can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will qualify for hedge accounting or that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations should we desire to terminate a hedging agreement there may be significant costs and cash requirements involved to fulfill our obligations under the hedging agreement failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations 

we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through taxdeferred contribution transactions which may result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell such assets 

we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in our operating partnership which may result in stockholder dilution this acquisition structure may have the effect of among other things reducing the amount of tax depreciation we may deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties and may require that we agree to protect the contributors’ ability to defer recognition of taxable gain through restrictions on our ability to dispose of the acquired properties andor the allocation of partnership debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases these restrictions may limit our ability to sell an asset at a time or on terms that would be favorable absent such restrictions 

risk factors related to our company and the market price for our securities 

as a result of our merger with equity one inc the gazit parties became significant stockholders of regency centers and may have interests that are different from our other stockholders 

mr chaim katzman and gazitglobe ltd and certain of its affiliated entities the gazit parties own less than 10 of outstanding shares of our common stock this concentration of ownership in one group of stockholders may potentially be disadvantageous to the interests of our other stockholders the gazit parties have sold some of the shares they own in regency centers since we merged and have filed a plan with the sec to continue selling shares continued sales of our shares may cause volatility in our stock price and we may find it more expensive to raise capital if needed through the sale of additional equity securities 

 12 

under the governance agreement entered into as a part of the merger with equity one we nominated mr katzman to our board of directors effective february 14 2018 mr katzman resigned from our board however so long as the gazit parties beneficially own 7 or more of our outstanding common stock the gazit parties will have the right to designate another person to be appointed to our board of directors which person must be reasonably acceptable to our board of directors 

changes in economic and market conditions may adversely affect the market price of our securities 

the market price of our debt and equity securities may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors many of which are out of our control including 

 

these factors may cause the market price of our securities to decline regardless of our financial condition results of operations business or prospects it is impossible to ensure that the market price of our securities including our common stock will not fall in the future a decrease in the market price of our common stock may reduce our ability to raise additional equity in the public markets selling common stock at a decreased market price would have a dilutive impact on existing stockholders 

there is no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates 

our ability to continue to pay dividends at historical rates or to increase our dividend rate will depend on a number of factors including among others the following 

 

if we do not maintain or periodically increase the dividend on our common stock it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and other securities 

risk factors related to laws and regulations 

if the parent company fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes it would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 

we believe that the parent company qualifies for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes and we plan to operate so that we can continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit if the parent company continues to qualify as a reit it generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders many reit requirements however are highly technical and complex the determination that the parent company is a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances some of which may not be totally within our control and some of which involve questions of interpretation for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income must come from specific passive sources like rent that are itemized in the reit tax laws there can be no assurance that the internal revenue service “irs” or a court would agree with the positions we have taken in interpreting the reit requirements we are also 

 13 

required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains the fact that we hold many of our assets through coinvestment partnerships and their subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements furthermore congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult or impossible for the parent company to remain qualified as a reit 

also unless the irs granted relief under certain statutory provisions the parent company would remain disqualified as a reit for four years following the year it first failed to qualify if the parent company failed to qualify as a reit currently andor with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired we would have to pay significant income taxes reducing cash available to pay dividends which would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to pay any dividends to stockholders although we believe that the parent company qualifies as a reit we cannot assure you that the parent company will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes 

even if the parent company qualifies as a reit for federal income tax purposes we are required to pay certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from “prohibited transactions” that income will be subject to a 100 tax in general prohibited transactions include sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business the determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale while we have undertaken a significant number of asset sales in recent years we do not believe that those sales should be considered prohibited transactions but there can be no assurance that the irs would not contend otherwise 

in addition on december 22 2017 hr 1 commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax cuts and jobs act was signed into law by the us president although we are not aware of any provision in the final tax reform legislation or any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect our ability to operate as a reit new legislation as well as new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may be introduced enacted or promulgated from time to time that may change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification in a manner that is adverse to our stockholders 

recent changes to the us tax laws may have a significant negative impact on the overall economy our tenants our investors and our business 

the tax cuts and jobs act made significant changes to the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code while the changes in the tax cuts and jobs act generally appear to be favorable with respect to reits the extensive changes to nonreit provisions in the code may have unanticipated effects on us or our stockholders moreover congressional leaders have recognized that the process of adopting extensive tax legislation in a short amount of time without hearings and substantial time for review is likely to have led to drafting errors issues needing clarification and unintended consequences that will have to be reviewed in subsequent tax legislation at this point it is not clear when congress will address these issues or when the internal revenue service will issue administrative guidance on the changes made in the tax cuts and jobs act 

as a result of the changes to us federal tax laws implemented by the tax cuts and jobs act our taxable income and the amount of distributions to our stockholders required in order to maintain our reit status and our relative tax advantage as a reit may significantly change the longterm impact of the tax cuts and jobs act on the overall economy government revenues our tenants us and the real estate industry cannot be reliably predicted at this early stage of the new law’s implementation furthermore the tax cuts and jobs act may negatively impact certain of our tenants’ operating results financial condition and future business plans the tax cuts and jobs act may also result in reduced government revenues and therefore reduced government spending which may negatively impact some of our tenants that rely on government funding there can be no assurance that the tax cuts and jobs act will not negatively impact our operating results financial condition and future business operations 

dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates 

subject to limited exceptions dividends paid by reits other than distributions designated as capital gain dividends qualified dividends or returns of capital are not eligible for reduced rates for qualified dividends paid by c corporations and are taxable at ordinary income tax rates the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends may cause investors who are individuals trusts and estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which may adversely affect the value of the shares of reits including the shares of our capital stock 

under the recently passed tax cuts and jobs act the rate brackets for noncorporate taxpayer’s ordinary income are adjusted the top tax rate is reduced from 396 to 37 excluding the 38 medicare tax on net investment income and 

 14 

ordinary reit dividends are taxed at even lower effective rates under the tax cuts and jobs act for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2026 distributions from reits that are treated as dividends but are not designated as qualified dividends or capital gain dividends are generally taxed as ordinary income after deducting 20 of the amount of the dividend in the case of noncorporate stockholders at the maximum ordinary income tax rate of 37 applicable for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2026 the maximum tax rate on ordinary reit dividends for noncorporate stockholders is generally 296 plus the 38 medicare tax on net investment income 

foreign stockholders may be subject to us federal income tax on gain recognized on a disposition of our common stock if we do not qualify as a domestically controlled reit 

a foreign person disposing of a us real property interest including shares of a us corporation whose assets consist principally of us real property interests is generally subject to us federal income tax on any gain recognized on the disposition this tax does not apply however to the disposition of stock in a reit if the reit is domestically controlled in general we will be a domestically controlled reit if at all times during the fiveyear period ending on the applicable stockholder’s disposition of our stock less than 50 in value of our stock was held directly or indirectly by nonus persons if we were to fail to qualify as a domestically controlled reit gain recognized by a foreign stockholder on a disposition of our common stock would be subject to us federal income tax unless our common stock was traded on an established securities market and the foreign stockholder did not at any time during a specified testing period directly or indirectly own more than 10 of our outstanding common stock 

legislative or other actions affecting reits may have a negative effect on us 

the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us department of the treasury changes to the tax laws with or without retroactive application may adversely affect regency or our investors we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect regency or our investors new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us also the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities or an investment in other entities may change making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit 

complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities 

the reit provisions of the code limit our ability to hedge our liabilities generally income from a hedging transaction that constitutes “qualifying income” for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests applicable to reits does not constitute “gross income” for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests provided that we properly identify the hedging transaction pursuant to the applicable sections of the code and treasury regulations to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions or fail to make the proper tax identifications the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests as a result of these rules we may need to limit our use of otherwise advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a taxable reit subsidiary or trs 

changes in accounting standards may impact our financial results 

the financial accounting standards board fasb in conjunction with the sec has several key projects recently completed or on their agenda that may impact how we currently account for our material transactions including lease accounting and other convergence projects with the international accounting standards board the largest projects revenue from contracts with customers and leases have been issued and will be adopted by the company by their effective dates as further described in note 1 the leases standard is expected to have an impact on our financial statements when adopted to require all of our operating leases for office ground and equipment leases to be recorded on our balance sheet also we will no longer capitalize internal leasing compensation costs and legal costs associated with leasing activities under the new standard which will result in an increase in our general and administrative costs and a reduction to our net income 

restrictions on the ownership of the parent companys capital stock to preserve its reit status may delay or prevent a change in control 

ownership of more than 7 by value of our outstanding capital stock is prohibited with certain exceptions by the parent companys articles of incorporation for the purpose of maintaining its qualification as a reit this 7 limitation may discourage a change in control and may also i deter tender offers for our capital stock which offers may be attractive to our stockholders or ii limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their capital stock that might otherwise exist if an investor attempted to assemble a block in excess of 7 of our outstanding capital stock or to affect a change in control 

 15 

the issuance of the parent companys capital stock may delay or prevent a change in control 

the parent companys articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to 30000000 shares of preferred stock and 10000000 shares of special common stock and to establish the preferences and rights of any shares issued the issuance of preferred stock or special common stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control the provisions of the florida business corporation act regarding affiliated transactions may also deter potential acquisitions by preventing the acquiring party from consummating a merger or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of our disinterested stockholders

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executing on our strategy 

during the year ended 2017  we completed the merger with equity one on march 1 2017 and acquired 121 properties representing 160 million sf of gla for 52 billion further enhancing the quality of our operating portfolio of retail shopping centers the consolidated net assets and results of operations of equity one are included in the consolidated financial statements from the closing date march 1 2017 

we had net income attributable to common stockholders of 1599 million  net of 807 million of merger costs as compared to 1439 million  of net income attributable to common stockholders during the year ended december 31 2016  

we sustained superior same property noi growth compared to the average of our shopping center peers 

 we developed and redeveloped high quality shopping centers at attractive returns on investment 

 we maintained a conservative balance sheet providing financial flexibility to cost effectively fund investment opportunities and debt maturities 

 

leasing activity and significant tenants 

we believe our highquality grocery anchored shopping centers located in densely populated desirable infill trade areas create attractive spaces for retail tenants 

prorata occupancy 

the following table summarizes prorata occupancy rates of our combined consolidated and unconsolidated shopping center portfolio 

 41 



the decline in shop space percent leased is due to the merger with equity one which had lower shop space occupancy than regency 

prorata leasing activity 

the following table summarizes leasing activity including our prorata share of activity within the portfolio of our coinvestment partnerships 





total average prorata base rent on signed shop space leases during 2017  was 3168  psf and approximates the prorata average annual base rent of all shop space leases due to expire during the next twelve months of 3172 psf 

 42 

significant tenants and concentrations of risk 

we seek to reduce our operating and leasing risks through geographic diversification and by avoiding dependence on any single property market or tenant the following table summarizes our most significant tenants based on their percentage of annualized base rent 



bankruptcies and credit concerns 

our management team devotes significant time to researching and monitoring retail trends consumer preferences customer shopping behaviors changes in retail delivery methods and changing demographics in order to anticipate the challenges and opportunities impacting the retail industry a greater shift to ecommerce largescale retail business failures unemployment and tight credit markets could negatively impact consumer spending and have an adverse effect on our results of operations we seek to mitigate these potential impacts through tenant diversification retenanting weaker tenants with stronger operators anchoring our centers with market leading grocery stores that drive foot traffic and maintaining a presence in affluent suburbs and dense infill trade areas as a result of our research and findings we may reduce new leasing suspend leasing or curtail allowances for construction of leasehold improvements within a certain retail category or to a specific retailer in order to reduce our risk from bankruptcies and store closings 

we closely monitor the operating performance and rent collections of tenants in our shopping centers as well as those retailers experiencing significant changes to their business models as a result of reduced customer traffic in their stores and increased competition from ecommerce sales retailers who are unable to withstand these and other business pressures may file for bankruptcy although base rent is supported by longterm lease contracts tenants who file bankruptcy generally have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant for unpaid rent might be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold additionally we may incur significant expense to recover our claim and to release the vacated space in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues tenants who have filed for bankruptcy and continue to occupy space in our shopping centers represent an aggregate of 03 of our annual base rent on a prorata basis 

 43 

results from operations 

comparison of the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  

results from operations for the twelve months ended   december 31 2017  reflect the results of our merger with equity one on march 1 2017 

our total revenues increased as summarized in the following table 



minimum rent changed as follows 

 percentage rent increased 25 million  primarily as a result of properties acquired through the equity one merger 

recoveries from tenants represent reimbursements to us for tenants prorata share of the operating maintenance and real estate tax expenses that we incur to operate our shopping centers recoveries from tenants increased as follows 

 other income which consists of incidental income earned at our centers increased 38 million  as follows 



 44 

changes in our operating expenses are summarized in the following table 



depreciation and amortization costs changed as follows 

 operating and maintenance costs changed as follows 

 general and administrative changed increased as follows 

 real estate taxes changed as follows 

 other operating expenses increased as follows 



 45 

the following table presents the components of other expense income 



the 419 million  net increase in total interest expense is due to 

 we did not recognize any impairments during 2017  during 2016 we recognized 42 million  of impairment losses on two operating properties and two land parcels all of which have since been sold 

during 2017  we repaid nine mortgages with a portion of the proceeds from our unsecured public debt offering in june 2017 and recognized 124 million of debt extinguishment costs in 2016 we recognized a 142 million charge in connection with the early redemption of the 300 million unsecured notes 

net investment income increased 23 million  driven by realized and unrealized gains on investments held within the nonqualified deferred compensation plan 

during 2016 we recognized a 406 million charge to settle 220 million of forward starting interest rate swaps related to new debt previously expected to be issued in 2017 

 46 

our equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships decreased as follows 



the 132 million  decrease in our total equity in income in investments in real estate partnerships is largely attributed to 

 the following represents the remaining components that comprise net income attributable to the common stockholders and unit holders 



the 97 million  income tax benefit during 2017  was primarily due to revaluing the net deferred tax liability at a trs entity acquired through the equity one merger as a result of the change in corporate tax rates from the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act 

during 2017  we sold six  operating properties and nine  land parcels resulting in gains of 274 million  compared to gains of 473 million  from the sale of eleven  operating properties and sixteen  land parcels during 2016 

during 2017  we redeemed both our series 6 and series 7 preferred stock resulting in a decrease to preferred stock dividends offset by a charge upon writing off issuance costs

 other operating expenses increased 62 million primarily due to costs incurred from 2016 acquisition activities including costs associated with the merger with equity one inc 

the following table presents the components of other expense income 



the 119 million decrease in total interest expense is due to 

 during 2016 we recognized 42 million of impairment losses on two operating properties and two land parcels all of which have since been sold we did not recognize any impairments during 2015 

we redeemed all of our outstanding 400 million notes in two tranches occurring in 2016 and 2015 during 2016 we recognized a 142 million charge when redeeming the 300 million notes during 2015 we early redeemed 100 million of those same notes which included an 82 million makewhole premium charge 

net investment income increased 10 million driven by realized and unrealized gains on investments held within the nonqualified deferred compensation plan during 2016 

 49 

we recognized a 406 million charge to settle 220 million of forward starting interest rate swaps related to new debt previously expected to be issued in 2017 as a result of our july 2016 equity offering and the early redemption of the 300 million notes in august 2016 the company believed that the issuance of new fixed rate debt within the remaining period of the forward starting swaps was probable to no longer occur accordingly we ceased hedge accounting and reclassified the 406 million paid to settle the forward starting swaps from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings 

our equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships increased as follows 



the 340 million increase in our equity in income in investments in real estate partnerships is largely attributed to i our share of gains on the sale of real estate within our grir columbia i columbia ii and other investments in real estate partnerships ii interest expense savings within grir resulting from decreased debt balances and refinancing activity at lower interest rates and iii and a decrease in depreciation expense within grir from fully depreciated land improvement assets 

the following represents the remaining components that comprise net income attributable to the common stockholders and unit holders 



during 2016 we sold 11 operating properties and 16 land parcels resulting in gains of 473 million compared to gains of 356 million from the sale of five operating properties and two land parcels during 2015

supplemental earnings information 

we use certain nongaap performance measures in addition to certain performance metrics determined under gaap as we believe these measures improve the understanding of the companys operating results we manage our entire real estate portfolio without regard to ownership structure although certain decisions impacting properties owned through partnerships require partner approval therefore we believe presenting our prorata share of operating results regardless of ownership structure along with other nongaap measures may assist in comparing the companys operating results to other reits we continually evaluate the usefulness relevance limitations and calculation of our reported nongaap performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public and thus such reported measures could change see defined terms in part i item 1 

prorata same property noi 

for purposes of evaluating same property noi on a comparative basis and in light of the merger with equity one on march 1 2017 we are presenting our same property noi on a pro forma basis as if the merger had occurred january 1 2016 this perspective allows us to evaluate same property noi growth over a comparable period the pro forma same property noi as adjusted is not necessarily indicative of what the actual same property noi and growth would have been if the merger had occurred on january 1 2016 nor does it purport to represent the same property noi and growth for future periods 

our prorata same property noi as adjusted excluding termination fees changed from the following major components 



base rent increased 266 million  driven by increases in rental rate growth on new and renewal leases contractual rent steps and rent commencement at redevelopments 

percentage rent decreased 19 million  as a result of lease negotiations to shift percentage rent into base rent upon renewal coupled with decline in performance at certain historically larger percentage rent paying tenants 

recovery revenue increased 108 million  as a result of increases in recoverable costs as noted below and improvements in recovery rates 

other income decreased 10 million  due to a reduction in lease termination and other fee income 

operating expenses increased 92 million  primarily due to higher real estate taxes from increases in assessed values

liquidity and capital resources 

general 

we use cash flows generated from operating investing and financing activities to strengthen our balance sheet finance our development and redevelopment projects fund our investment activities and maintain financial flexibility we continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt or equity to repay maturing debt or fund our capital commitments 

except for the 500 million of unsecured public and private placement debt assumed with the equity one merger on march 1 2017 our parent company has no capital commitments other than its guarantees of the commitments of our operating partnership all remaining debt is held by our operating partnership or by our coinvestment partnerships the operating partnership is a coissuer and a guarantor on the 500 million of outstanding debt of our parent company assumed in the equity one merger the parent company will from time to time access the capital markets for the purpose of issuing new equity and will simultaneously contribute all of the offering proceeds to the operating partnership in exchange for additional partnership units based upon our available sources of capital our current credit ratings and the number of high quality unencumbered properties we own we believe our available capital resources are sufficient to meet our expected capital needs 

in addition to its 454 million  of cash the company has the following additional sources of capital available 



we operate our business such that we expect net cash flow from operating activities will provide the necessary funds to pay our distributions to our common and preferred stock and unit holders which were 3283 million  and 2224 million  for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively we currently do not have any preferred shares issued and outstanding our dividend distribution policy is set by our board of directors who monitors our financial position our board of directors recently declared a common stock dividend of 0555  per share payable on march 2 2018  to shareholders of record as of february 20 2018 future dividends will be declared at the discretion of our board of directors and will be subject to capital requirements and availability we plan to continue paying an aggregate amount of distributions to our stock and unit holders that at a minimum meet the requirements to continue qualifying as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

during the next twelve months we estimate that we will require approximately 2564 million of cash including 2380 million to complete inprocess developments and redevelopments 64 million to repay maturing debt and 120 million to fund our prorata share of estimated capital contributions to our coinvestment partnerships for repayment of maturing debt if we start new developments redevelop additional shopping centers commit to new acquisitions prepay debt prior to maturity or repurchase shares of our common stock our cash requirements will increase if we refinance maturing debt our cash requirements will decrease to meet our cash requirements we will utilize cash generated from operations proceeds from the sale of real estate available borrowings from our line and when the capital markets are favorable proceeds from the sale of equity or the issuance of new longterm debt in addition we are under contract to purchase through november 2019 up to 100 ownership interest in an operating shopping center valued at 2050 million we are currently expecting to be able to purchase a 30 ownership interest in the property by november 2019 

we endeavor to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets as of december 31 2017  857 of our whollyowned real estate assets were unencumbered such assets allow us to access the secured and unsecured debt markets and to maintain availability on the line our annualized coverage ratio including our prorata share of our partnerships was 41 and 33 times for for the periods ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively we define our coverage ratio as earnings before 

 54 

interest taxes investment transaction profits net of deal costs depreciation and amortization “ ebitda” divided by the sum of the gross interest and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders 

our line term loans and unsecured loans require that we remain in compliance with various covenants which are described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements we are in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2017  and expect to remain in compliance

critical accounting estimates 

knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial statements the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities as of a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period these accounting estimates are based upon but not limited to our judgments about historical and expected future results current market conditions and interpretation of industry accounting standards they are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness however the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates 

accounts receivable and straight line rent 

minimum rent percentage rent and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs insurance and real estate taxes are the companys principal source of revenue as a result of generating this revenue we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants we are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that may affect the collection of outstanding receivables to address the collectability of these receivables we analyze historical tenant collection rates writeoff experience tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts and straight line rent reserve although we estimate uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income actual experience may differ from those estimates 

real estate investments 

acquisition of real estate investments 

upon acquisition of real estate operating properties the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land building building improvements and tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and belowmarket leases and inplace leases assumed debt and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date based on these estimates the company allocates the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities any excess consideration above the fair value allocated to the applicable assets and liabilities results in goodwill fair value is determined based on an exit price approach which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the company expenses transaction costs associated with business combinations in the period incurred and capitalizes costs associated with asset acquisitions 

we strategically coinvest with partners to own manage acquire develop and redevelop operating properties we analyze our investments in real estate partnerships in order to determine whether the entity should be consolidated if it is determined that these investments do not require consolidation because the entities are not variable interest entities “vies” we are not considered the primary beneficiary of the entities determined to be vies we do not have voting control andor the limited partners or nonmanaging members have substantive kickout or participation rights then the selection of the accounting method used to account for our investments in real estate partnerships is generally determined by our voting interests and the degree of influence we have over the entity management uses its judgment when making these determinations we use the equity method of accounting for investments in real estate partnerships when we have significant influence but do not have a controlling financial interest under the equity method we record our investments in and advances to these entities as investments in real estate partnerships in our consolidated balance sheets and our proportionate share of earnings or losses earned by the joint venture is recognized in equity in income loss of investments in real estate partnerships in our consolidated statements of operations 

development of real estate assets and cost capitalization 

we capitalize the acquisition of land the construction of buildings and other specifically identifiable development costs incurred by recording them in properties in development in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets other specifically identifiable development costs include predevelopment costs essential to the development process as well as interest real estate taxes and direct employee costs incurred during the development period once a development property is substantially complete and held available for occupancy these indirect costs are no longer capitalized 



 61 

 valuation of real estate investments 

in accordance with gaap we evaluate our real estate for impairment whenever there are indicators including property operating performance and general market conditions that the carrying value of our real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may not be recoverable if such indicators occur we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions including rental rates costs of tenant improvements leasing commissions anticipated hold period comparable sales information and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition including the exit capitalization rate these key assumptions are subjective in nature and the resulting impairment if any could differ from the actual gain or loss recognized upon ultimate sale in an arms length transaction if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the companys financial condition or operating performance in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land we generally use market data and comparable sales information 

we evaluate our investments in real estate partnerships for impairment whenever there are indicators including underlying property operating performance and general market conditions that the value of our investments in real estate partnerships may be impaired an investment in a real estate partnerships is considered impaired only if we determine that its fair value is less than the net carrying value of the investment in that real estate partnerships on an otherthantemporary basis cash flow projections for the investments consider property level factors such as expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other factors we consider various qualitative factors to determine if a decrease in the value of our investment is otherthantemporary these factors include the age of the real estate partnerships our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity the financial condition and longterm prospects of the entity and relationships with our partners and banks if we believe that the decline in the fair value of the investment is temporary no impairment charge is recorded if our analysis indicates that there is an otherthantemporary impairment related to the investment in a particular real estate partnership the carrying value of the investment will be adjusted to an amount that reflects the estimated fair value of the investment 

derivative instruments 

the company utilizes financial derivative instruments to manage risks associated with changing interest rates specifically the company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or future payment of known and uncertain cash amounts the amount of which are determined by interest rates the companys derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount timing and duration of the companys known or expected cash payments principally related to the companys borrowings for additional information on the company’s use and accounting for derivatives see notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

the company assesses effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at inception and on an ongoing basis the effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and our consolidated statement of equity our cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not perfectly match such as notional amounts settlement dates reset dates calculation period and libor rate if a cash flow 

 62 

hedge is deemed ineffective the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected 

the fair value of the companys interest rate derivatives is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including expected discounted cash flows of each derivative this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives including the period to maturity and uses observable marketbased inputs including interest rate curves and implied volatilities the company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterpartys nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 to consolidated financial statements 

environmental matters 

we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining primarily to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers and underground petroleum storage tanks we believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations generally we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to more environmentally friendly systems where available we have applied and been accepted into statesponsored environmental programs we have a blanket environmental insurance policy for thirdparty liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination we have also placed environmental insurance where possible on specific properties with known contamination in order to mitigate our environmental risk we monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites we also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so 

as of december 31 2017  we and our investments in real estate partnerships had accrued liabilities of 99 million  for our prorata share of environmental remediation we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations however we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities that any previous owner occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants by the condition of nearby properties or by unrelated third parties or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have offbalance sheet arrangements financings or other relationships with other unconsolidated entities other than our unconsolidated investment partnerships or other persons also known as variable interest entities not previously discussed our unconsolidated investment partnership properties have been financed with nonrecourse loans we have no guarantees related to these loans 

inflationdeflation 

inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers however inflation may become a greater concern in the near future most all of our longterm leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation which require tenants to pay their prorata share of operating expenses including commonarea maintenance real estate taxes insurance and utilities thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation in addition many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years which permits us to seek increased rents upon rerental at market rates however during deflationary periods or periods of economic weakness minimum rents and percentage rents will decline as the supply of available retail space exceeds demand and consumer spending declines occupancy declines will result in lower recovery rates of our operating expenses 

 63 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to two significant components of interest rate risk 

 we continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt to repay maturing debt or fund our commitments based upon the current capital markets our current credit ratings our current capacity under our unsecured credit facilities and the number of high quality unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings we expect that we will be able to successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund these debt obligations 

our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the table below presents the principal cash flows weighted average interest rates of remaining debt and the fair value of total debt as of december 31 2017  dollars in thousands the table is presented by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes although the average interest rate for variable rate debt is included in the table those rates represent rates that existed as of december 31 2017  and are subject to change on a monthly basis in addition the company continually assesses the market risk for its floating rate debt and believes that a 1 increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 10 million per year based on 363 million of floating rate mortgage debt and 600 million of floating rate line of credit debt outstanding at december 31 2017  if the company increases its line of credit balance in the future additional decreases to future earnings and cash flows would occur 

further the table below incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2017  and does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date since firm commitments are not presented the table has limited predictive value as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at that time and actual interest rates

competition 

  

we are amongst the largest owners of shopping centers in the nation based on revenues number of properties gla and market capitalization there are numerous companies and individuals engaged in the ownership development acquisition and operation of shopping centers that compete with us in our targeted markets including grocery store chains that also anchor some of our shopping centers this results in competition for attracting anchor tenants as well as the acquisition of existing shopping centers and new development sites we believe that our competitive advantages are driven by 

   

employees 

  

our corporate headquarters are located at one independent drive suite 114 jacksonville florida we presently maintain 18 market offices nationwide including our corporate headquarters where we conduct management leasing construction and investment activities we have 371 employees and we believe that our relations with our employees are good 

compliance with governmental regulations 

  

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate certain hazardous or toxic substances at our shopping centers these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances the cost of required remediation and the owners liability for remediation could exceed the value of the property andor the aggregate assets of the owner the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral although we have a number of properties that could require or are currently undergoing varying levels of environmental remediation known environmental remediation is not currently expected to have a material financial impact on us due to insurance programs designed to mitigate the cost of remediation various stateregulated programs that shift the responsibility and cost to the state and existing accrued liabilities for remediation

defined terms 

  

we use certain nongaap performance measures in addition to the required gaap presentations as we believe these measures improve the understanding of the companys operational results we manage our entire real estate portfolio without regard to ownership structure although certain decisions impacting properties owned through partnerships require partner approval therefore we believe presenting our prorata share of certain operating metrics regardless of ownership structure along with other nongaap measures makes comparisons of other reits operating results to the companys more meaningful we continually evaluate the usefulness relevance limitations and calculation of our reported nongaap performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public and thus such reported measures could change 

the following terms as defined are commonly used by management and the investing public to understand and evaluate our operational results 

 

 

 

 

 

the prorata information is prepared on a basis consistent with the comparable consolidated amounts and is intended to more accurately reflect our proportionate economic interest in the operating results of properties in our portfolio we do not control the unconsolidated investment partnerships and the prorata presentations of the assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses do not represent our legal claim to such items the partners are entitled to profit or loss allocations and distributions of cash flows according to the operating agreements which provide for such allocations according to their invested capital our share of invested capital establishes the ownership interests we use to prepare our prorata share 

the presentation of prorata information has limitations which include but are not limited to the following 

 

 

because of these limitations the prorata financial information should not be considered independently or as a substitute for our financial statements as reported under gaap we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap financial statements using the prorata information as a supplement

 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to the merger 

the merger may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated or at all 

although regency centers stockholders and equity ones stockholders approved the merger in separate stockholder meetings on february 24 2017 the completion of the merger is subject to certain conditions including 1 approval for listing on the nyse of the common stock of regency centers to be issued in connection with the merger 2 the registration statement for our shares being issued pursuant to the merger not being the subject of any stop order or proceeding seeking a stop order 3 no injunction or law prohibiting the merger 4 accuracy of each party’s representations subject in most cases to materiality or material adverse effect qualifications 5 material compliance with each party’s covenants and 6 receipt by each of equity one and regency centers of an opinion to the effect that the merger will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of section 368a of the code and of an opinion that each of equity one and regency centers qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code neither equity one nor regency centers can provide assurances that the merger will be consummated on the terms or timeline currently contemplated or at all 

the exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted in the event of any change in either our or equity one’s stock prices 

at the effective time of the merger each share of equity one common stock other than any shares owned directly by regency centers or equity one and in each case not held on behalf of third parties outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be converted into the right to receive 045 of a newly issued share of our common stock with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares the exchange ratio is fixed in the merger agreement and will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of either our common stock or equity one common stock changes in the price of our common stock prior to the merger will affect the market value of the merger consideration that equity one stockholders will receive on the closing of the merger stock price changes may result from a variety of factors many of which are beyond the control of regency centers and equity one including the following factors 

 changes in market assessments of the business operations financial position and prospects of either company 

 

our stockholders may be diluted by the merger 

the merger may dilute the ownership position of our stockholders upon completion of the merger our legacy stockholders will own approximately 62 of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock and legacy equity one stockholders will own approximately 38 of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock consequently our stockholders may have less influence over our management and policies after the effective time of the merger than they currently exercise over our management and policies 

failure to complete the merger could adversely affect our stock price and our future business and financial results  

if the merger is not completed our ongoing businesses may be adversely affected and we will be subject to numerous risks including the following 

 

 7 

if the merger is not completed we cannot assure our stockholders that these risks will not materialize or will not materially affect the business financial results and our stock prices 

the merger agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquirer of regency centers or could result in any competing proposal being at a lower price than it might otherwise be 

the merger agreement contains provisions that subject to limited exceptions restrict the ability of each of regency centers and equity one to initiate solicit propose knowingly encourage or facilitate competing thirdparty proposals to effect among other things a merger reorganization share exchange consolidation or the sale of 15 or more of the stock or consolidated net revenues net income or total assets of regency centers or equity one in addition either regency centers or equity one generally has an opportunity to offer to modify the terms of the merger agreement in response to certain competing superior proposals that may be made to the other party before the boards of directors of regency centers or equity one as the case may be may withdraw or modify its recommendation in response to such superior proposal or terminate the merger agreement to enter into such superior proposal in some circumstances one of the parties will be required to pay a substantial termination fee to the other party 

these provisions could discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of regency centers from considering or proposing such an acquisition even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than that market value proposed to be received or realized in the merger or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower price than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances under the merger agreement 

the pendency of the merger could adversely affect the business and operations of regency centers and equity one 

in connection with the pending merger some of our and equity one’s tenants or vendors may delay or defer decisions which could adversely affect the revenues earnings funds from operations cash flows and expenses of regency centers and equity one regardless of whether the merger is completed similarly current and prospective employees of regency centers and equity one may experience uncertainty about their future roles with regency centers following the merger which may materially adversely affect our and equity one’s ability to attract and retain key personnel during the pendency of the merger in addition due to interim operating covenants in the merger agreement we and equity one may be unable without the other party’s prior written consent during the pendency of the merger to pursue strategic transactions undertake significant capital projects undertake certain significant financing transactions and otherwise pursue other actions even if such actions would prove beneficial 

risks relating to regency centers after completion of the merger 

we expect to incur substantial expenses related to the merger 

we expect to incur substantial expenses in completing the merger and integrating the business operations networks systems technologies policies and procedures of regency centers and equity one there are a large number of processes that must be integrated in the merger including leasing billing management information purchasing accounting and finance sales payroll and benefits fixed asset lease administration and regulatory compliance while we and equity one have assumed that a certain level of transaction and integration expenses would be incurred there are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of integration expenses 

following the merger we may be unable to integrate the business of equity one successfully or realize the anticipated synergies and related benefits of the merger or do so within the anticipated time frame 

the merger involves the combination of two companies which currently operate as independent public companies we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of equity one potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include the following 



 8 

 

for all these reasons you should be aware that it is possible that the integration process could result in the distraction of our management the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in our services standards controls procedures and policies any of which could adversely affect the ability of regency centers to maintain relationships with tenants vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger or could otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results 

following the merger we may be unable to retain key employees 

our success after the merger will depend in part upon our ability to retain key regency and equity one employees key employees may depart either before or after the merger because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with regency centers following the merger accordingly no assurance can be given that we will be able to retain key employees to the same extent as in the past 

our future operating results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our operations following the merger 

following the merger we may continue to expand our operations through additional acquisitions development opportunities and other strategic transactions some of which involve complex challenges our future success will depend in part upon our ability to manage our expansion opportunities which may pose substantial challenges for regency centers to integrate new operations into our existing business in an efficient and timely manner and to successfully monitor our operations costs regulatory compliance and service quality and to maintain other necessary internal controls we cannot assure you that our expansion or acquisition opportunities will be successful or that we will realize our expected operating efficiencies cost savings revenue enhancements synergies or other benefits 

the trading price of shares of our common stock following the merger may be affected by factors different from those affecting the price of shares of our common stock before the merger 

if the merger is completed legacy regency stockholders will become holders of approximately 62 of the outstanding shares of our common stock and legacy equity one stockholders will become holders of approximately 38 of the outstanding shares of equity one common stock the results of our operations and the trading price of our common stock after the merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting our results of operations and the trading prices of our common stock for example some institutional investors which currently own both equity one and our common stock may elect to decrease their ownership in the merged company by selling our common stock accordingly the historical trading prices and financial results of regency centers and equity one may not be indicative of these matters for regency centers after the merger 

following the merger we will have a substantial amount of indebtedness and may need to incur more in the future 

we have substantial indebtedness and in connection with the merger will incur additional indebtedness the incurrence of new indebtedness could have adverse consequences on our business following the merger such as 



 9 

 

the impact of any of these potential adverse consequences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

at the effective time of the merger the gazit parties will become significant stockholders of regency centers and may have interests that are different from or are in addition to regency centers or our other stockholders in the future 

at the effective time of the merger mr chaim katzman and gazitglobe ltd and certain of its affiliated entities the gazit parties will own approximately 13 of outstanding shares of our common stock based on their ownership of approximately 34 of the equity one common stock as of november 14 2016 this concentration of ownership in one group of stockholders could potentially be disadvantageous to the interests of our other stockholders for example if the gazit parties were to sell or otherwise transfer all or a large percentage of their holdings our stock price could decline and we could find it more expensive to raise capital if needed through the sale of additional equity securities 

under the governance agreement we are required to nominate mr katzman to our board of directors and solicit votes for his election for so long as the gazit parties beneficially own 7 or more of our common stock outstanding as of immediately after the effective time of the merger the governance agreement also provides that in the event of mr katzman’s death disability resignation or removal or failure of mr katzman to be reelected the gazit parties will have the right to designate another person to be appointed to our board of directors which person must be reasonably acceptable to our board of directors 

the gazit parties have interests that may be different from or in addition to the interests of our other stockholders in material respects for example the gazit parties may have an interest in directly or indirectly pursuing acquisitions divestitures financings or other transactions that in their judgment could enhance their other equity investments even though such transactions might involve risks to regency centers the gazit parties may from time to time in the future acquire interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with our business they may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to regency centers for more information see “agreements with the gazit partiesgovernance agreement” 

counterparties to certain agreements with regency centers or equity one may exercise contractual rights under such agreements in connection with the merger 

we and equity one are each party to certain agreements that give the counterparty certain rights following a “change in control” including in some cases the right to terminate such agreements under some such agreements for example certain debt obligations the merger may constitute a change in control and therefore the counterparty may exercise certain rights under the agreement upon the closing of the merger any such counterparty may request modifications of its respective agreements as a condition to granting a waiver or consent under its agreement there is no assurance that such counterparties will not exercise their rights under the agreements including termination rights where available that the exercise of any such rights will not result in a material adverse effect or that any modifications of such agreements will not result in a material adverse effect 

risk factors related to our industry and real estate investments 

a shift in retail shopping from brick and mortar stores to ecommerce may have an adverse impact on our revenues and cash flow 

many retailers operating brick and mortar stores have made ecommerce sales a vital piece of their business although many of the retailers in our shopping centers either provide services or sell groceries such that their customer base does not have a tendency toward online shopping the shift to ecommerce sales may adversely impact our retail tenants sales causing those retailers to adjust the size or number of retail locations in the future this shift could adversely impact our occupancy and rental rates which would impact our revenues and cash flows 

downturns in the retail industry likely will have a direct adverse impact on our revenues and cash flow 

our properties consist primarily of groceryanchored shopping centers our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space the market for retail space could be adversely affected by any of the following 



 10 

 

to the extent that any of these conditions occur they are likely to impact market rents for retail space occupancy in the operating portfolio our ability to sell acquire or develop properties and our cash available for distributions to stock and unit holders 

our revenues and cash flow could be adversely affected if economic or market conditions deteriorate where our properties are geographically concentrated which may impede our ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses and maintain our properties 

the economic conditions in markets in which our properties are concentrated greatly influence our financial performance during the year ended december 31 2016  our properties in california  florida  and texas  accounted for 310  121  and 103  respectively of our net operating income from consolidated properties plus our prorata share from unconsolidated properties prorata basis our revenues and cash available to pay expenses maintain our properties and for distributions to stock and unit holders could be adversely affected by this geographic concentration if market conditions such as supply of or demand for retail space deteriorate in california  florida  or texas  relative to other geographic areas 

our success depends on the success and continued presence of our “anchor” tenants 

anchor tenants those occupying 10000 square feet or more occupy large amounts of square footage pay a significant portion of the total rents at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by drawing significant numbers of customers to a property     we derive significant revenues from anchor tenants such as kroger  publix  and albertsonssafeway  who accounted for 47  31  and 27  respectively of our total annualized base rent on a prorata basis for the year ended december 31 2016  our net income could be adversely affected by the loss of revenues in the event a significant tenant 

 

some anchors have the right to vacate and prevent retenanting by paying rent for the balance of the lease term vacated anchor space including space owned by the anchor can reduce rental revenues generated by the shopping center because of the loss of the departed anchor tenants customer drawing power if a significant tenant vacates a property cotenancy clauses in select centers may allow other tenants to modify or terminate their rent or lease obligations cotenancy clauses have several variants they may allow a tenant to postpone a store opening if certain other tenants fail to open their stores they may allow a tenant to close its store prior to lease expiration if another tenant closes its store prior to lease expiration or more commonly they may allow a tenant to pay reduced levels of rent until a certain number of tenants open their stores within the same shopping center 

 11 

a significant percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller shop tenants and our net income could be adversely impacted if our smaller shop tenants are not successful 

a significant percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller shop tenants those occupying less than 10000 square feet smaller shop tenants may be more vulnerable to negative economic conditions as they have more limited resources than larger tenants such tenants continue to face increasing competition from nonstore retailers and growing ecommerce in addition some of these retailers may seek to reduce their store sizes as they increasingly rely on alternative distribution channels including ecommerce and adjust their square footage needs accordingly the types of smaller shop tenants vary from retail shops to service providers if we are unable to attract the right type or mix of smaller shop tenants into our centers our net income could be adversely impacted 

at december 31 2016  shop space represents approximately 38  of our gla and is leased at average base rents of 31  psf a onepercent decline in our shop space occupancy could result in a reduction to minimum rent of approximately 86 million  

we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy 

although minimum rent is supported by longterm lease contracts tenants who file bankruptcy have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and rejects its leases we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues and may not be able to collect all prepetition amounts owed by that party 

our real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges 

our longlived assets primarily real estate held for investment are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable we evaluate whether there are any indicators including property operating performance and general market conditions such that the value of the real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may not be recoverable through the evaluation we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions including rental rates costs of tenant improvements leasing commissions anticipated holding periods and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition including the exit capitalization rate these key assumptions are subjective in nature and could differ materially from actual results changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the holding period of an asset or asset group which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the companys financial condition or operating performance to the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value 

the fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the traditional discounted cash flow approach such cash flow projections take into account expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other relevant criteria and therefore are subject to management judgment changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land we generally use market data and comparable sales information 

these subjective assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment charge results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income there can be no assurance that we will not take additional charges in the future related to the impairment of our assets any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our net income in the period in which the charge is taken 

adverse global market and economic conditions could cause us to recognize impairment charges or otherwise harm our performance 

we are unable to predict the timing severity and length of adverse market and economic conditions adverse market and economic conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flow to pay expenses maintain properties pay distributions to our stock and unit holders and refinance debt during adverse periods there may be significant uncertainty in the valuation of our properties and investments that could result in a substantial decrease in their value no assurance can be given that we would be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our properties and investments in the future our failure to do so would require us to recognize impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion which could materially and adversely affect us and the market price of our common stock 

 12 

unsuccessful development activities or a slowdown in development activities could have a direct impact on our revenues revenue growth andor net income 

we actively pursue development opportunities development activities require various government and other approvals for entitlements and any delay in such approvals may significantly delay the development process we may not recover our investment in development projects for which approvals are not received we incur other risks associated with development activities including 

 

if we expand into new markets we may not be successful which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if opportunities arise we may acquire properties in new markets each of the risks applicable to our ability to acquire and integrate successfully and operate properties in our current markets is also applicable in new markets in addition we may not possess the same level of familiarity with the dynamics and market conditions of the new markets we may enter which could adversely affect the results of our expansion into those markets and we may be unable to achieve our desired return on our investments in new markets if we are unsuccessful in expanding into new markets it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our acquisition activities may not produce the returns that we expect 

our investment strategy includes investing in highquality shopping centers that are leased to marketdominant grocers categoryleading anchors specialty retailers or restaurants located in areas with high barriers to entry and above average household incomes and population densities the acquisition of properties andor companies entails risks that include but are not limited to the following any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

 

we may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or releasing space 

we derive most of our revenue from rent received from our tenants we are subject to the risks that upon expiration or termination of leases leases for space in our properties may not be renewed space may not be released or the terms of renewal or release including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable than current lease terms as a result our results of operations and our net income could be adversely impacted 

 13 

we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly our inability to respond promptly to unfavorable changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our stock and unit holders 

certain of the properties in our portfolio are subject to ground leases if we are found to be in breach of a ground lease or are unable to renew a ground lease we could be materially and adversely affected 

we have 24  properties in our portfolio of 307  properties that are either completely or partially on land subject to ground leases with third parties accordingly we only own longterm leasehold or similar interest in those properties if we are found to be in breach of a ground lease we could lose our interest in the improvements and the right to operate the property that is subject to the ground lease in addition unless we can purchase a fee interest in the underlying land or extend the terms of these leases before or at their expiration as to which no assurance can be given we will lose our interest in the improvements and the right to operate such properties the existing lease terms including renewal options were taken into consideration when making our investment decisions the purchase price and subsequent improvements are being depreciated over the shorter of the remaining life of the ground leases or the useful life of the underlying assets if we were to lose the right to operate a property due to a breach or not exercising renewal options of the ground lease we would be unable to derive income from such property which would impair the value of our investments and materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

geographic concentration of our properties makes our business vulnerable to natural disasters severe weather conditions and climate change which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and operating results 

a significant portion of our property gross leasable area is located in areas that are susceptible to earthquakes tropical storms hurricanes tornadoes wildfires sealevel rise and other natural disasters and impacts of climate change as of december 31 2016  approximately 233  153  and 114  of our property gross leasable area on a prorata basis was located in california  florida  and texas  respectively intense weather conditions during the last decade have caused our cost of property insurance to increase significantly we recognize that the frequency and  or intensity of extreme weather events sealevel rise and other climatic changes may continue to increase and as a result our exposure to these events could increase these weather conditions may also disrupt our business and the business of our tenants which could affect the ability of some tenants to pay rent and may reduce the willingness of residents to remain in or move to the affected area therefore as a result of the geographic concentration of our properties we face risks including higher costs such as uninsured property losses and higher insurance premiums and disruptions to our business and the businesses of our tenants 

an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the insurance coverage on our properties could subject us to loss of capital or revenue on those properties 

we carry comprehensive liability fire flood extended coverage rental loss and environmental insurance for our properties with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties we believe that the insurance carried on our properties is adequate and consistent with industry standards there are however some types of losses such as losses from hurricanes terrorism wars or earthquakes for which the insurance levels carried may not be sufficient to fully cover catastrophic losses impacting multiple properties in addition tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons or damage to personal or real property on or off the premises due to activities conducted by tenants or their agents on the properties including without limitation any environmental contamination and at the tenants expense to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease liability and property damage insurance policies however our tenants may not properly maintain their insurance policies or have the ability to pay the deductibles associated with such policies should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from such properties which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition as well as our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders 

loss of our key personnel could adversely affect our business and operations 

we depend on the efforts of our key executive personnel although we have developed a succession plan and believe qualified replacements could be found for our key executives the loss of their services could adversely affect our business and operations 

 14 

we face competition from numerous sources including other reits and other real estate owners 

the ownership of shopping centers is highly fragmented we face competition from other reits and well capitalized institutional investors as well as from numerous small owners in the acquisition ownership and leasing of shopping centers we also compete to develop shopping centers with other reits engaged in development activities as well as with local regional and national real estate developers this competition may 

 

if we cannot successfully compete in our targeted markets our cash flow and therefore distributions to stock and unit holders may be adversely affected 

costs of environmental remediation could reduce our cash flow available for distribution to stock and unit holders 

under various federal state and local laws an owner or manager of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on the property these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances the cost of any required remediation could exceed the value of the property andor the aggregate assets of the owner or the responsible party the presence of or the failure to properly remediate hazardous or toxic substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a contaminated property or to use the property as collateral for a loan any of these developments could reduce cash flow and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders 

compliance with the americans with disabilities act and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures 

all of our properties are required to comply with the americans with disabilities act “ada” which generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities compliance with ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants or both while the tenants to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions and typically under tenant leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these tenants to cover costs could be adversely affected in addition we are required to operate the properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations as they may be adopted by governmental entities and become applicable to the properties we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with these requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our financial obligations and make distributions to our stock and unit holders 

if we do not maintain the security of tenantrelated information we could incur substantial costs and become subject to litigation 

we receive certain information about our tenants that depends upon secure transmissions of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments a compromise of our security systems that results in information being obtained by unauthorized persons could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties and require us to expend significant resources related to our information security systems such disruptions could adversely affect our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage our business cyber security attacks and other disruptions could harm our ability to run our business 

we face risks associated with security breaches whether through i cyber attacks or cyber intrusions ii malware or computer viruses and iii people with access or who gain access to our systems and other significant disruptions of our computer networks and related systems the risk of a security breach or disruption particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion has increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased our computer networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform daytoday operations although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our computer networks and related systems and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging a security breach or other disruption involving our computer networks and related systems 

 15 

could significantly disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and as a result disrupt our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

risk factors related to our coinvestment partnerships and acquisition structure 

we do not have voting control over our joint venture investments so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued 

we have invested substantial capital as a partner in a number of joint venture investments for the acquisition or development of properties these investments involve risks not present in a whollyowned project as we do not have voting control over the ventures although we do have approval rights over major decisions the other partner may i have interests or goals that are inconsistent with our interests or goals or ii otherwise impede our objectives the other partner also may become insolvent or bankrupt these factors could limit the return that we receive from such investments or cause our cash flows to be lower than our estimates 

the termination of our coinvestment partnerships could adversely affect our cash flow operating results and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders 

if coinvestment partnerships owning a significant number of properties were dissolved for any reason we would lose the asset and property management fees from these coinvestment partnerships which could adversely affect our operating results and our cash available for distribution to stock and unit holders 

risk factors related to funding strategies and capital structure 

higher market capitalization rates for our properties could adversely impact our ability to sell properties and fund developments and acquisitions and could dilute earnings 

as part of our funding strategy we sell operating properties that no longer meet our investment standards or those with a limited future growth profile these sales proceeds are used to fund the construction of new developments redevelopments and acquisitions an increase in market capitalization rates could cause a reduction in the value of centers identified for sale which would have an adverse impact on the amount of cash generated in order to meet the cash requirements of our development program we may be required to sell more properties than initially planned which could have a negative impact on our earnings additionally the sale of properties resulting in significant tax gains could require higher distributions to our stockholders or payment of additional income taxes in order to maintain our reit status it would be our intent to utilize 1031 exchanges to mitigate taxable income however there can be no assurance that we will identify properties that meet our investment objectives for acquisitions 

we depend on external sources of capital which may not be available in the future on favorable terms or at all 

to qualify as a reit the parent company must among other things distribute to its stockholders each year at least 90 of its reit taxable income excluding any net capital gains because of these distribution requirements we may not be able to fund all future capital needs with income from operations we therefore will have to rely on thirdparty sources of capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all our access to thirdparty sources of capital depends on a number of things including the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings our access to debt depends on our credit rating the willingness of creditors to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets in addition to finding creditors willing to lend to us we are dependent upon our joint venture partners to contribute their pro rata share of any amount needed to repay or refinance existing debt when lenders reduce the amount of debt our joint ventures are eligible to refinance 

in addition our existing debt arrangements also impose covenants that limit our flexibility in obtaining other financing additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders interests and additional debt financing may substantially increase our degree of leverage 

without access to external sources of capital we would be required to pay outstanding debt with our operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales our operating cash flows may not be sufficient to pay our outstanding debt as it comes due and real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly at a return we believe is appropriate if we are required to deleverage our business with operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales we may be forced to reduce the amount of or eliminate altogether our distributions to stock and unit holders or refrain from making investments in our business 

 16 

our debt financing may adversely affect our business and financial condition 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance which to a certain extent is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control in addition we do not expect to generate sufficient funds from operations to make balloon principal payments on our debt when due if we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms we may be forced i to dispose of properties which might result in losses or ii to obtain financing at unfavorable terms either of which could reduce the cash flow available for distributions to stock and unit holders if we cannot make required mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose on the property securing the mortgage 

covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition 

our unsecured notes unsecured term loan and unsecured line of credit contain customary covenants including compliance with financial ratios such as ratio of total debt to gross asset value and fixed charge coverage ratio fixed charge coverage ratio is defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda divided by the sum of interest expense and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders our debt arrangements also restrict our ability to enter into a transaction that would result in a change of control these covenants may limit our operational flexibility and our acquisition activities moreover if we breach any of the covenants in our debt agreements and do not cure the breach within the applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately even in the absence of a payment default many of our debt arrangements including our unsecured notes unsecured term loan and unsecured line of credit are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other material debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our stock 

increases in interest rates would cause our borrowing costs to rise and negatively impact our results of operations 

although a significant amount of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates we do borrow funds at variable interest rates under our credit facilities as of december 31 2016  13  of our outstanding debt was variable rate debt increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense on any variable rate debt to the extent we have not hedged our exposure to changes in interest rates in addition increases in interest rates will affect the terms under which we refinance our existing debt as it matures to the extent we have not hedged our exposure to changes in interest rates this would reduce our future earnings and cash flows which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our stock and unit holders 

hedging activity may expose us to risks including the risks that a counterparty will not perform and that the hedge will not yield the economic benefits we anticipate which could adversely affect us 

from time to time we manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements that involve risk such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements and that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes there can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will qualify for hedge accounting or that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations should we desire to terminate a hedging agreement there could be significant costs and cash requirements involved to fulfill our obligations under the hedging agreement failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations 

we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through taxdeferred contribution transactions which could result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell such assets 

we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in our operating partnership which may result in stockholder dilution this acquisition structure may have the effect of among other things reducing the amount of tax depreciation we could deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties and may require that we agree to protect the contributors’ ability to defer recognition of taxable gain through restrictions on our ability to dispose of the acquired properties andor the allocation of partnership debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases these restrictions could limit our ability to sell an asset at a time or on terms that would be favorable absent such restrictions

risk factors related to the market price for our debt and equity securities 

changes in economic and market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our securities 

the market price of our debt and equity securities may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors many of which are out of our control including 

 

these factors may cause the market price of our securities to decline regardless of our financial condition results of operations business or prospects it is impossible to ensure that the market price of our securities including our common stock will not fall in the future a decrease in the market price of our common stock could reduce our ability to raise additional equity in the public markets selling common stock at a decreased market price would have a dilutive impact on existing stockholders 

there is no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates 

our ability to continue to pay dividends at historical rates or to increase our dividend rate will depend on a number of factors including among others the following 

 

if we do not maintain or periodically increase the dividend on our common stock it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and other securities 

changes in accounting standards may adversely impact our financial results 

the financial accounting standards board fasb in conjunction with the sec has several key projects recently completed or on their agenda that could impact how we currently account for our material transactions including lease accounting and other convergence projects with the international accounting standards board the largest projects revenue from contracts with customers and leases have been issued and will be adopted by the company by their effective dates as further described in note 1 we do not currently expect the adoption of the revenue from contracts with customers standard to have a material impact but are still completing our evaluation the leases standard is expected to have an impact specifically to require all of our operating leases for office ground and equipment leases to be recorded on the balance sheet additionally a material change is expected as it relates to accounting for initial direct costs to obtain a lease with a tenant previously capitalizable internal leasing salaries will no longer be capitalizable under the new standard

risk factors related to federal income tax laws 

if the parent company fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes it would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 

we believe that the parent company qualifies for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes and we plan to operate so that we can continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit if the parent company continues to qualify as a reit it generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders many reit requirements however are highly technical and complex the determination that the parent company is a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances some of which may not be totally within our control and some of which involve questions of interpretation for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income must come from specific passive sources like rent that are itemized in the reit tax laws there can be no assurance that the internal revenue service “irs” or a court would agree with the positions we have taken in interpreting the reit requirements we are also required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains the fact that we hold many of our assets through coinvestment partnerships and their subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements furthermore congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult or impossible for the parent company to remain qualified as a reit 

also unless the irs granted relief under certain statutory provisions the parent company would remain disqualified as a reit for four years following the year it first failed to qualify if the parent company failed to qualify as a reit currently andor with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired we would have to pay significant income taxes reducing cash available to pay dividends which would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to pay any dividends to stockholders although we believe that the parent company qualifies as a reit we cannot assure you that the parent company will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes 

even if the parent company qualifies as a reit for federal income tax purposes we are required to pay certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from “prohibited transactions” that income will be subject to a 100 tax in general prohibited transactions include sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business the determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale while we have undertaken a significant number of asset sales in recent years we do not believe that those sales should be considered prohibited transactions but there can be no assurance that the irs would not contend otherwise 

dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates 

subject to limited exceptions dividends paid by reits other than distributions designated as capital gain dividends or returns of capital are not eligible for reduced rates for qualified dividends paid by c corporations and are taxable at ordinary income tax rates the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals trusts and estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could adversely affect the value of the shares of reits including the shares of our capital stock 

foreign stockholders may be subject to us federal income tax on gain recognized on a disposition of our common stock if we do not qualify as a domestically controlled reit 

a foreign person disposing of a us real property interest including shares of a us corporation whose assets consist principally of us real property interests is generally subject to us federal income tax on any gain recognized on the disposition this tax does not apply however to the disposition of stock in a reit if the reit is domestically controlled in general we will be a domestically controlled reit if at all times during the fiveyear period ending on the applicable stockholder’s disposition of our stock less than 50 in value of our stock was held directly or indirectly by nonus persons if we were to fail to qualify as a domestically controlled reit gain recognized by a foreign stockholder on a disposition of our common stock would be subject to us federal income tax unless our common stock was traded on an established securities market and the foreign stockholder did not at any time during a specified testing period directly or indirectly own more than 10 of our outstanding common stock 

legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on us 

  

the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us department of the treasury changes to the tax laws with or without retroactive application could adversely affect our investors or us we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors 

 19 

or us new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us also the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities or an investment in other entities could change making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit 

complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities 

the reit provisions of the code limit our ability to hedge our liabilities generally income from a hedging transaction that constitutes “qualifying income” for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests applicable to reits does not constitute “gross income” for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests provided that we properly identify the hedging transaction pursuant to the applicable sections of the code and treasury regulations to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions or fail to make the proper tax identifications the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests as a result of these rules we may need to limit our use of otherwise advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a taxable reit subsidiary or trs 

risk factors related to our ownership limitations and the florida business corporation act 

restrictions on the ownership of the parent companys capital stock to preserve its reit status could delay or prevent a change in control 

ownership of more than 7 by value of our outstanding capital stock is prohibited with certain exceptions by the parent companys articles of incorporation for the purpose of maintaining its qualification as a reit this 7 limitation may discourage a change in control and may also i deter tender offers for our capital stock which offers may be attractive to our stockholders or ii limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their capital stock that might otherwise exist if an investor attempted to assemble a block in excess of 7 of our outstanding capital stock or to affect a change in control 

the issuance of the parent companys capital stock could delay or prevent a change in control 

the parent companys articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to 30000000 shares of preferred stock and 10000000 shares of special common stock and to establish the preferences and rights of any shares issued the issuance of preferred stock or special common stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control the provisions of the florida business corporation act regarding affiliated transactions could also deter potential acquisitions by preventing the acquiring party from consummating a merger or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of our disinterested stockholders

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are a party to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business except for the matter noted below we are not currently involved in any litigation nor to our knowledge is any litigation threatened against us the outcome of which would in our judgment based on information currently available to us have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

after the announcement of the merger agreement on november 14 2016 a putative class action was filed on behalf of a purported stockholder in the circuit court for duval county florida under the following caption robert garfield on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated vs regency centers corporation martin e stein jr john c schweitzer raymond l bank bryce blair c ronald blankenship j dix druce jr mary lou fiala david p oconnor and thomas g wattles no 162017ca000688xxxxma filed february 3 2017 

the class action alleges among other matters that the definitive joint proxy statementprospectus filed by regency and equity one with the securities and exchange commission the “sec” on january 24 2017 the “joint proxy statementprospectus” omitted certain material information in connection with the merger the complainant seeks various remedies including injunctive relief to prevent the consummation of the merger unless certain allegedly material information is disclosed and seeking compensatory and rescissory damages in the event the merger is consummated without such disclosures 

on february 17 2017 the defendants entered into a stipulation of settlement with respect to the class action pursuant to which the parties have agreed among other things that regency will make certain supplemental disclosures the supplemental disclosures were made by regency in the current report on form 8k filed by regency with the sec on february 17 2017 the supplemental disclosures should be read in conjunction with the joint proxy statementprospectus which should be read in its entirety 

regency believes that the class action is without merit and that no supplemental disclosure is or was required to the joint proxy statementprospectus under any applicable rule statute regulation or law however to among other things eliminate the burden inconvenience expense risk and disruption of further litigation regency has determined to provide supplemental disclosures additional information regarding the stipulation of settlement may be found in the current report on form 8k as filed with the sec on february 17 2017

executing on our strategy 

during 2016  we executed on our strategic objectives to further solidify regency’s position as a leader among shopping center reits 

sustain average annual 3 same property noi growth from a highquality growing portfolio of thriving community and neighborhood shopping centers 

we earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to grocery stores major retail anchors restaurants sideshop retailers and service providers as well as ground leasing or selling outparcels to these same types of tenants we experience growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates in our existing shopping centers by acquiring and developing new shopping centers and by redeveloping shopping centers within our portfolio noteworthy milestones and achievements during 2016  include 

 

develop new high quality shopping centers and redevelop existing centers at attractive returns on investment from a disciplined development program 

we capitalize on our development capabilities market presence and anchor relationships by investing in new developments and redevelopments of existing centers 



 41 

 

costeffectively enhance our balance sheet to reduce our cost of capital provide financial flexibility and weather economic downturns 

we fund acquisitions and development activities from various capital sources including operating cash flows the sale of operating properties that no longer meet our investment standards equity offerings new debt financing and capital from our coinvestment partners 

 

 



leasing activity and significant tenants 

we believe our highquality grocery anchored shopping centers located in densely populated desirable infill trade areas create attractive spaces for retail tenants improvements in the economy combined with historically low levels of new supply and robust tenant demand allow us to focus on merchandising of our centers to ensure the right mix of operators and unique retailers which draws more retail customers to our centers 

prorata occupancy 

for the purpose of the following disclosures of occupancy and leasing activity anchor space is considered space greater than or equal to 10000 sf and shop space is less than 10000 sf the following table summarizes prorata occupancy rates of our combined consolidated and unconsolidated shopping center portfolio 



1 excludes properties in development 

the decline in anchor percent leased is due in part to the bankruptcy of sports authority and its rejection of two leases at our shopping centers see additional discussion below about bankruptcies

significant tenants and concentrations of risk 

we seek to reduce our operating and leasing risks through geographic diversification and by avoiding dependence on any single property market or tenant the following table summarizes our four most significant tenants based on their percentage of annualized base rent each of which is a grocery tenant

bankruptcies and credit concerns 

our management team devotes significant time to researching and monitoring consumer preferences customer shopping behaviors alternative retail methods accessible via the internet and demographics in order to anticipate the challenges and opportunities impacting the retail industry we closely monitor the operating performance and rent collections of the tenants in our shopping centers but also those retailers experiencing significant changes to their business models as a result of reduced customer traffic in their stores and increased competition from internet sales retailers who are unable to withstand these and other business pressures such as operating and financing their business may approach us to modify their lease agreement or file bankruptcy although base rent is supported by longterm lease contracts tenants who file bankruptcy generally have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues currently no tenant represents more than 5 of our annual base rent on a prorata basis also as a result of our research and findings we may reduce new leasing suspend leasing or curtail the allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements within a certain retail category or to a specific retailer in order to reduce our risk from bankruptcies and store closings 

during march 2016 sports authority filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection at which time we had three leases in our portfolio one of those leases has been assumed by another retailer and the remaining two have been rejected and the stores closed those two rejected leases represented 21 million or 04 of total annualized base rent on a prorata basis however we have since executed leases to retenant these spaces 

during 2016 sears holdings announced that it planned to accelerate the closing of a number of stores sears continues to report significant declines in operating revenues and performance and its ability to continue operating stores in our shopping centers is uncertain we have five sears or kmart leases in our portfolio which currently represent 31 million or 06 of total annualized base rent on a prorata basis none of the announced store closures as of this filing are within our shopping centers however we are currently working to opportunistically retenant the spaces as the lease terms permit

results from operations 

comparison of the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  

our total revenues increased as summarized in the following table   



minimum rent increased as follows 

 

 

 

 

recoveries from tenants represent reimbursements to us for tenants prorata share of the operating maintenance and real estate tax expenses that we incur to operate our shopping centers recoveries from tenants increased as follows 

 

 

 

 

other income which consists of incidental income earned at our centers increased 38 million  as follows 

 

 

  

changes in our operating expenses are summarized in the following table   



depreciation and amortization costs increased as follows 



 45 

 

operating and maintenance costs increased as follows 

 

real estate taxes increased as follows 

 

other operating expenses increased 62 million  primarily due to costs incurred from 2016 acquisition activities including costs associated with the announced pending merger of equity one inc 

  

the following table presents the components of other expense income 



the 119 million  decrease in total interest expense is due to 

 

 

 

during 2016 we recognized 42 million  of impairment losses on two operating properties and two land parcels one of the operating properties and both land parcels have since been sold we did not recognize any impairments during 2015 

 46 

we redeemed all of our outstanding 400 million notes in two tranches occurring in 2016 and 2015 during 2016 we recognized a 142 million charge when redeeming the 300 million notes during 2015 we early redeemed 100 million of those same notes which included an 82 million makewhole premium charge 

net investment income increased 10 million  driven by realized and unrealized gains on investments held within the nonqualified deferred compensation plan during 2016 

we recognized a 406 million charge to settle 220 million of forward starting interest rate swaps related to new debt previously expected to be issued in 2017 as a result of our july 2016 equity offering and the early redemption of the 300 million notes in august 2016 the company believed that the issuance of new fixed rate debt within the remaining period of the forward starting swaps was probable to no longer occur accordingly we ceased hedge accounting and reclassified the 406 million paid to settle the forward starting swaps from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings 

our equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships increased as follows   



the 340 million  increase in our equity in income in investments in real estate partnerships is largely attributed to i our share of gains on the sale of real estate within our grir columbia i columbia ii and other investments in real estate partnerships ii interest expense savings within grir resulting from decreased debt balances and refinancing activity at lower interest rates and iii and a decrease in depreciation expense within grir from fully depreciated land improvement assets 

  

the following represents the remaining components that comprise net income attributable to the common stockholders and unit holders 



during 2016 we sold eleven  operating properties and sixteen  land parcels resulting in gains of 473 million  compared to gains of 356 million  from the sale of five  operating properties and two  land parcels during 2015

minimum rent increased as follows 

 

 

 

 

recoveries from tenants represent reimbursements to us for tenants prorata share of the operating maintenance and 

real estate tax expenses that we incur to operate our shopping centers recoveries from tenants increased as follows 

 

 

 

 

other income which consists of incidental income earned at our centers decreased primarily as a result of a lower level of settlement and lease termination income earned in 2015 

  

 48 

we earn fees at marketbased rates for asset management property management leasing acquisition and financing services that we provided to our coinvestment partnerships and third parties as follows   



asset and property management fees increased due to higher property values and revenues in our coinvestment partnerships leasing commissions and other fees increased during 2015 due to the higher average rents on leasing transactions 

changes in our operating expenses are summarized in the following table   



  

depreciation and amortization decreased as follows 

 

 

operating and maintenance costs increased as follows 

 

 

 

 

general and administrative expenses increased as follows 

 

 

 

real estate taxes increased as follows 

 

 

 

 49 

 

the following table presents the components of other expense income 



  

the 69 million decrease in interest expense net is mainly due to lower interest rates from refinancing our longterm debt during 2014 and 2015 and lower outstanding balances on notes payable 

we had no impairment losses during 2015 however during the year ended december 31 2014 we recognized a 11 million loss on the disposal of one operating property and one land parcel and a 175000 impairment on two parcels of land held 

during november 2015 we incurred an 82 million charge from a makewhole premium on our 1000 million early redemption of the 4000 million outstanding 5875 senior unsecured notes that are due in 2017 

net investment income decreased 88 million largely driven by an 81 million gain realized on the sale of availableforsale securities in 2014 and a 11  million decrease in the fair value of plan assets in the nonqualified deferred compensation plan during 2015 which is consistent with the change in plan liabilities included in general and administrative expenses above 

during the year ended december 31 2014 we acquired the remaining 50 interest and gained control of a previously unconsolidated investment in a real estate partnership that owns a single operating property as the operating property constitutes a business acquisition of control was accounted for as a step acquisition and the net assets acquired were recognized at fair value the gain of 183 million was recognized as the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the companys previously held equity interest using an income approach to measure fair value

our equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships increased decreased as follows   



  

the 88 million net decrease is largely attributed to 

grir   44 million increase driven by 

 columbia i   18 million decrease from impairment loss upon the sale of one operating property during 2015 

columbia ii    424000 increase due to impairment losses recognized upon the sale of two properties during 2014 and 

other investments in real estate partnerships  114 million decrease within our other investment partnerships driven by the 109 million gains on the sale of two land parcels and two operating properties during 2014 

the following represents the remaining components that comprise net income attributable to the common stockholders and unit holders 



a 10 million tax benefit was recognized in 2014 upon the receipt of a state tax refund from amending our prior tax returns 

we recognized 356 million of gains on the sale of real estate net of taxes in 2015 attributable to the sale of five operating properties and two land parcels as compared to 551 million of gains on the sale of real estate net of taxes in 2014 attributable to the sale of eleven operating properties and six land parcels 

income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased 10 million due to to the 2014 acquisition of a portfolio held within a consolidated partnership coupled with new operating activity from a development beginning operations and a recent redevelopment completion within our consolidated partnerships

supplemental earnings information 

we use certain nongaap performance measures in addition to the required gaap presentations as we believe these measures improve the understanding of the companys operating results we manage our entire real estate portfolio without regard to ownership structure although certain decisions impacting properties owned through partnerships require partner approval therefore we believe presenting our prorata share of operating results regardless of ownership structure along with other nongaap measures may assist in comparing the companys operating results to other reits we continually evaluate the usefulness relevance limitations and calculation of our reported nongaap performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public and thus such reported measures could change

liquidity and capital resources 

general 

we use cash flows generated from operating investing and financing activities to strengthen our balance sheet and reduce risk finance our development and redevelopment projects fund our targeted investments and maintain financial flexibility we continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt or equity to repay maturing debt or fund our capital commitments 

our parent company has no capital commitments other than its guarantees of the commitments of our operating partnership the parent company will from time to time access the capital markets for the purpose of issuing new equity and will simultaneously contribute all of the offering proceeds to the operating partnership in exchange for additional partnership units all debt is issued by our operating partnership or by our coinvestment partnerships based upon our available sources of capital our current credit ratings and the number of high quality unencumbered properties we own we believe our available capital resources are sufficient to meet our expected capital needs in addition to its 133 million  of cash the company has the following additional sources of capital available 

  

we operate our business such that we expect net cash flow from operating activities will provide the necessary funds to pay our distributions to our common and preferred stock and unit holders which were 2224 million  and 2028 million  for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively our dividend distribution policy is set by our board of directors who monitors our financial position our board of directors recently declared a common stock dividend of 051  per share payable on march 1 2017  future dividends will be declared at the discretion of our board of directors and will be subject to capital requirements and availability we plan to continue paying an aggregate amount of distributions to our stock and unit holders that at a minimum meet the requirements to continue qualifying as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

during the next twelve months we estimate that we will require approximately 2402 million  of cash including 1499 million  to complete inprocess developments and redevelopments 863 million  to repay maturing debt and 40 million  to fund our prorata share of estimated capital contributions to our coinvestment partnerships for repayment of maturing debt if we start new developments redevelop additional shopping centers or commit to new acquisitions our cash requirements will increase if we refinance maturing debt our cash requirements will decrease to meet our cash requirements we may utilize cash generated from operations proceeds from the sale of real estate available borrowings from our line and when the capital markets are favorable proceeds from the sale of equity and the issuance of new longterm debt these estimated needs reflect regencys needs as a standalone entity and is not meant to reflect or give effect to the pending merger with equity one 

we endeavor to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets as of december 31 2016  830 of our whollyowned real estate assets were unencumbered such assets allow us to access the secured and unsecured debt markets and to 

 55 

maintain availability on the line our coverage ratio including our prorata share of our partnerships was 33 and 28 times for the trailing four quarters ended december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  respectively we define our coverage ratio as earnings before interest taxes investment transaction profits net of deal costs depreciation and amortization “core ebitda” divided by the sum of the gross interest and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders 

our line term loan and unsecured loans require that we remain in compliance with various covenants which are 

described in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements we are in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2016  and expect to remain in compliance 

subsequent events 

subsequent to december 31 2016  the company priced a public offering of two tranches of senior unsecured notes 

 

   

in connection with the pending merger the company has commitments to i amend its line by increasing the borrowing capacity to 10 billion  and ii enter a new 3000 million  term loan facility both of these transactions are contingent upon the consummation of the merger and are scheduled to close simultaneously with the merger the company plans to use the proceeds from the new term loan to repay existing term loans held by equity one the additional line capacity will accommodate the companys increased property operations and development  redevelopment programs from the merger

significant investing and divesting activities included 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 57 

we plan to continue developing and redeveloping shopping centers for longterm investment purposes we deployed capital of 2346 million  for the development redevelopment and improvement of our real estate properties as comprised of the following 

  

 

 

 building construction and tenant improvement costs the size and scope of each redevelopment project 

varies with each redevelopment plan 

 

 development costs expended we cease interest capitalization when the property is no longer being 

developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements but in no event 

would we capitalize interest on the project beyond 12 months after the anchor opens for business capitalized 

interest decreased in 2016 as compared to 2015 as our development or redevelopment projects neared 

substantial completion and we commenced fewer new projects during the first half of 2016  

 compensation costs directly attributable to these activities are capitalized as part of each project changes in 

the level of future development and redevelopment activity could adversely impact results of operations by 

reducing the amount of internal costs for development and redevelopment projects that may be capitalized a 

10 reduction in development and redevelopment activity without a corresponding reduction in the 

compensation costs directly related to our development and redevelopment activities could result in an 

additional charge to net income of 14 million per year 

  

 the following table summarizes our development projects

significant financing activities during the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  include the following 

 

during 2015 we issued 29 million shares of common stock at an average price of 6471 in an underwritten forward public equity offering that settled in november 2015 resulting in net proceeds of 1858 million additionally we issued 189266  shares of common stock through our atm program at an average price of 6786  per share resulting in net proceeds of 127 million

during 2015 we used 5401 million  to repay debt including 

 

   

 60 

contractual obligations 

we have debt obligations related to our mortgage loans unsecured notes unsecured credit facilities and interest rate swap obligations as described further below and in note 6 and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements we have shopping centers that are subject to noncancelable longterm ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to us to construct andor operate a shopping center in addition we have noncancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from which we conduct our business 

the following table of contractual obligations summarizes our debt maturities including our prorata share of obligations within coinvestment partnerships as of december 31 2016  and excludes the following 

 

 

 

   

1  includes interest payments 

2  we are obligated to contribute our prorata share to fund maturities if they are not refinanced we believe that our partners are financially sound and have sufficient capital or access thereto to fund future capital requirements in the event that a coinvestment partner was unable to fund its share of the capital requirements of the coinvestment partnership we would have the right but not the obligation to loan the defaulting partner the amount of its capital call   

critical accounting estimates 

knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial statements the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities as of a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period these accounting estimates are based upon but not limited to our judgments about historical and expected future results current market conditions and interpretation of industry accounting standards they are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness however the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates 

 61 

accounts receivable and straight line rent 

minimum rent percentage rent and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs insurance and real estate taxes are the companys principal source of revenue as a result of generating this revenue we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants we are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that may affect the collection of outstanding receivables to address the collectability of these receivables we analyze historical tenant collection rates writeoff experience tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts and straight line rent reserve although we estimate uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income actual experience may differ from those estimates 

real estate investments 

acquisition of real estate investments 

upon acquisition of real estate operating properties the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land building building improvements and tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and belowmarket leases and inplace leases assumed debt and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date based on these estimates the company allocates the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities fair value is determined based on an exit price approach which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date if up to one year from the acquisition date information regarding fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation on a retrospective basis the company expenses transaction costs associated with business combinations in the period incurred 

we strategically coinvest with partners to own manage acquire develop and redevelop operating properties we analyze our investments in real estate partnerships in order to determine whether the entity should be consolidated if it is determined that these investments do not require consolidation because the entities are not variable interest entities “vies” we are not considered the primary beneficiary of the entities determined to be vies we do not have voting control andor the limited partners or nonmanaging members have substantive kickout or participation rights then the selection of the accounting method used to account for our investments in real estate partnerships is generally determined by our voting interests and the degree of influence we have over the entity management uses its judgment when making these determinations we use the equity method of accounting for investments in real estate partnerships when we own 20 or more of the voting interests and have significant influence but do not have a controlling financial interest or if we own less than 20 of the voting interests but have determined that we have significant influence under the equity method we record our investments in and advances to these entities as investments in real estate partnerships in our consolidated balance sheets and our proportionate share of earnings or losses earned by the joint venture is recognized in equity in income loss of investments in real estate partnerships in our consolidated statements of operations 

  

development of real estate assets and cost capitalization 

we capitalize the acquisition of land the construction of buildings and other specifically identifiable development costs incurred by recording them in properties in development in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets other specifically identifiable development costs include predevelopment costs essential to the development process as well as interest real estate taxes and direct employee costs incurred during the development period once a development property is substantially complete and held available for occupancy these indirect costs are no longer capitalized 



 62 

related to the actual level of development activity occurring during the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  we capitalized 130 million  138 million  and 161 million  respectively of direct internal costs incurred to support our development program 

valuation of real estate investments 

we evaluate whether there are any indicators that have occurred including property operating performance and general market conditions that would result in us determining that the carrying value of our real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may not be recoverable if such indicators occur we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions including rental rates costs of tenant improvements leasing commissions anticipated hold period and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition including the exit capitalization rate these key assumptions are subjective in nature and the resulting impairment if any could differ from the actual gain or loss recognized upon ultimate sale in an arms length transaction if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the companys financial condition or operating performance 

we evaluate our investments in real estate partnerships for impairment whenever there are indicators including underlying property operating performance and general market conditions that the value of our investments in real estate partnerships may be impaired an investment in a real estate partnerships is considered impaired only if we determine that its fair value is less than the net carrying value of the investment in that real estate partnerships on an otherthantemporary basis cash flow projections for the investments consider property level factors such as expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other factors we consider various qualitative factors to determine if a decrease in the value of our investment is otherthantemporary these factors include the age of the real estate partnerships our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity the financial condition and longterm prospects of the entity and relationships with our partners and banks if we believe that the decline in the fair value of the investment is temporary no impairment charge is recorded if our analysis indicates that there is an otherthantemporary impairment related to the investment in a particular real estate partnership the carrying value of the investment will be adjusted to an amount that reflects the estimated fair value of the investment 

the fair value of real estate investments is subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization or the traditional discounted cash flow methods such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other factors and therefore are subject to management judgment and changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land we generally use market data and comparable sales information 

derivative instruments 

the company utilizes financial derivative instruments to manage risks associated with changing interest rates specifically the company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or future payment of known and uncertain cash amounts the amount of which are determined by interest rates the companys derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount timing and duration of the companys known or expected cash payments principally related to the companys borrowings for additional information on the company’s use and accounting for derivatives see notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

the company assesses effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at inception and on an ongoing basis the effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and our consolidated statement of equity our cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not perfectly match such as notional amounts settlement dates reset dates calculation period and libor rate if a cash flow hedge is deemed ineffective the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected 

the fair value of the companys interest rate derivatives is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives including the period to maturity and uses observable marketbased inputs including interest rate curves and implied volatilities the company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterpartys nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 to consolidated financial statements 

environmental matters 

we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers and underground petroleum storage tanks we believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations generally we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to more environmentally friendly systems where available we have applied and been accepted into statesponsored environmental programs we have a blanket environmental insurance policy for thirdparty liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination we have also placed environmental insurance where possible on specific properties with known contamination in order to mitigate our environmental risk we monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites we also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so 

as of december 31 2016  we and our investments in real estate partnerships had accrued liabilities of 89 million  for our prorata share of environmental remediation we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations however we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities that any previous owner occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants by the condition of nearby properties or by unrelated third parties or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have offbalance sheet arrangements financings or other relationships with other unconsolidated entities other than our unconsolidated investment partnerships or other persons also known as variable interest entities not previously discussed our unconsolidated investment partnership properties have been financed with nonrecourse loans we have no guarantees related to these loans 

inflationdeflation 

inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers however inflation may become a greater concern in the future substantially all of our longterm leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation most of our leases require tenants to pay their prorata share of operating expenses including commonarea maintenance real estate taxes insurance and utilities thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation in addition many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years which permits us to seek increased rents upon rerental at market rates however during deflationary periods or periods of economic weakness minimum rents and percentage rents will decline as the supply of available retail space exceeds demand and consumer spending declines occupancy declines resulting from a weak economic period will also likely result in lower recovery rates of our operating expenses

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to two significant components of interest rate risk 

 

 

we continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt to repay maturing debt or fund our commitments based upon the current capital markets our current credit ratings our current capacity under our unsecured credit facilities and the number of high quality unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings we expect that we will be able to successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund these debt obligations 

our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the table below presents the principal cash flows weighted average interest rates of remaining debt and the fair value of total debt as of december 31 2016  dollars in thousands the table is presented by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes although the average interest rate for variable rate debt is included in the table those rates represent rates that existed as of december 31 2016  and are subject to change on a monthly basis further the table below incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2016  and does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date since firm commitments are not presented the table has limited predictive value as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at that time and actual interest rates

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate certain hazardous or toxic substances at our shopping centers these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances the cost of required remediation and the owners liability for remediation could exceed the value of the property andor the aggregate assets of the owner the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral although we have a number of properties that could require or are currently undergoing varying levels of environmental remediation known environmental remediation is not currently expected to have a material financial impact on us due to insurance programs designed to mitigate the cost of remediation various stateregulated programs that shift the responsibility and cost to the state and existing accrued liabilities for remediation

 item 1a risk factors 

risk factors related to our industry and real estate investments 

a shift in retail shopping from brick and mortar stores to internet sales may have an adverse impact on our revenues and cash flow 

many retailers operating brick and mortar stores have made internet sales a vital piece of their business although many of the retailers in our shopping centers either provide services or sell groceries such that their customer base does not have a tendency toward online shopping the shift to internet sales may adversely impact our retail tenants sales causing those retailers to adjust the size or number of retail locations in the future this shift could adversely impact our occupancy and rental rates which would impact our revenues and cash flows 

downturns in the retail industry likely will have a direct adverse impact on our revenues and cash flow 

our properties consist primarily of groceryanchored shopping centers our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space the market for retail space could be adversely affected by any of the following 

 

to the extent that any of these conditions occur they are likely to impact market rents for retail space occupancy in the operating portfolios our ability to sell acquire or develop properties and our cash available for distributions to stock and unit holders 

our revenues and cash flow could be adversely affected if economic or market conditions deteriorate where our properties are geographically concentrated which may impede our ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses and maintain our properties 

the economic conditions in markets in which our properties are concentrated greatly influence our financial performance during the year ended december 31 2015  our properties in california  florida  and texas  accounted for 304  121  and 103  respectively of our net operating income from consolidated properties plus our prorata share from unconsolidated properties prorata basis our revenues and cash available to pay expenses maintain our properties and for distributions to stock and unit holders could be adversely affected by this geographic concentration if market conditions such as supply of or demand for retail space deteriorate in california  florida  or texas  relative to other geographic areas 

our success depends on the success and continued presence of our “anchor” tenants 

anchor tenants those occupying 10000 square feet or more occupy large amounts of square footage pay a significant portion of the total rents at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by drawing significant numbers of customers to a property     we derive significant revenues from anchor tenants such as kroger  publix  and albertsonssafeway  who accounted for 47  37  and 29  respectively of our total annualized base rent on a prorata basis for the year ended december 31 2015  our net income could be adversely affected by the loss of revenues in the event a significant tenant 

 

 5 

some anchors have the right to vacate and prevent retenanting by paying rent for the balance of the lease term vacated anchor space including space owned by the anchor can reduce rental revenues generated by the shopping center because of the loss of the departed anchor tenants customer drawing power if a significant tenant vacates a property cotenancy clauses in select centers may allow other tenants to modify or terminate their rent or lease obligations cotenancy clauses have several variants they may allow a tenant to postpone a store opening if certain other tenants fail to open their stores they may allow a tenant to close its store prior to lease expiration if another tenant closes its store prior to lease expiration or more commonly they may allow a tenant to pay reduced levels of rent until a certain number of tenants open their stores within the same shopping center 

a significant percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller shop tenants and our net income could be adversely impacted if our smaller shop tenants are not successful 

a significant percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller shop tenants those occupying less than 10000 square feet smaller shop tenants may be more vulnerable to negative economic conditions as they have more limited resources than larger tenants such tenants continue to face increasing competition from nonstore retailers and growing ecommerce in addition some of these retailers may seek to reduce their store sizes as they increasingly rely on alternative distribution channels including internet sales and adjust their square footage needs accordingly the types of smaller shop tenants vary from retail shops to service providers if we are unable to attract the right type or mix of smaller shop tenants into our centers our net income could be adversely impacted 

we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy 

although minimum rent is supported by longterm lease contracts tenants who file bankruptcy have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and rejects its leases we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues and may not be able to collect all prepetition amounts owed by that party 

our real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges 

our longlived assets primarily real estate held for investment are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable we evaluate whether there are any indicators including property operating performance and general market conditions that the value of the real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may not be recoverable through the evaluation we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions including rental rates costs of tenant improvements leasing commissions anticipated holding periods and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition including the exit capitalization rate these key assumptions are subjective in nature and could differ materially from actual results changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the holding period of an asset or asset group which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the companys financial condition or operating performance to the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value 

the fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the traditional discounted cash flow approach such cash flow projections consider factors including expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other factors and therefore are subject to management judgment changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land we generally use market data and comparable sales information 

these subjective assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment charge results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income there can be no assurance that we will not take additional charges in the future related to the impairment of our assets any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our net income in the period in which the charge is taken 

adverse global market and economic conditions could cause us to recognize impairment charges or otherwise harm our performance 

we are unable to predict the timing severity and length of adverse market and economic conditions adverse market and economic conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flow to pay expenses maintain properties pay distributions to our stock and unit holders and refinance debt during adverse periods there may be significant uncertainty in the valuation of our properties and investments that could result in a substantial decrease in their value no 

 6 

assurance can be given that we would be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our properties and investments in the future our failure to do so would require us to recognize impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion which could materially and adversely affect us and the market price of our common stock 

unsuccessful development activities or a slowdown in development activities could have a direct impact on our revenues revenue growth andor net income 

we actively pursue development opportunities development activities require various government and other approvals for entitlements and any delay in such approvals may significantly delay the development process we may not recover our investment in development projects for which approvals are not received we incur other risks associated with development activities including 

 

if we expand into new markets we may not be successful which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if opportunities arise we may acquire properties in new markets each of the risks applicable to our ability to acquire and integrate successfully and operate properties in our current markets is also applicable in new markets in addition we may not possess the same level of familiarity with the dynamics and market conditions of the new markets we may enter which could adversely affect the results of our expansion into those markets and we may be unable to achieve our desired return on our investments in new markets if we are unsuccessful in expanding into new markets it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our acquisition activities may not produce the returns that we expect 

our investment strategy includes investing in highquality shopping centers that are leased to marketdominant grocers categoryleading anchors specialty retailers or restaurants located in areas with high barriers to entry and above average household incomes and population densities the acquisition of properties andor companies entails risks that include but are not limited to the following any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

 

 7 

we may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or releasing space 

we derive most of our revenue from rent received from our tenants we are subject to the risks that upon expiration or termination of leases leases for space in our properties may not be renewed space may not be released or the terms of renewal or release including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable than current lease terms as a result our results of operations and our net income could be adversely impacted 

we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly our inability to respond promptly to unfavorable changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our stock and unit holders 

a number of properties in our portfolio are subject to ground leases if we are found to be in breach of a ground lease or are unable to renew a ground lease we could be materially and adversely affected 

we have properties in our portfolio that are either completely or partially on land subject to ground leases with third parties accordingly we only own longterm leasehold or similar interest in those properties if we are found to be in breach of a ground lease we could lose our interest in the improvements and the right to operate the property that is subject to the ground lease in addition unless we can purchase a fee interest in the underlying land or extend the terms of these leases before or at their expiration as to which no assurance can be given we will lose our interest in the improvements and the right to operate such properties the existing lease terms including renewal options were taken into consideration when making our investment decisions the purchase price and subsequent improvements are being depreciated over the shorter of the remaining life of the ground leases or the useful life of the underlying assets if we were to lose the right to operate a property due to a breach or not exercising renewal options of the ground lease we would be unable to derive income from such property which would impair the value of our investments and materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

geographic concentration of our properties makes our business vulnerable to natural disasters and severe weather conditions which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and operating results 

a significant portion of our property gross leasable area is located in areas that are susceptible to earthquakes tropical storms hurricanes tornadoes wildfires and other natural disasters as of december 31 2015  approximately 232  157  and 105  of our property gross leasable area on a prorata basis was located in california  florida  and texas  respectively intense weather conditions during the last decade have caused our cost of property insurance to increase significantly we recognize that the frequency and  or intensity of extreme weather events may continue to increase due to climate change and as a result our exposure to these events could increase these weather conditions also disrupt our business and the business of our tenants which could affect the ability of some tenants to pay rent and may reduce the willingness of residents to remain in or move to the affected area therefore as a result of the geographic concentration of our properties we face risks including higher costs such as uninsured property losses and higher insurance premiums and disruptions to our business and the businesses of our tenants 

an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the insurance coverage on our properties could subject us to loss of capital or revenue on those properties 

we carry comprehensive liability fire flood extended coverage rental loss and environmental insurance for our properties with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties we believe that the insurance carried on our properties is adequate and consistent with industry standards there are however some types of losses such as losses from hurricanes terrorism wars or earthquakes for which the insurance levels carried may not be sufficient to fully cover catastrophic losses impacting multiple properties in addition tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons or damage to personal or real property on or off the premises due to activities conducted by tenants or their agents on the properties including without limitation any environmental contamination and at the tenants expense to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease liability and property damage insurance policies however our tenants may not properly maintain their insurance policies or have the ability to pay the deductibles associated with such policies should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from such properties which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition as well as our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders 

 8 

loss of our key personnel could adversely affect our business and operations 

we depend on the efforts of our key executive personnel although we have developed a succession plan and believe qualified replacements could be found for our key executives the loss of their services could adversely affect our business and operations 

we face competition from numerous sources including other reits and other real estate owners 

the ownership of shopping centers is highly fragmented we face competition from other reits and well capitalized institutional investors as well as from numerous small owners in the acquisition ownership and leasing of shopping centers we also compete to develop shopping centers with other reits engaged in development activities as well as with local regional and national real estate developers this competition may 

• reduce the number of properties available for acquisition or development 

• increase the cost of properties available for acquisition or development 

• hinder our ability to attract and retain tenants leading to increased vacancy rates andor reduced rents and 

• adversely affect our ability to minimize our expenses of operation 

if we cannot successfully compete in our targeted markets our cash flow and therefore distributions to stock and unit holders may be adversely affected 

costs of environmental remediation could reduce our cash flow available for distribution to stock and unit holders 

under various federal state and local laws an owner or manager of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on the property these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances the cost of any required remediation could exceed the value of the property andor the aggregate assets of the owner or the responsible party the presence of or the failure to properly remediate hazardous or toxic substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a contaminated property or to use the property as collateral for a loan any of these developments could reduce cash flow and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders 

compliance with the americans with disabilities act and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures 

all of our properties are required to comply with the americans with disabilities act “ada” which generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities compliance with ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants or both while the tenants to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions and typically under tenant leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these tenants to cover costs could be adversely affected in addition we are required to operate the properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations as they may be adopted by governmental entities and become applicable to the properties we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with these requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our financial obligations and make distributions to our stock and unit holders 

if we do not maintain the security of tenantrelated information we could incur substantial costs and become subject to litigation 

we receive certain information about our tenants that depends upon secure transmissions of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments a compromise of our security systems that results in information being obtained by unauthorized persons could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties and require us to expend significant resources related to our information security systems such disruptions could adversely affect our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage our business cyber security attacks and other disruptions could harm our ability to run our business 

we face risks associated with security breaches whether through i cyber attacks or cyber intrusions ii malware or computer viruses and iii people with access or who gain access to our systems and other significant disruptions of our computer networks and related systems the risk of a security breach or disruption particularly through cyber attack or cyber 

 9 

intrusion has increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased our computer networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform daytoday operations although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our computer networks and related systems and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging a security breach or other disruption involving our computer networks and related systems could significantly disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and as a result disrupt our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

risk factors related to our coinvestment partnerships and acquisition structure 

we do not have voting control over our joint venture investments so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued 

we have invested substantial capital as a partner in a number of joint venture investments for the acquisition or development of properties these investments involve risks not present in a whollyowned project as we do not have voting control over the ventures although we do have approval rights over major decisions the other partner may i have interests or goals that are inconsistent with our interests or goals or ii otherwise impede our objectives the other partner also may become insolvent or bankrupt these factors could limit the return that we receive from such investments or cause our cash flows to be lower than our estimates 

the termination of our coinvestment partnerships could adversely affect our cash flow operating results and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders 

if coinvestment partnerships owning a significant number of properties were dissolved for any reason we would lose the asset and property management fees from these coinvestment partnerships which could adversely affect our operating results and our cash available for distribution to stock and unit holders 

risk factors related to funding strategies and capital structure 

higher market capitalization rates for our properties could adversely impact our ability to sell properties and fund developments and acquisitions and could dilute earnings 

as part of our funding strategy we sell operating properties that no longer meet our investment standards or those with a limited future growth profile these sales proceeds are used to fund the construction of new developments redevelopments and acquisitions an increase in market capitalization rates could cause a reduction in the value of centers identified for sale which would have an adverse impact on the amount of cash generated in order to meet the cash requirements of our development program we may be required to sell more properties than initially planned which could have a negative impact on our earnings 

we depend on external sources of capital which may not be available in the future on favorable terms or at all 

to qualify as a reit the parent company must among other things distribute to its stockholders each year at least 90 of its reit taxable income excluding any net capital gains because of these distribution requirements we may not be able to fund all future capital needs with income from operations we therefore will have to rely on thirdparty sources of capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all our access to thirdparty sources of capital depends on a number of things including the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings our access to debt depends on our credit rating the willingness of creditors to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets in addition to finding creditors willing to lend to us we are dependent upon our joint venture partners to contribute their pro rata share of any amount needed to repay or refinance existing debt when lenders reduce the amount of debt our joint ventures are eligible to refinance 

  in addition our existing debt arrangements also impose covenants that limit our flexibility in obtaining other financing such as a prohibition on negative pledge agreements additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders interests and additional debt financing may substantially increase our degree of leverage 

without access to external sources of capital we would be required to pay outstanding debt with our operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales our operating cash flows may not be sufficient to pay our outstanding debt as it comes due and real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly at a return we believe is appropriate if we are required to deleverage our business with operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales we may be forced to reduce the amount of or eliminate altogether our distributions to stock and unit holders or refrain from making investments in our business 

 10 

our debt financing may adversely affect our business and financial condition 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance which to a certain extent is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control in addition we do not expect to generate sufficient funds from operations to make balloon principal payments on our debt when due if we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms we may be forced i to dispose of properties which might result in losses or ii to obtain financing at unfavorable terms either of which could reduce the cash flow available for distributions to stock and unit holders if we cannot make required mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose on the property securing the mortgage 

covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition 

our unsecured notes unsecured term loan and unsecured line of credit contain customary covenants including compliance with financial ratios such as ratio of total debt to gross asset value and fixed charge coverage ratio fixed charge coverage ratio is defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda divided by the sum of interest expense and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders our debt arrangements also restrict our ability to enter into a transaction that would result in a change of control these covenants may limit our operational flexibility and our acquisition activities moreover if we breach any of the covenants in our debt agreements and do not cure the breach within the applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately even in the absence of a payment default many of our debt arrangements including our unsecured notes unsecured term loan and unsecured line of credit are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other material debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our stock 

increases in interest rates would cause our borrowing costs to rise and negatively impact our results of operations 

  

although a significant amount of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates we do borrow funds at variable interest rates under our credit facilities increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense on any variable rate debt to the extent we have not hedged our exposure to changes in interest rates in addition increases in interest rates will affect the terms under which we refinance our existing debt as it matures to the extent we have not hedged our exposure to changes in interest rates this would reduce our future earnings and cash flows which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our stock and unit holders 

hedging activity may expose us to risks including the risks that a counterparty will not perform and that the hedge will 

not yield the economic benefits we anticipate which could adversely affect us 

from time to time we manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements that 

involve risk such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements and that these 

arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes there can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will qualify for hedge accounting or that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations should we desire to terminate a hedging agreement there could be significant costs and cash requirements involved to fulfill our obligations under the hedging agreement failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations 

we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through taxdeferred contribution transactions which could result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell such assets 

we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in our operating partnership which may result in stockholder dilution this acquisition structure may have the effect of among other things reducing the amount of tax depreciation we could deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties and may require that we agree to protect the contributors’ ability to defer recognition of taxable gain through restrictions on our ability to dispose of the acquired properties andor the allocation of partnership debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases these restrictions could limit our ability to sell an asset at a time or on terms that would be favorable absent such restrictions 

 11 

risk factors related to the market price for our debt and equity securities 

changes in economic and market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our securities 

the market price of our debt and equity securities may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors many of which are out of our control including 

 

these factors may cause the market price of our securities to decline regardless of our financial condition results of operations business or prospects it is impossible to ensure that the market price of our securities including our common stock will not fall in the future a decrease in the market price of our common stock could reduce our ability to raise additional equity in the public markets selling common stock at a decreased market price would have a dilutive impact on existing stockholders 

we cannot assure you we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates 

our ability to continue to pay dividends at historical rates or to increase our dividend rate will depend on a number of factors including among others the following 

  

 

if we do not maintain or periodically increase the dividend on our common stock it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and other securities 

changes in accounting standards may adversely impact our financial results 

the financial accounting standards board fasb in conjunction with the sec has several key projects on their agenda that could impact how we currently account for our material transactions including lease accounting and other convergence projects with the international accounting standards board at this time we are unable to predict with certainty which if any proposals may be passed or what level of impact any such proposal could have on the presentation of our consolidated financial statements our results of operations and our financial ratios required by our debt covenants 

  

risk factors related to federal income tax laws 

if the parent company fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes it would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 

we believe that the parent company qualifies for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes and we plan to operate so that we can continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit if the parent company continues to qualify as a reit it generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders many reit requirements however are highly technical and complex the determination that the parent company is a reit requires an 

 12 

analysis of various factual matters and circumstances some of which may not be totally within our control and some of which involve questions of interpretation for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income must come from specific passive sources like rent that are itemized in the reit tax laws there can be no assurance that the internal revenue service “irs” or a court would agree with the positions we have taken in interpreting the reit requirements we are also required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains the fact that we hold many of our assets through coinvestment partnerships and their subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements furthermore congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult or impossible for the parent company to remain qualified as a reit 

also unless the irs granted relief under certain statutory provisions the parent company would remain disqualified as a reit for four years following the year it first failed to qualify if the parent company failed to qualify as a reit currently andor with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired we would have to pay significant income taxes reducing cash available to pay dividends which would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to pay any dividends to stockholders although we believe that the parent company qualifies as a reit we cannot assure you that the parent company will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes 

even if the parent company qualifies as a reit for federal income tax purposes we are required to pay certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from “prohibited transactions” that income will be subject to a 100 tax in general prohibited transactions include sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business the determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale while we have undertaken a significant number of asset sales in recent years we do not believe that those sales should be considered prohibited transactions but there can be no assurance that the irs would not contend otherwise 

dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates 

subject to limited exceptions dividends paid by reits other than distributions designated as capital gain dividends or returns of capital are not eligible for reduced rates for qualified dividends paid by c corporations and are taxable at ordinary income tax rates the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals trusts and estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could adversely affect the value of the shares of reits including the shares of our capital stock 

foreign stockholders may be subject to us federal income tax on gain recognized on a disposition of our common stock if we do not qualify as a domestically controlled reit 

a foreign person disposing of a us real property interest including shares of a us corporation whose assets consist principally of us real property interests is generally subject to us federal income tax on any gain recognized on the disposition this tax does not apply however to the disposition of stock in a reit if the reit is domestically controlled in general we will be a domestically controlled reit if at all times during the fiveyear period ending on the applicable stockholder’s disposition of our stock less than 50 in value of our stock was held directly or indirectly by nonus persons if we were to fail to qualify as a domestically controlled reit gain recognized by a foreign stockholder on a disposition of our common stock would be subject to us federal income tax unless our common stock was traded on an established securities market and the foreign stockholder did not at any time during a specified testing period directly or indirectly own more than 10 of our outstanding common stock 

complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities 

the reit provisions of the code limit our ability to hedge our liabilities generally income from a hedging transaction we enter into either to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings incurred or to be incurred to acquire or carry real estate assets or to manage the risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain or any property which generates such income or gain that constitutes “qualifying income” for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests applicable to reits does not constitute “gross income” for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests provided that we properly identify the hedging transaction pursuant to the applicable sections of the code and treasury regulations to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions or fail to make the proper tax identifications the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests as a result of these rules we may need to limit our use of otherwise advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a taxable reit subsidiary or trs the use of a trs could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our trs would be subject to tax on income or gain resulting from hedges entered into by it or expose us to greater risks than we would 

 13 

otherwise want to bear in addition net losses in a trs will generally not provide any tax benefit except for being carried forward for use against future taxable income in the trs 

risk factors related to our ownership limitations and the florida business corporation act 

restrictions on the ownership of the parent companys capital stock to preserve its reit status could delay or prevent a change in control

our leases for tenant space under 5000 square feet generally have terms ranging from three to five years leases greater than 10000 square feet generally have lease terms in excess of five years mostly comprised of anchor tenants many of the anchor leases contain provisions allowing the tenant the option of extending the term of the lease at expiration our leases provide for the monthly payment in advance of fixed minimum rent additional rents calculated as a percentage of the tenants sales the tenants prorata share of real estate taxes insurance and common area maintenance “cam” expenses and reimbursement for utility costs if not directly metered

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executing on our strategy 

during 2015 we executed on our strategic objectives to further solidify regency’s position as a leader among shopping center reits 

sustain average annual 3 noi growth from a highquality growing portfolio of thriving community and neighborhood shopping centers 

we earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to grocery stores major retail anchors restaurants sideshop retailers and service providers as well as ground leasing or selling outparcels to these same types of tenants we experience growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates in our existing shopping centers by acquiring and developing new shopping centers and by redeveloping shopping centers within our portfolio noteworthy milestones and achievements during 2015 include 

 

develop new high quality shopping centers and redevelop existing centers at attractive returns on investment from a disciplined development program 

we capitalize on our development capabilities market presence and anchor relationships by investing in new developments and redevelopments of existing centers 

 

costeffectively enhance our already strong balance sheet to reduce our cost of capital provide financial flexibility and weather economic downturns 

we fund acquisitions and development activities from various capital sources including operating cash flow property sales through a disciplined matchfunding strategy of selling low growth assets equity offerings new debt financing and capital from our coinvestment partners 

 

 34 

engage a talented and dedicated team that operates efficiently and is recognized as a leader in the real estate industry with respect to development and operating capabilities customer relationships operating and technology systems and environmental sustainability 

 

leasing activity and significant tenants 

we believe our highquality grocery anchored shopping centers located in densely populated desirable infill trade areas create attractive spaces for retail tenants improvements in the economy combined with historically low levels of new supply and robust tenant demand allow us to focus on merchandising of our centers to ensure the right mix of operators and unique retailers which draws more retail customers to our centers 

prorata occupancy 

for the purpose of the following disclosures of occupancy and leasing activity anchor space is considered space greater than or equal to 10000 sf and shop space is less than 10000 sf the following table summarizes prorata occupancy rates of our combined consolidated and unconsolidated shopping center portfolio 



  

the percent leased in our operating portfolio remained constant in 2015  during the fourth quarter of 2015 we successfully recaptured two anchor spaces giving us control over the future tenant mix at these centers and the ability to improve rents our shop space experienced prorata occupancy gains of 50 basis points driven primarily by new leasing and lower than historical moveout rates 

  

prorata leasing activity 

  

the following table summarizes leasing activity including regencys prorata share of activity within the portfolio of our coinvestment partnerships 



 35 



1 number of leasing transactions reported at 100 all other statistics reported at prorata share 

2 totals for base rent tenant improvements and leasing commissions reflect the weighted average per square foot psf 

  overall leasing activity continues to be strong in the shop space category for both new leases and renewals base rent psf continued to increase on leases executed in 2015 in the anchor category base rent psf on new leases decreased slightly due to the geographic location of anchor deals in 2015 as compared to 2014 

significant tenants and concentrations of risk 

we seek to reduce our operating and leasing risks through geographic diversification and by avoiding dependence on any single property market or tenant the following table summarizes our three most significant tenants each of which is a grocery tenant occupying our shopping centers   



1  includes stores owned by grocery anchors that are attached to our centers 

2  includes our prorata share of unconsolidated properties and excludes those owned by anchors 

bankruptcies 

although base rent is supported by longterm lease contracts tenants who file bankruptcy may have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues we monitor the operating performance and rent collections of all tenants in our shopping centers especially those tenants operating retail formats that are experiencing significant changes in competition business practice and store closings in other locations we are not currently aware of the pending bankruptcy or announced store closings of any tenants in our shopping centers that would individually cause a material reduction in our revenues and no tenant represents more than 5 of our annual base rent on a prorata basis 

our management team devotes significant time to monitoring consumer preferences shopping behaviors and demographics to anticipate both challenges and opportunities in the changing retail industry that may affect our tenants as a result of our findings we may reduce new leasing suspend leasing or curtail the allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements within a certain retail category or to a specific retailer

real estate tax expenses that we incur to operate our shopping centers recoveries from tenants increased as follows 

 

 

 

 

other income which consists of incidental income earned at our centers decreased primarily as a result of a higher level of settlement and lease termination income earned in 2014 

we earn fees at marketbased rates for asset management property management leasing acquisition and financing services that we provided to our coinvestment partnerships and third parties as follows 

  

  

  

asset and property management fees increased due to higher property values and revenues in our coinvestment partnerships leasing commissions and other fees increased during 2015 due to the higher average rents on leasing transactions 

  

 37 

changes in our operating expenses are summarized in the following table   



depreciation and amortization decreased as follows 

 

 

operating and maintenance costs increased as follows 

 

 

 

 

general and administrative expenses increased as follows 

 

 

 

real estate taxes increased as follows 

 

 

 

 

 38 

  

the following table presents the components of other expense income 



the 69 million  decrease in interest expense net is mainly due to lower interest rates from refinancing our longterm debt during 2014 and 2015 and lower outstanding balances on notes payable 

we did not recognize impairment losses during 2015 during the year ended december 31 2014  we recognized a 11 million loss on the disposal of one operating property and one land parcel and a 175000 impairment on two parcels of land held 

during november 2015 we incurred an 82 million  charge from a makewhole premium on our 1000 million early redemption of the 4000 million outstanding 5875 senior unsecured notes that are due in 2017 

net investment income decreased 88 million  largely driven by an 81 million gain realized on the sale of availableforsale securities in 2014 and a 11  million decrease in the fair value of plan assets in the nonqualified deferred compensation plan during 2015 which is consistent with the change in plan liabilities included in general and administrative expenses above 

during the year ended december 31 2014  we acquired the remaining 50  interest and gained control of a previously unconsolidated investment in a real estate partnership that owns a single operating property as the operating property constitutes a business acquisition of control was accounted for as a step acquisition and the net assets acquired were recognized at fair value the gain of 183 million  was recognized as the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the companys previously held equity interest using an income approach to measure fair value 

 39 

our equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships increased decreased as follows   



the 88 million  net decrease is largely attributed to 

grir    44 million  increase driven by 

 columbia i   18 million decrease from impairment loss upon the sale of one operating property during 2015  

columbia ii    424000 increase due to impairment losses recognized upon the sale of two properties during 2014  and 

other investments in real estate partnerships    114 million decrease within our other investment partnerships driven by the 109 million gains on the sale of two land parcels and two operating properties during 2014  

 40 

the following represents the remaining components that comprise net income attributable to the common stockholders and unit holders 



a 10 million tax benefit was recognized in 2014 upon the receipt of a state tax refund from amending our prior tax returns 

we recognized 356 million  of gains on the sale of real estate net of taxes in 2015  attributable to the sale of five  operating properties and two  land parcels as compared to 551 million of gains on the sale of real estate net of taxes in 2014 attributable to the sale of eleven operating properties and six land parcels 

income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased 10 million  due to to the 2014 acquisition of a portfolio held within a consolidated partnership coupled with new operating activity from a development beginning operations and a recent redevelopment completion within our consolidated partnerships

we earn fees at marketbased rates for asset management property management leasing acquisition and financing services that we provided to our coinvestment partnerships and third parties as follows   



asset and property management fees decreased due to the liquidation of one unconsolidated real estate partnership consisting of nine properties during the third quarter of 2013 

changes in our operating expenses are summarized in the following table   



  

depreciation and amortization increased as follows 

 

 

 

 

operating and maintenance costs increased as follows 

 

 

 

 

general and administrative expenses decreased approximately 10 million  largely due to greater capitalization of development overhead costs by 44 million stemming from higher volume of development projects offset by an increase of 46 million of higher incentive compensation expense during 2014 additionally changes in participant obligations within the deferred compensation plan resulted in a 19 million decrease in expense 

real estate taxes increased as follows 

  42 

 

 

 

the following table presents the components of other expense income 



our interest expense net increased 525000  mainly due to the 778 million of mortgage debt assumed with a portfolio acquisition in the first quarter of 2014 offset by additional capitalized interest on development projects 

during 2014  we recognized a 11 million of loss on the disposal of one operating property and one land parcel and a 175000 impairment on two parcels of land held during the year ended december 31 2013  we recognized a 60 million  impairment on a single operating property 

net investment income increased 62 million  largely driven by an 81 million gain realized on the sale of availableforsale securities offset by a 19 million decrease in net investment income from the deferred compensation plan relating to the change in the fair value of plan assets 

during 2014  we acquired the remaining 50 interest and gained control of a previously unconsolidated investment in a real estate partnership that owns a single operating property as the operating property constitutes a business acquisition of control was accounted for as a step acquisition and the net assets acquired were recognized at fair value the gain of 183 million  was recognized as the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the companys previously held equity interest using an income approach to measure fair value 

 43 

our equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships decreased increased as follows

we recognized a gain on sale of real estate of 551 million  during 2014  from the sale of eleven operating properties compared to 580 million  during 2013  from the sale of twelve operating properties 

  

supplemental earnings information 

we use certain nongaap performance measures in addition to the required gaap presentations as we believe these measures are beneficial to us in improving the understanding of the companys operational results among the investing public we believe such measures make comparisons of other reits operating results to the companys more meaningful we continually evaluate the usefulness relevance and calculation of our reported nongaap performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public and thus such reported measures could change

the following table summarizes net cash flows related to operating investing and financing activities of the company   



net cash provided by operating activities  

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 21 million  during 2015  as compared to 2014  due to 

 we operate our business such that we expect net cash provided by operating activities will provide the necessary funds to pay our distributions to our common and preferred stock and unit holders which were 2028 million  and 1940 million  for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively our dividend distribution policy is set by our board of directors who monitors our financial position our board of directors recently declared our common stock quarterly dividend of 0500  per share payable on march 3 2016  future dividends will be declared at the discretion of our board of directors and will be subject to capital requirements and availability we plan to continue paying an aggregate amount of distributions to our stock and unit holders that at a minimum meet the requirements to continue qualifying as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

  

 47 

net cash used in investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities decreased by 709 million  primarily due to a decrease in shopping center acquisitions and development expenditures during 2015 



  

significant investing and divesting activities included 

 

 

 

 

 

we plan to continue developing and redeveloping shopping centers for longterm investment purposes we deployed capital of 2051 million  for the development redevelopment and improvement of our real estate properties as comprised of the following 

 48 

  

 

 

 currently in process we intend to continuously improve our portfolio of shopping centers through 

redevelopment which can include adjacent land acquisition existing building expansion new outparcel 

building construction and tenant improvement costs the size and scope of each redevelopment project 

varies with each redevelopment plan 

 

 

we have a staff of employees who directly support our development and redevelopment program internal compensation costs directly attributable to these activities are capitalized as part of each project as summarized in the table above changes in the level of future development and redevelopment activity could adversely impact results of operations by reducing the amount of internal costs for development and redevelopment projects that may be capitalized a 10 reduction in development and redevelopment activity without a corresponding reduction in the compensation costs directly related to our development and redevelopment activities could result in an additional charge to net income of 14 million per year 

as of december 31 2015  and 2014  we had seven  development projects that were either under construction or in lease up the following table summarizes our development projects 



1 includes leasing costs and is net of tenant reimbursements

net cash used in financing activities  

  

net cash flows used in financing activities increased by 1789 million  during 2015  primarily from debt repayments net of proceeds from debt and equity issuances as follows 



significant financing activities during the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  include 

 

 

 

 

 

we endeavor to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets as of december 31 2015  803 of our whollyowned real estate assets were unencumbered such assets allow us to access the secured and unsecured debt markets and to maintain availability on the line our coverage ratio including our prorata share of our partnerships was 28 and 25 times for the trailing four quarters ended december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  respectively we define our coverage ratio as earnings before interest taxes investment transaction profits net of deal costs depreciation and amortization “core ebitda” 

 50 

divided by the sum of the gross interest and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders 

through the end of 2016  we estimate that we will require approximately 1987 million of cash including 1262 million to complete inprocess developments and redevelopments 414 million to repay maturing debt and 311 million to fund our prorata share of estimated capital contributions to our coinvestment partnerships for repayment of debt if we start new developments or redevelop additional shopping centers our cash requirements will increase if we refinance maturing debt our cash requirements will decrease to meet our cash requirements we may utilize cash generated from operations proceeds from the sale of real estate available borrowings from our line and when the capital markets are favorable proceeds from the sale of equity and the issuance of new longterm debt 

we continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt to repay maturing debt or fund 

our commitments based upon the current capital markets our current credit ratings and the number of high quality 

unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings we currently expect that we will successfully issue 

new secured or unsecured debt to fund our obligations as needed 

we have 3000 million of fixed rate unsecured debt maturing june 15 2017 we expect to issue new fixed rate unsecured debt in 2017 in order to mitigate the risk of interest rate volatility we previously entered into 2200 million of forward starting interest rate swaps to partially hedge the new longterm debt issued in 2017 these interest rate swaps lock in the 10year treasury rate and swap spread at a weighted average fixed rate of 348 respectively a current market based credit spread applicable to regency will be added to the locked in fixed rate at time of issuance that will determine the final bond yield we will cash settle these forward starting interest rate swaps when we issue the new debt the actual cash settlement may differ from the current fair value of these interest rate swaps based on movements in interest rates 

our line term loan and unsecured loans require that we remain in compliance with various covenants which are 

described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements we are in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2015  and expect to remain in compliance 

contractual obligations 

we have debt obligations related to our mortgage loans unsecured notes unsecured credit facilities and interest rate swap obligations as described further below and in note 9 and note 10 to the consolidated financial statements we have shopping centers that are subject to noncancelable longterm ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to us to construct andor operate a shopping center in addition we have noncancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from which we conduct our business 

the following table of contractual obligations summarizes our debt maturities including our prorata share of obligations within coinvestment partnerships as of december 31 2015  and excludes the following 

 

 

 

  51 

  

1  includes interest payments 

2  we are obligated to contribute our prorata share to fund maturities if they are not refinanced we believe that our partners are financially sound and have sufficient capital or access thereto to fund future capital requirements in the event that a coinvestment partner was unable to fund its share of the capital requirements of the coinvestment partnership we would have the right but not the obligation to loan the defaulting partner the amount of its capital call   

critical accounting estimates 

knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial statements the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities as of a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period these accounting estimates are based upon but not limited to our judgments about historical and expected future results current market conditions and interpretation of industry accounting standards they are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness however the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates 

accounts receivable and straight line rent 

minimum rent percentage rent and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs insurance and real estate taxes are the companys principal source of revenue as a result of generating this revenue we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants we are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that may affect the collection of outstanding receivables to address the collectability of these receivables we analyze historical tenant collection rates writeoff experience tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts and straight line rent reserve although we estimate uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income actual experience may differ from those estimates 

real estate investments 

acquisition of real estate investments 

upon acquisition of real estate operating properties the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land building building improvements and tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and belowmarket leases and inplace leases assumed debt and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date based on these estimates the company allocates the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities fair value is determined based on an exit price approach which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date if up to one year from the acquisition date information regarding fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation on a retrospective basis the company expenses transaction costs associated with business combinations in the period incurred 

we strategically coinvest with partners to own manage acquire develop and redevelop operating properties we analyze our investments in real estate partnerships in order to determine whether the entity should be consolidated if it is determined that these investments do not require consolidation because the entities are not variable interest entities “vies” we are not considered the primary beneficiary of the entities determined to be vies we do not have voting control andor the limited partners or nonmanaging members have substantive participatory rights then the selection of the accounting method used to account for our investments in real estate partnerships is generally determined by our voting interests and the degree of influence we have over the entity management uses its judgment when making these determinations we use the equity method of accounting for investments in real estate partnerships when we own 20 or more of the voting interests and have significant influence but do not have a controlling financial interest or if we own less than 20 of the voting interests but have determined that we have significant influence under the equity method we record our investments in and advances to these entities as investments in real estate partnerships in our consolidated balance sheets and our proportionate share of earnings or losses earned by the joint venture is recognized in equity in income loss of investments in real estate partnerships in our consolidated statements of operations 

  

development of real estate assets and cost capitalization 

we capitalize the acquisition of land the construction of buildings and other specifically identifiable development costs incurred by recording them in properties in development in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets other specifically identifiable development costs include predevelopment costs essential to the development process as well as interest real estate taxes and direct employee costs incurred during the development period once a development property is substantially complete and held available for occupancy these indirect costs are no longer capitalized

we evaluate whether there are any indicators that have occurred including property operating performance and general market conditions that would result in us determining that the carrying value of our real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may not be recoverable if such indicators occur we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions including rental rates costs of tenant improvements leasing commissions anticipated hold period and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition including the exit capitalization rate these key assumptions are subjective in nature and the resulting impairment if any could differ from the actual gain or loss recognized upon ultimate sale in an arms length transaction if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the companys financial condition or operating performance 

we evaluate our investments in real estate partnerships for impairment whenever there are indicators including underlying property operating performance and general market conditions that the value of our investments in real estate partnerships may be impaired an investment in a real estate partnerships is considered impaired only if we determine that its fair value is less than the net carrying value of the investment in that real estate partnerships on an otherthantemporary basis cash flow projections for the investments consider property level factors such as expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other factors we consider various qualitative factors to determine if a decrease in the value of our investment is otherthantemporary these factors include the age of the real estate partnerships our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity the financial condition and longterm prospects of the entity and relationships with our partners and banks if we believe that the decline in the fair value of the investment is temporary no impairment charge is recorded if our analysis indicates that there is an otherthantemporary impairment related to the investment in a particular real estate partnership the carrying value of the investment will be adjusted to an amount that reflects the estimated fair value of the investment 

the fair value of real estate investments is subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization or the traditional discounted cash flow methods such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other factors and therefore are subject to management judgment and changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land we generally use market data and comparable sales information 

derivative instruments 

the company utilizes financial derivative instruments to manage risks associated with changing interest rates specifically the company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or future payment of known and uncertain cash amounts the amount of which are determined by interest rates the companys derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount timing and duration of the companys known or expected cash payments principally related to the companys borrowings for additional information on the company’s use and accounting for derivatives see notes 1 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

 53 

the company assesses effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at inception and on an ongoing basis the effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and our consolidated statement of equity our cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not perfectly match such as notional amounts settlement dates reset dates calculation period and libor rate if a cash flow hedge is deemed ineffective the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected 

the fair value of the companys interest rate derivatives is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives including the period to maturity and uses observable marketbased inputs including interest rate curves and implied volatilities the company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterpartys nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 to consolidated financial statements 

environmental matters 

we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers and underground petroleum storage tanks we believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations generally we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to more environmentally friendly systems where available we have applied and been accepted into statesponsored environmental programs we have a blanket environmental insurance policy for thirdparty liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination we have also placed environmental insurance where possible on specific properties with known contamination in order to mitigate our environmental risk we monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites we also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so 

as of december 31 2015  we had accrued liabilities of 91 million  for our prorata share of environmental remediation we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations however we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities that any previous owner occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants by the condition of nearby properties or by unrelated third parties or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have offbalance sheet arrangements financings or other relationships with other unconsolidated entities other than our unconsolidated investment partnerships or other persons also known as variable interest entities not previously discussed our unconsolidated investment partnership properties have been financed with nonrecourse loans we have no guarantees related to these loans 

inflationdeflation 

inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers however inflation may become a greater concern in the future substantially all of our longterm leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation most of our leases require tenants to pay their prorata share of operating expenses including commonarea maintenance real estate taxes insurance and utilities thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation in addition many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years which permits us to seek increased rents upon rerental at market rates however during deflationary periods or periods of economic weakness minimum rents and percentage rents will decline as the supply of available retail space exceeds demand and consumer spending declines occupancy declines resulting from a weak economic period will also likely result in lower recovery rates of our operating expenses

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to two significant components of interest rate risk 

 

 

we have 3000 million of fixed rate unsecured debt maturing in june 2017  in order to mitigate the risk of interest rate volatility we previously entered into 2200 million of forward starting interest rate swaps to partially hedge the new debt expected to be issued in 2017  these interest rate swaps lock in the 10year treasury rate and swap spread at a weighted average fixed rate of 348 a current market based credit spread applicable to regency will be added to the locked in fixed rate at time of issuance that will determine the final bond yield 

we continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt to repay maturing debt or fund our commitments based upon the current capital markets our current credit ratings our current capacity under our unsecured credit facilities and the number of high quality unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings we expect that we will be able to successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund these debt obligations 

our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the table below presents the principal cash flows weighted average interest rates of remaining debt and the fair value of total debt as of december 31 2015  dollars in thousands the table is presented by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes although the average interest rate for variable rate debt is included in the table those rates represent rates that existed as of december 31 2015  and are subject to change on a monthly basis further the table below incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2015  and does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date since firm commitments are not presented the table has limited predictive value as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at that time and actual interest rates

 item 1a risk factors 

risk factors related to our industry and real estate investments 

a shift in retail shopping from brick and mortar stores to internet sales may have an adverse impact on our revenues and cash flow 

many retailers operating brick and mortar stores have made internet sales a vital piece of their business although many of the retailers in our shopping centers either provide services or sell groceries such that their customer base does not have a tendency toward online shopping the shift to internet sales may adversely impact our retail tenants sales causing those retailers to adjust the size or number of retail locations in the future this shift could adversely impact our occupancy and rental rates which would impact our revenues and cash flows 

downturns in the retail industry likely will have a direct adverse impact on our revenues and cash flow 

our properties consist primarily of groceryanchored shopping centers our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space the market for retail space could be adversely affected by any of the following 

 

to the extent that any of these conditions occur they are likely to impact market rents for retail space occupancy in the operating portfolios our ability to sell acquire or develop properties and our cash available for distributions to stock and unit holders 

our revenues and cash flow could be adversely affected if economic or market conditions deteriorate where our properties are geographically concentrated which may impede our ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses and maintain our properties 

the economic conditions in markets in which our properties are concentrated greatly influence our financial performance during the year ended december 31 2014  our properties in california  florida  and texas  accounted for 306  113  and 100  respectively of our net operating income from consolidated properties plus our prorata share from unconsolidated properties prorata basis our revenues and cash available to pay expenses maintain our properties and for distributions to stock and unit holders could be adversely affected by this geographic concentration if market conditions such as supply of or demand for retail space deteriorate in california  florida  or texas  relative to other geographic areas 

our success depends on the success and continued presence of our “anchor” tenants 

anchor tenants occupy large amounts of square footage pay a significant portion of the total rents at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by drawing significant numbers of customers to a property     we derive significant revenues from anchor tenants such as kroger  publix  and safeway  who accounted for 45  38  and 23  respectively of our total annualized base rent on a prorata basis for the year ended december 31 2014  our net income could be adversely affected by the loss of revenues in the event a significant tenant 

  4 

some anchors have the right to vacate and prevent retenanting by paying rent for the balance of the lease term vacated anchor space including space owned by the anchor can reduce rental revenues generated by the shopping center because of the loss of the departed anchor tenants customer drawing power if a significant tenant vacates a property cotenancy clauses in select centers may allow other tenants to modify or terminate their rent or lease obligations cotenancy clauses have several variants they may allow a tenant to postpone a store opening if certain other tenants fail to open their stores they may allow a tenant to close its store prior to lease expiration if another tenant closes its store prior to lease expiration or more commonly they may allow a tenant to pay reduced levels of rent until a certain number of tenants open their stores within the same shopping center 

a significant percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller shop tenants and our net income could be adversely impacted if our smaller shop tenants are not successful 

a significant percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller shop tenants those occupying less than 10000 square feet smaller shop tenants may be more vulnerable to negative economic conditions as they have more limited resources than larger tenants such tenants continue to face increasing competition from nonstore retailers and growing ecommerce in addition some of these retailers may seek to reduce their store sizes as they increasingly rely on alternative distribution channels including internet sales and adjust their square footage needs accordingly the types of smaller shop tenants vary from retail shops to service providers if we are unable to attract the right type or mix of smaller shop tenants into our centers our net income could be adversely impacted 

we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy 

although minimum rent is supported by longterm lease contracts tenants who file bankruptcy have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and rejects its leases we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues and may not be able to collect all prepetition amounts owed by that party 

our real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges 

our longlived assets primarily real estate held for investment are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable we evaluate whether there are any indicators including property operating performance and general market conditions that the value of the real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may not be recoverable through the evaluation we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions including rental rates costs of tenant improvements leasing commissions anticipated holding periods and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition including the exit capitalization rate these key assumptions are subjective in nature and could differ materially from actual results changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the holding period of an asset or asset group which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the companys financial condition or operating performance to the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value 

the fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the traditional discounted cash flow approach such cash flow projections consider factors including expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other factors and therefore are subject to management judgment changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land we generally use market data and comparable sales information 

these subjective assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment charge results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income there can be no assurance that we will not take additional charges in the future related to the impairment of our assets any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our net income in the period in which the charge is taken 

adverse global market and economic conditions could cause us to recognize additional impairment charges or otherwise harm our performance 

we are unable to predict the timing severity and length of adverse market and economic conditions adverse market and economic conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flow to pay expenses maintain properties pay distributions to our stock and unit holders and refinance debt during adverse periods there may be significant uncertainty in the valuation of our properties and investments that could result in a substantial decrease in their value no 

 5 

assurance can be given that we would be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our properties and investments in the future our failure to do so would require us to recognize additional impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion which could materially and adversely affect us and the market price of our common stock 

unsuccessful development activities or a slowdown in development activities could have a direct impact on our revenues revenue growth andor net income 

we actively pursue development opportunities development activities require various government and other approvals for entitlements and any delay in such approvals may significantly delay the development process we may not recover our investment in development projects for which approvals are not received we incur other risks associated with development activities including 

 

our acquisition activities may not produce the returns that we expect 

our investment strategy includes investing in highquality shopping centers that are leased to marketdominant grocers categoryleading anchors specialty retailers or restaurants located in areas with high barriers to entry and above average household incomes and population densities the acquisition of properties andor companies entails risks that include but are not limited to the following any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

 

we may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or releasing space 

we derive most of our revenue from rent received from our tenants we are subject to the risks that upon expiration or termination of leases leases for space in our properties may not be renewed space may not be released or the terms of renewal or release including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable than current lease terms as a result our results of operations and our net income could be adversely impacted 

 6 

we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly our inability to respond promptly to unfavorable changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our stock and unit holders 

geographic concentration of our properties makes our business vulnerable to natural disasters and severe weather conditions which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and operating results 

a significant portion of our property gross leasable area is located in areas that are susceptible to earthquakes tropical storms hurricanes tornadoes wildfires and other natural disasters as of december 31 2014  approximately 236  150  and 105  of our property gross leasable area on a prorata basis was located in california  florida  and texas  respectively intense weather conditions during the last decade have caused our cost of property insurance to increase significantly we recognize that the frequency and  or intensity of extreme weather events may continue to increase due to climate change and as a result our exposure to these events could increase these weather conditions also disrupt our business and the business of our tenants which could affect the ability of some tenants to pay rent and may reduce the willingness of residents to remain in or move to the affected area therefore as a result of the geographic concentration of our properties we face risks including higher costs such as uninsured property losses and higher insurance premiums and disruptions to our business and the businesses of our tenants 

should we decide in the future to expand into new markets we may not be successful which could adversely affect our 

financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if opportunities arise we may explore acquisitions of properties in new markets each of the risks applicable to our 

ability to acquire and integrate successfully and operate properties in our current markets is also applicable in new markets in 

addition we may not possess the same level of familiarity with the dynamics and market conditions of the new markets we may 

enter which could adversely affect the results of our expansion into those markets and we may be unable to achieve our desired return on our investments in new markets if we are unsuccessful in expanding into new markets it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the insurance coverage on our properties could subject us to loss of capital or revenue on those properties 

we carry comprehensive liability fire flood extended coverage rental loss and environmental insurance for our properties with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties we believe that the insurance carried on our properties is adequate and consistent with industry standards there are however some types of losses such as losses from hurricanes terrorism wars or earthquakes for which the insurance levels carried may not be sufficient to fully cover catastrophic losses impacting multiple properties in addition tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons or damage to personal or real property on or off the premises due to activities conducted by tenants or their agents on the properties including without limitation any environmental contamination and at the tenants expense to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease liability and property damage insurance policies however our tenants may not properly maintain their insurance policies or have the ability to pay the deductibles associated with such policies should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from such properties which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition as well as our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders 

loss of our key personnel could adversely affect our business and operations 

we depend on the efforts of our key executive personnel although we believe qualified replacements could be found for our key executives the loss of their services could adversely affect our business and operations 

 7 

we face competition from numerous sources including other reits and other real estate owners 

the ownership of shopping centers is highly fragmented we face competition from other reits and well capitalized institutional investors as well as from numerous small owners in the acquisition ownership and leasing of shopping centers we also compete to develop shopping centers with other reits engaged in development activities as well as with local regional and national real estate developers this competition may 

• reduce the number of properties available for acquisition or development 

• increase the cost of properties available for acquisition or development 

• hinder our ability to attract and retain tenants leading to increased vacancy rates andor reduced rents and 

• adversely affect our ability to minimize our expenses of operation 

if we cannot successfully compete in our targeted markets our cash flow and therefore distributions to stock and unit holders may be adversely affected 

costs of environmental remediation could reduce our cash flow available for distribution to stock and unit holders 

under various federal state and local laws an owner or manager of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on the property these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances the cost of any required remediation could exceed the value of the property andor the aggregate assets of the owner or the responsible party the presence of or the failure to properly remediate hazardous or toxic substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a contaminated property or to use the property as collateral for a loan any of these developments could reduce cash flow and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders 

compliance with the americans with disabilities act and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures 

all of our properties are required to comply with the americans with disabilities act “ada” which generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities compliance with ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants or both while the tenants to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions and typically under tenant leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these tenants to cover costs could be adversely affected in addition we are required to operate the properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations as they may be adopted by governmental entities and become applicable to the properties we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with these requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our financial obligations and make distributions to our stock and unit holders 

if we do not maintain the security of tenantrelated information we could incur substantial costs and become subject to litigation 

we have implemented an online payment system where we receive certain information about our tenants that depends upon secure transmissions of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments a compromise of our security systems that results in information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties in addition a security breach could require us to expend significant resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage our business and disruptions in both our primary and secondary backup systems could harm our ability to run our business 

although we have independent redundant and physically separate primary and secondary computer systems it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our businesscritical computer systems our computer systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees if our computer systems and our backup systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any 

 8 

material interruption in both of our computer systems and backup systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

risk factors related to our coinvestment partnerships and acquisition structure 

we do not have voting control over our joint venture investments so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued 

we have invested substantial capital as a partner in a number of joint venture investments for the acquisition or development of properties these investments involve risks not present in a whollyowned project as we do not have voting control over the ventures although we do have approval rights over major decisions the other partner may i have interests or goals that are inconsistent with our interests or goals or ii otherwise impede our objectives the other partner also may become insolvent or bankrupt these factors could limit the return that we receive from such investments or cause our cash flows to be lower than our estimates 

the termination of our coinvestment partnerships could adversely affect our cash flow operating results and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders 

if coinvestment partnerships owning a significant number of properties were dissolved for any reason we would lose the asset and property management fees from these coinvestment partnerships which could adversely affect our operating results and our cash available for distribution to stock and unit holders 

risk factors related to funding strategies and capital structure 

higher market capitalization rates for our properties could adversely impact our ability to sell properties and fund developments and acquisitions and could dilute earnings 

as part of our funding strategy we sell operating properties that no longer meet our investment standards or those with a limited future growth profile these sales proceeds are used to fund the construction of new developments redevelopments and acquisitions an increase in market capitalization rates could cause a reduction in the value of centers identified for sale which would have an adverse impact on the amount of cash generated in order to meet the cash requirements of our development program we may be required to sell more properties than initially planned which could have a negative impact on our earnings 

we depend on external sources of capital which may not be available in the future on favorable terms or at all 

to qualify as a reit the parent company must among other things distribute to its stockholders each year at least 90 of its reit taxable income excluding any net capital gains because of these distribution requirements we may not be able to fund all future capital needs with income from operations we therefore will have to rely on thirdparty sources of capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all our access to thirdparty sources of capital depends on a number of things including the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings our access to debt depends on our credit rating the willingness of creditors to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets in addition to finding creditors willing to lend to us we are dependent upon our joint venture partners to contribute their pro rata share of any amount needed to repay or refinance existing debt when lenders reduce the amount of debt our joint ventures are eligible to refinance 

  in addition our existing debt arrangements also impose covenants that limit our flexibility in obtaining other financing such as a prohibition on negative pledge agreements additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders interests and additional debt financing may substantially increase our degree of leverage 

without access to external sources of capital we would be required to pay outstanding debt with our operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales our operating cash flows may not be sufficient to pay our outstanding debt as it comes due and real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly at a return we believe is appropriate if we are required to deleverage our business with operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales we may be forced to reduce the amount of or eliminate altogether our distributions to stock and unit holders or refrain from making investments in our business 

 9 

our debt financing may adversely affect our business and financial condition 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance which to a certain extent is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control in addition we do not expect to generate sufficient funds from operations to make balloon principal payments on our debt when due if we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms we may be forced i to dispose of properties which might result in losses or ii to obtain financing at unfavorable terms either of which could reduce the cash flow available for distributions to stock and unit holders if we cannot make required mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose on the property securing the mortgage 

covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition 

our unsecured notes unsecured term loan and unsecured line of credit contain customary covenants including compliance with financial ratios such as ratio of total debt to gross asset value and fixed charge coverage ratio fixed charge coverage ratio is defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda divided by the sum of interest expense and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders our debt arrangements also restrict our ability to enter into a transaction that would result in a change of control these covenants may limit our operational flexibility and our acquisition activities moreover if we breach any of the covenants in our debt agreements and do not cure the breach within the applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately even in the absence of a payment default many of our debt arrangements including our unsecured notes unsecured term loan and unsecured line of credit are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other material debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our stock 

increases in interest rates would cause our borrowing costs to rise and negatively impact our results of operations 

  

although a significant amount of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates we do borrow funds at variable interest rates under our credit facilities increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense on any variable rate debt to the extent we have not hedged our exposure to changes in interest rates in addition increases in interest rates will affect the terms under which we refinance our existing debt as it matures to the extent we have not hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates this would reduce our future earnings and cash flows which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our stock and unit holders 

we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through taxdeferred contribution transactions which could result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell such assets 

we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for 

partnership interests in our operating partnership which may result in stockholder dilution this acquisition structure may have 

the effect of among other things reducing the amount of tax depreciation we could deduct over the tax life of the acquired 

properties and may require that we agree to protect the contributors’ ability to defer recognition of taxable gain through 

restrictions on our ability to dispose of the acquired properties andor the allocation of partnership debt to the contributors to 

maintain their tax bases these restrictions could limit our ability to sell an asset at a time or on terms that would be favorable 

absent such restrictions 

hedging activity may expose us to risks including the risks that a counterparty will not perform and that the hedge will 

not yield the economic benefits we anticipate which could adversely affect us 

from time to time we manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements that 

involve risk such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements and that these 

arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes there can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will qualify for hedge accounting or that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations should we desire to terminate a hedging agreement there could be significant costs and cash requirements involved to fulfill our obligations under the hedging agreement failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations 

 10 

risk factors related to the market price for our debt and equity securities 

changes in economic and market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our securities 

the market price of our debt and equity securities may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors many of which are out of our control including 

 

these factors may cause the market price of our securities to decline regardless of our financial condition results of operations business or prospects it is impossible to ensure that the market price of our securities including our common stock will not fall in the future a decrease in the market price of our common stock could reduce our ability to raise additional equity in the public markets selling common stock at a decreased market price would have a dilutive impact on existing stockholders 

we cannot assure you we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates 

our ability to continue to pay dividends at historical rates or to increase our dividend rate will depend on a number of factors including among others the following 

  

 

if we do not maintain or periodically increase the dividend on our common stock it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and other securities 

changes in accounting standards may adversely impact our financial results 

the financial accounting standards board fasb in conjunction with the sec has several key projects on their agenda that could impact how we currently account for our material transactions including lease accounting and other convergence projects with the international accounting standards board at this time we are unable to predict with certainty which if any proposals may be passed or what level of impact any such proposal could have on the presentation of our consolidated financial statements our results of operations and our financial ratios required by our debt covenants 

  

risk factors related to federal income tax laws 

if the parent company fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes it would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 

we believe that the parent company qualifies for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes and we plan to operate so that we can continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit if the parent company continues to qualify as a reit it generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders many reit requirements however are highly technical and complex the determination that the parent company is a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances some of which may not be totally within our control and some of which 

 11 

involve questions of interpretation for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income must come from specific passive sources like rent that are itemized in the reit tax laws there can be no assurance that the internal revenue service “irs” or a court would agree with the positions we have taken in interpreting the reit requirements we are also required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains the fact that we hold many of our assets through coinvestment partnerships and their subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements furthermore congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult or impossible for the parent company to remain qualified as a reit 

also unless the irs granted relief under certain statutory provisions the parent company would remain disqualified as a reit for four years following the year it first failed to qualify if the parent company failed to qualify as a reit currently andor with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired we would have to pay significant income taxes reducing cash available to pay dividends which would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to pay any dividends to stockholders although we believe that the parent company qualifies as a reit we cannot assure you that the parent company will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes 

even if the parent company qualifies as a reit for federal income tax purposes we are required to pay certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from “prohibited transactions” that income will be subject to a 100 tax in general prohibited transactions include sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business the determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale while we have undertaken a significant number of asset sales in recent years we do not believe that those sales should be considered prohibited transactions but there can be no assurance that the irs would not contend otherwise 

dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates 

subject to limited exceptions dividends paid by reits other than distributions designated as capital gain dividends or returns of capital are not eligible for reduced rates for qualified dividends paid by c corporations and are taxable at ordinary income tax rates the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals trusts and estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could adversely affect the value of the shares of reits including the shares of our capital stock 

foreign stockholders may be subject to us federal income tax on gain recognized on a disposition of our common stock if we do not qualify as a domestically controlled reit 

a foreign person disposing of a us real property interest including shares of a us corporation whose assets consist principally of us real property interests is generally subject to us federal income tax on any gain recognized on the disposition this tax does not apply however to the disposition of stock in a reit if the reit is domestically controlled in general we will be a domestically controlled reit if at all times during the fiveyear period ending on the applicable stockholder’s disposition of our stock less than 50 in value of our stock was held directly or indirectly by nonus persons if we were to fail to qualify as a domestically controlled reit gain recognized by a foreign stockholder on a disposition of our common stock would be subject to us federal income tax unless our common stock was traded on an established securities market and the foreign stockholder did not at any time during a specified testing period directly or indirectly own more than 5 of our outstanding common stock 

complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities 

the reit provisions of the code limit our ability to hedge our liabilities generally income from a hedging transaction we enter into either to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings incurred or to be incurred to acquire or carry real estate assets or to manage the risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain or any property which generates such income or gain that constitutes “qualifying income” for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests applicable to reits does not constitute “gross income” for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests provided that we properly identify the hedging transaction pursuant to the applicable sections of the code and treasury regulations to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions or fail to make the proper tax identifications the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests as a result of these rules we may need to limit our use of otherwise advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a taxable reit subsidiary or trs the use of a trs could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our trs would be subject to tax on income or gain resulting from hedges entered into by it or expose us to greater risks than we would otherwise want to bear in addition net losses in a trs will generally not provide any tax benefit except for being carried forward for use against future taxable income in the trs 

 12 

risk factors related to our ownership limitations and the florida business corporation act 

restrictions on the ownership of the parent companys capital stock to preserve its reit status could delay or prevent a change in control 

ownership of more than 7 by value of our outstanding capital stock is prohibited with certain exceptions by the parent companys articles of incorporation for the purpose of maintaining its qualification as a reit this 7 limitation may discourage a change in control and may also i deter tender offers for our capital stock which offers may be attractive to our stockholders or ii limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their capital stock that might otherwise exist if an investor attempted to assemble a block in excess of 7 of our outstanding capital stock or to affect a change in control 

the issuance of the parent companys capital stock could delay or prevent a change in control 

the parent companys articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to 30000000 shares of preferred stock and 10000000 shares of special common stock and to establish the preferences and rights of any shares issued the issuance of preferred stock or special common stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control the provisions of the florida business corporation act regarding control share acquisitions and affiliated transactions could also deter potential acquisitions by preventing the acquiring party from voting the common stock it acquires or consummating a merger or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of our disinterested stockholders

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

regency centers corporation began its operations as a reit in 1993 and is the managing general partner of regency centers lp all of our operating investing and financing activities are performed through the operating partnership its whollyowned subsidiaries and through its coinvestment partnerships as of december 31 2014  the parent company owned approximately 998  of the outstanding common partnership units of the operating partnership 

as of december 31 2014  we directly owned 202  consolidated properties located in 21  states representing 232 million  square feet of gla through coinvestment partnerships we own partial ownership interests in 120  unconsolidated properties located in 23  states and the district of columbia representing 150 million  square feet of gla 

we earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to grocery stores major retail anchors restaurants sideshop retailers and service providers as well as ground leasing or selling outparcels to these same types of tenants we experience growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates in our existing shopping centers and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers 

we grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions of operating centers and new shopping center development we will continue to use our development capabilities market presence and anchor relationships to invest in valueadded new developments and redevelopments of existing centers we fund our acquisition and development activity from various capital sources including operating cash flow property sales equity offerings new financing and coinvestment real estate partnerships coinvestment real estate partnerships provide us with an additional capital source for shopping center acquisitions developments and redevelopments as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset management property management and other investing and financing services 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial statements the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities as of a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period these accounting estimates are based upon but not limited to our judgments about historical and expected future results current market conditions and interpretation of industry accounting standards they are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness however the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates 

accounts receivable and straight line rent 

minimum rent percentage rent and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs insurance and real estate taxes are the companys principal source of revenue as a result of generating this revenue we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants we are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that may affect the collection of outstanding receivables to address the collectability of these receivables we analyze historical writeoff experience tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts and straight line rent reserve although we estimate uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income actual experience may differ from those estimates

real estate investments 

acquisition of real estate investments 

upon acquisition of real estate operating properties the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land building building improvements and tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and belowmarket leases and inplace leases assumed debt and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date based on these estimates the company allocates the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities fair value is determined based on an exit price approach which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date if up to one year from the acquisition date information regarding fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation on a retrospective basis the company expenses transaction costs associated with business combinations in the period incurred 

we strategically coinvest with partners to own manage acquire develop and redevelop operating properties we analyze our investments in real estate partnerships in order to determine whether the entity should be consolidated if it is determined that these investments do not require consolidation because the entities are not variable interest entities “vies” we are not considered the primary beneficiary of the entities determined to be vies we do not have voting control andor the limited partners or nonmanaging members have substantive participatory rights then the selection of the accounting method used to account for our investments in real estate partnerships is generally determined by our voting interests and the degree of influence we have over the entity management uses its judgment when making these determinations we use the equity method of accounting for investments in real estate partnerships when we own 20 or more of the voting interests and have significant influence but do not have a controlling financial interest or if we own less than 20 of the voting interests but have determined that we have significant influence under the equity method we record our investments in and advances to these entities as investments in real estate partnerships in our consolidated balance sheets and our proportionate share of earnings or losses earned by the joint venture is recognized in equity in income loss of investments in real estate partnerships in our consolidated statements of operations 

  

development of real estate assets and cost capitalization 

we capitalize the acquisition of land the construction of buildings and other specifically identifiable development costs incurred by recording them in properties in development in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets other specifically identifiable development costs include predevelopment costs essential to the development process as well as interest real estate taxes and direct employee costs incurred during the development period once a development property is substantially complete and held available for occupancy these indirect costs are no longer capitalized 

 

valuation of real estate investments 

we evaluate whether there are any indicators that have occurred including property operating performance and general market conditions that would result in us determining that the carrying value of our real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may not be recoverable if such indicators occur we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate 

 44 

disposition of the asset our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions including rental rates costs of tenant improvements leasing commissions anticipated hold period and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition including the exit capitalization rate these key assumptions are subjective in nature and the resulting impairment if any could differ from the actual gain or loss recognized upon ultimate sale in an arms length transaction if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the companys financial condition or operating performance 

we evaluate our investments in real estate partnerships for impairment whenever there are indicators including underlying property operating performance and general market conditions that the value of our investments in real estate partnerships may be impaired an investment in a real estate partnerships is considered impaired only if we determine that its fair value is less than the net carrying value of the investment in that real estate partnerships on an otherthantemporary basis cash flow projections for the investments consider property level factors such as expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other factors we consider various qualitative factors to determine if a decrease in the value of our investment is otherthantemporary these factors include the age of the real estate partnerships our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity the financial condition and longterm prospects of the entity and relationships with our partners and banks if we believe that the decline in the fair value of the investment is temporary no impairment charge is recorded if our analysis indicates that there is an otherthantemporary impairment related to the investment in a particular real estate partnership the carrying value of the investment will be adjusted to an amount that reflects the estimated fair value of the investment 

the fair value of real estate investments is subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization or the traditional discounted cash flow methods such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other factors and therefore are subject to management judgment and changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land we generally use market data and comparable sales information 

derivative instruments 

the company utilizes financial derivative instruments to manage risks associated with changing interest rates specifically the company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or future payment of known and uncertain cash amounts the amount of which are determined by interest rates the companys derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount timing and duration of the companys known or expected cash payments principally related to the companys borrowings for additional information on the company’s use and accounting for derivatives see notes 1 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

the company assesses effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at inception and on an ongoing basis the effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and our consolidated statement of equity our cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not perfectly match such as notional amounts settlement dates reset dates calculation period and libor rate if a cash flow hedge is deemed ineffective the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected

1  net of tenant concessions 

the following table summarizes prorata occupancy rates of our combined consolidated and unconsolidated shopping center portfolio 



  

leasing activity was strong in 2014  with prorata occupancy gains of 70 basis points driven primarily by new leasing in the less than 10000 sqft category but also supported by high renewal activity of expiring leases in both categories as summarized in the leasing activity table below and lower than historical moveout rates we believe our highquality grocery anchored shopping centers located in densely populated desirable infill trade areas create attractive spaces for retail tenants improvements in the economy combined with historically low levels of new supply and robust tenant demand allow us to focus on merchandising of our centers to ensure the right mix of operators and unique retailers which draws more retail customers to our centers

the following table summarizes leasing activity for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  including our prorata share of activity within the portfolio of our coinvestment partnerships 





1 number of leasing transactions reported at 100 all other statistics reported at prorata share 

2 totals for base rent tenant improvements and leasing commissions reflect the weighted average per square foot psf 

in the greater than or equal to 10000 sqft category base rent psf on new leases remained constant in 2014 in the under 10000 sqft category for both new new leases and renewals base rent psf continued to increase on leases executed in 2014 

significant tenants and concentrations of risk 

we seek to reduce our operating and leasing risks through geographic diversification and by avoiding dependence on any single property market or tenant the following table summarizes our three most significant tenants each of which is a grocery tenant occupying our shopping centers at december 31 2014    



1  includes stores owned by grocery anchors that are attached to our centers

in january 2015 safeway inc and ab acquisition llc albertsons completed their proposed merger announced in march 2014 in addition to the centers anchored by safeway above we have 12 shopping centers anchored by albertsons representing 14 of company owned gla and 10 of annualized base rent on a prorata basis the federal trade commission ftc is requiring that they divest 168 stores of these six are in our shopping centers and are under contract to be purchased by haggen 

bankruptcies 

although base rent is supported by longterm lease contracts tenants who file bankruptcy may have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues we monitor the operating performance and rent collections of all tenants in our shopping centers especially those tenants operating retail formats that are experiencing significant changes in competition business practice and store closings in other locations we are not currently aware of the pending bankruptcy or announced store closings of any tenants in our shopping centers that would individually cause a material reduction in our revenues and no tenant represents more than 5 of our annual base rent on a prorata basis 

our management team devotes significant time to monitoring consumer preferences shopping behaviors and demographics to anticipate both challenges and opportunities in the changing retail industry that may affect our tenants as a result of our findings we may reduce new leasing suspend leasing or curtail the allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements within a certain retail category or to a specific retailer

net cash provided by operating activities  

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 270 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to the year ended december 31 2013  due to 

 we operate our business such that we expect net cash provided by operating activities will provide the necessary funds to pay our distributions to our common and preferred stock and unit holders which were 1940 million  and 1892 million  for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively our dividend distribution policy is set by our board of directors who monitor our financial position our board of directors recently declared our common stock quarterly dividend of 0485  per share payable on march 5 2015  future dividends will be declared at the discretion of our board of directors and will be subject to capital requirements and availability we plan to continue paying an aggregate amount of distributions to our stock and unit holders that at a minimum meet the requirements to continue qualifying as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

net cash used in investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities increased by 2005 million  due to lower real estate dispositions during 2014  within our consolidated and unconsolidated portfolio coupled with a slight increase in acquisitions and development activity which were funded from sales proceeds and financing activity 



  

significant investing and divesting activities included

 52 

significant financing activities during the year ended december 31 2014  include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we endeavor to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets as of december 31 2014  768 of our whollyowned real estate assets were unencumbered such assets allow us to access the secured and unsecured debt markets and to maintain significant availability on the line our coverage ratio including our prorata share of our partnerships was 25 times for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to 24 times for the year ended december 31 2013  we define our coverage ratio as earnings before interest taxes investment transaction profits net of deal costs depreciation and amortization “core ebitda” divided by the sum of the gross interest and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders 

through 2015  we estimate that we will require approximately 6227 million of cash including 1792 million to complete inprocess developments and redevelopments 4262 million to repay maturing debt and approximately 173 to fund our prorata share of estimated capital contributions to our coinvestment partnerships for repayment of debt if we start new developments or redevelop additional shopping centers our cash requirements will increase if we refinance maturing debt our cash requirements will decrease to meet our cash requirements we will utilize cash generated from operations borrowings from our line and term loan proceeds from the sale of real estate cash receipts from our forward equity offering and when the capital markets are favorable proceeds from the sale of equity and the issuance of debt 

we have 3500 million of fixed rate unsecured debt maturing in august 2015 and 4000 million of fixed rate unsecured debt maturing in june 2017 in order to mitigate the risk of interest rate volatility we previously entered into 2200 million of forward starting interest rate swaps to partially hedge the new debt expected to be issued in 2015 and an additional 2200 million of forward starting interest rate swaps to partially hedge the new debt expected to be issued in 2017 these interest rate swaps lock in the 10year treasury rate and swap spread at a weighted average fixed rate of 267 and 348 respectively a current market based credit spread applicable to regency will be added to the locked in fixed rate at time of issuance that will determine the final bond yield we will cash settle these forward starting interest rate swaps when we issue the new debt the actual cash settlement may differ from the current fair value of these interest rate swaps based on movements in interest rates 

we continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt to repay maturing debt or fund our commitments based upon the current capital markets our current credit ratings and the number of high quality unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings we currently expect that we will successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund our obligations as needed 

our line term loan and unsecured loans require we remain in compliance with various covenants which are described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements we are in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2014  and expect to remain in compliance

asset and property management fees decreased due to the liquidation of one unconsolidated real estate partnership consisting of nine properties during the third quarter of 2013 partially offset by higher asset and property management fees from our other partnerships 

 56 

  

our operating expenses increased in 2014  as compared to 2013  as summarized in the following table in thousands

operating and maintenance increased 68 million  the increase relates to the following 20 million from acquisitions 26 million from new development operations and 24 million at same property driven by an increase in snow removal costs offset by approximately 200000 from sold properties 

general and administrative expenses decreased approximately 10 million  largely due to greater capitalization of development overhead costs by 44 million stemming from higher volume of development projects offset by an increase of 46 million of higher incentive compensation expense during 2014 additionally changes in participant obligations within the deferred compensation plan resulted in a 19 million decrease in expense 

real estate taxes increased 53 million  the increase largely consists of the following 26 million from acquisitions 16 million from new development operations and 14 million at same properties from higher assessed values partially offset by approximately 300000 from sold properties

net investment income increased 62 million  largely driven by an 81 million gain realized on the sale of available for sale securities offset by a 19 million decrease in net investment income from deferred compensation plan related to the change in the fair value of plan assets 

during the year ended december 31 2014  we acquired the remaining 50  interest and gained control of a previously unconsolidated investment in real estate partnership that owns a single operating property as the operating property constitutes a business acquisition of control was accounted for as a step acquisition and the net assets acquired were recognized at fair value the gain of 183 million  was recognized as the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the companys previously held equity interest using an income approach to measure fair value 

 57 

the following table presents the change in net interest expense in thousands   



  

our total interest expense increased mainly due to the 778 million of mortgage debt assumed with the fairfield portfolio acquisition in the first quarter of 2014 

our equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships increased in 2014  as compared to 2013  as follows in thousands

we earned fees at marketbased rates for asset management property management leasing acquisition disposition and financing services that we provided to our coinvestment partnerships and third parties as follows in thousands   



asset and property management fees decreased approximately 815000 due to the liquidation of two unconsolidated real estate partnerships during 2013 resulting in 11 million reduction in asset and property management fees partially offset by higher asset and property management fees from our other partnerships leasing commissions and other fees decreased during 2013 as compared to 2012 due to the two liquidations discussed above and a decrease in leasing activities performed for coinvestment partnerships and third parties during 2013 as occupancy levels stabilize and less vacant gla was available for lease 

our operating expenses increased as summarized in the following table in thousands   



  

depreciation and amortization increased 116 million  the increase is largely attributable to the following 83 million from acquisitions 65 million at same properties and 47 million from new development operations offset by 75 million decrease from the sale of a 15 property portfolio in july 2012 not considered discontinued operations

 60 

the following table presents the components of other expense income in thousands 



see table below for a discussion of interest expense 

during the year ended december 31 2013  we recognized a 60 million impairment on a single operating property during the year ended december 31 2012  we recognized total impairments of 203 million including 181 million related to the 15property portfolio sold in july 2012 and 22 million related to three land parcels 

 during 2013 we repaid two mortgages early with minimal remaining unamortized loan costs on july 20 2012 we repaid 1500 million of our term loan and as a result of this early extinguishment of debt we expensed approximately 852000 in remaining unamortized loan costs 

the 12 million  increase in net investment income from deferred compensation plan related to the change in the fair value of plan assets from december 31 2012  to december 31 2013  and is consistent with the change in plan liabilities included in general and administrative expenses above 

the following table presents the change in interest expense in thousands

the decrease in income tax expense of taxable reit subsidiary is due to the large expense recognized during 2012 as a full valuation allowance was established on the balance of our deferred tax assets 

income from discontinued operations of 653 million for the year ended december 31 2013 included 580 million in gains net of taxes from the sale of twelve properties and the operations of the shopping centers sold loss from discontinued operations of 217 million for the year ended december 31 2012 included the operations of the shopping centers sold during 2012 and 2013 and 219 million in gains net of taxes from the sale of five properties offset by 545 million of impairment losses

supplemental earnings information 

we use certain nongaap performance measures in addition to the required gaap presentations as we believe these measures are beneficial to us in improving the understanding of our operational results among the investing public we believe such measures make comparisons of other reits operating results to ours more meaningful we continually evaluate the usefulness relevance and calculation of our reported nongaap performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public and thus such reported measures could change 

the following are our definitions of same property net operating income noi funds from operations ffo and core ffo which we believe to be beneficial nongaap performance measures used in understanding our operational results

 66 

environmental matters 

we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers and underground petroleum storage tanks we believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations generally we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to more environmentally friendly systems where available we have applied and been accepted into statesponsored environmental programs we have a blanket environmental insurance policy for thirdparty liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination we have also placed environmental insurance where possible on specific properties with known contamination in order to mitigate our environmental risk we monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites we also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so 

as of december 31 2014  we had accrued liabilities of 102 million  for our prorata share of environmental remediation we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations however we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities that any previous owner occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants by the condition of nearby properties or by unrelated third parties or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us 

inflationdeflation 

inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers however inflation may become a greater concern in the future substantially all of our longterm leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation most of our leases require tenants to pay their prorata share of operating expenses including commonarea maintenance real estate taxes insurance and utilities thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation in addition many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years which permits us to seek increased rents upon rerental at market rates however during deflationary periods or periods of economic weakness minimum rents and percentage rents will decline as the supply of available retail space exceeds demand and consumer spending declines occupancy declines resulting from a weak economic period will also likely result in lower recovery rates of our operating expenses 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

we are exposed to two significant components of interest rate risk 

 

 

we have 3500 million  and 4000 million  of fixed rate unsecured debt maturing in august 2015  and june 2017  respectively in order to mitigate the risk of interest rate volatility we previously entered into 2200 million of forward starting interest rate swaps to partially hedge the new debt expected to be issued in 2015  and an additional 2200 million of forward starting interest rate swaps to partially hedge the new debt expected to be issued in 2017  these interest rate swaps lock in the 10year treasury rate and swap spread at a weighted average fixed rate of 267 

 67 

and 348 respectively a current market based credit spread applicable to regency will be added to the locked in fixed rate at time of issuance that will determine the final bond yield 

we continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt to repay maturing debt or fund our commitments based upon the current capital markets our current credit ratings our current capacity under our unsecured credit facilities and the number of high quality unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings we expect that we will be able to successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund these debt obligations 

our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the table below presents the principal cash flows weighted average interest rates of remaining debt and the fair value of total debt as of december 31 2014  dollars in thousands the table is presented by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes although the average interest rate for variable rate debt is included in the table those rates represent rates that existed as of december 31 2014  and are subject to change on a monthly basis further the table below incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2014  and does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date since firm commitments are not presented the table has limited predictive value as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at that time and actual interest rates

 item 1 business 

regency centers corporation began its operations as a reit in 1993 and is the managing general partner of regency centers lp we endeavor to be a preeminent bestinclass groceryanchored shopping center company distinguished by total shareholder return and per share growth in core funds from operations core ffo and net asset value nav that positions regency as a leader among its peers we work to achieve these goals through 

 

all of our operating investing and financing activities are performed through the operating partnership its whollyowned subsidiaries and through its coinvestment partnerships the parent company currently owns approximately 998  of the outstanding common partnership units of the operating partnership 

  

as of december 31 2013  we directly owned 202  shopping centers the “consolidated properties” located in 23  states representing 225 million  square feet of gross leasable area “gla” through coinvestment partnerships we own partial ownership interests in 126  shopping centers the “unconsolidated properties” located in 23  states and the district of columbia representing 155 million  square feet of gla 

we earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to grocery stores major retail anchors restaurants sideshop retailers and service providers as well as ground leasing or selling building pads outparcels to these same types of tenants we experience growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates in our existing shopping centers and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers as of december 31 2013  our consolidated properties were 945  leased as compared to 941  as of december 31 2012  

we grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions of operating centers and new shopping center development we will continue to use our development capabilities market presence and anchor relationships to invest in valueadded new developments and redevelopments of existing centers development is customer driven meaning we generally have an executed lease from the anchor before we start construction development serves the growth needs of our anchors and retailers resulting in high quality shopping centers with longterm anchor leases that produce attractive returns on our invested capital this development process typically requires two to three years once construction has commenced but can vary subject to the size and complexity of the project we fund our acquisition and development activity from various capital sources including operating cash flows property sales equity offerings and new debt 

coinvestment partnerships provide us with an additional capital source for shopping center acquisitions developments and redevelopments as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset management property management and other investing and financing services as an asset manager we are engaged by our partners to apply similar operating investment and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the coinvestment partnerships as those applied to the portfolio that we whollyown

we recognize the importance of continually improving the environmental sustainability performance of our real estate assets to date we have received leed leadership in energy and environmental design certifications by the us green building council at seven  shopping centers and have leed certification targeted at six  additional development properties inprocess or recently completed we also continue to implement best practices in our operating portfolio to reduce our power and water consumption in addition to other sustainability initiatives we believe that the design construction and operation of environmentally efficient shopping centers will contribute to our key strategic goals 

competition 

  

we are among the largest owners of shopping centers in the nation based on revenues number of properties gla and market capitalization there are numerous companies and individuals engaged in the ownership development acquisition and operation of shopping centers that compete with us in our targeted markets including grocery store chains that also anchor some of our shopping centers this results in competition for attracting anchor tenants as well as the acquisition of existing shopping centers and new development sites we believe that our competitive advantages are driven by 

   

employees 

  

our headquarters are located at one independent drive suite 114 jacksonville florida we presently maintain 17 market offices nationwide where we conduct management leasing construction and investment activities as of december 31 2013  we had 363 employees and we believe that our relations with our employees are good 

  compliance with governmental regulations 

  

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate certain hazardous or toxic substances at our shopping centers these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances the cost of required remediation and the owners liability for remediation could exceed the value of the property andor the aggregate assets of the owner the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral while we have a number of properties that could require or are currently undergoing varying levels of environmental remediation known environmental remediation is not currently expected to have a material financial impact on us due to existing accrued liabilities for remediation insurance programs designed to mitigate the cost of remediation and various stateregulated programs that shift the responsibility and cost to the state

 item 1a risk factors 

risk factors related to our industry and real estate investments 

a shift in retail shopping from brick and mortar stores to internet sales may have an adverse impact on our revenues and cash flow 

many retailers operating brick and mortar stores have made internet sales a vital piece of their business although many of the retailers in our shopping centers either provide services or sell groceries such that their customer base does not have a tendency toward online shopping the shift to internet sales may adversely impact our retail tenants sales causing those retailers to adjust the size or number of retail locations in the future this shift could adversely impact our occupancy and rental rates which would impact our revenues and cash flows 

downturns in the retail industry likely will have a direct adverse impact on our revenues and cash flow 

our properties consist primarily of groceryanchored shopping centers our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space the market for retail space could be adversely affected by any of the following 

 

to the extent that any of these conditions occur they are likely to impact market rents for retail space occupancy in the operating portfolios our ability to sell acquire or develop properties and our cash available for distributions to stock and unit holders 

our revenues and cash flow could be adversely affected by poor economic or market conditions where our properties are geographically concentrated which may impede our ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses and maintain our properties 

the economic conditions in markets in which our properties are concentrated greatly influence our financial performance during the year ended december 31 2013  our properties in california  florida  and texas  accounted for 312  114  and 98  respectively of our net operating income from consolidated properties plus our prorata share from unconsolidated properties prorata basis our revenues and cash available to pay expenses maintain our properties and for distributions to stock and unit holders could be adversely affected by this geographic concentration if market conditions such as supply of or demand for retail space deteriorate in california  florida  or texas  relative to other geographic areas 

loss of revenues from significant tenants could reduce distributions to stock and unit holders 

we derive significant revenues from anchor tenants such as kroger  publix  and safeway  as of december 31 2013 they account for 47  43  and 27  respectively of our total annualized base rent on a prorata basis which is recognized in minimum rent and in equity in income of investment in real estate partnerships for the year ended december 31 2013  distributions to stock and unit holders could be adversely affected by the loss of revenues in the event a significant tenant 

 

 4 

vacated anchor space including space owned by the anchor can reduce rental revenues generated by the shopping center because of the loss of the departed anchor tenants customer drawing power some anchors have the right to vacate and prevent retenanting by paying rent for the balance of the lease term if significant tenants vacate a property then other tenants may be entitled to terminate their leases at the property or pay reduced rent 

our net income depends on the success and continued occupancy of our tenants 

our net income could be adversely affected in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of any of our anchors or a significant number of our nonanchor tenants within a shopping center or if we fail to lease significant portions of our new developments the adverse impact on our net income may be greater than the loss of rent from the resulting unoccupied space because cotenancy clauses in select centers may allow other tenants to modify or terminate their rent or lease obligations cotenancy clauses have several variants they may allow a tenant to postpone a store opening if certain other tenants fail to open their stores they may allow a tenant to close its store prior to lease expiration if another tenant closes its store prior to lease expiration or more commonly they may allow a tenant to pay reduced levels of rent until a certain number of tenants open their stores within the same shopping center 

a large percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller shop tenants and our net income could be adversely impacted if our smaller shop tenants are not successful 

a large percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller shop tenants those occupying less than 10000 square feet smaller shop tenants may be more vulnerable to negative economic conditions as they have more limited resources than larger tenants such tenants continue to face increasing competition from nonstore retailers and growing ecommerce in addition some of these retailers may seek to reduce their store sizes as they increasingly rely on alternative distribution channels including internet sales and adjust their square footage needs accordingly the types of smaller shop tenants vary from retail shops to service providers if we are unable to attract the right type or mix of smaller shop tenants into our centers our net income could be adversely impacted 

we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy 

although minimum rent is supported by longterm lease contracts tenants who file bankruptcy have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and rejects its leases we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues and may not be able to collect all prepetition amounts owed by that party 

our real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges 

our longlived assets primarily real estate held for investment are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable we evaluate whether there are any indicators including property operating performance and general market conditions that the value of the real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may not be recoverable through the evaluation we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions including rental rates costs of tenant improvements leasing commissions anticipated hold periods and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition including the exit capitalization rate these key assumptions are subjective in nature and could differ materially from actual results changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the companys financial condition or operating performance to the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value 

the fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the traditional discounted cash flow approach such cash flow projections consider factors including expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other factors and therefore are subject to management judgment changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land we generally use market data and comparable sales information 

these subjective assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment charge results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income there can be no assurance that we will not take additional charges in the future related to the impairment of our assets any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our net income in the period in which the charge is taken 

 5 

adverse global market and economic conditions may adversely affect us and could cause us to recognize additional impairment charges or otherwise harm our performance 

we are unable to predict the timing severity and length of adverse market and economic conditions adverse market and economic conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flow to pay expenses maintain properties pay distributions to our stock and unit holders and refinance debt during adverse periods there may be significant uncertainty in the valuation of our properties and investments that could result in a substantial decrease in their value no assurance can be given that we would be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our properties and investments in the future our failure to do so would require us to recognize additional impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion which could materially and adversely affect us and the market price of our common stock 

our acquisition activities may not produce the returns that we expect 

our investment strategy includes investing in highquality shopping centers that are leased to marketdominant grocers categoryleading anchors specialty retailers or restaurants located in areas with high barriers to entry and above average household incomes and population densities the acquisition of properties entails risks that include but are not limited to the following any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

 

unsuccessful development activities or a slowdown in development activities could have a direct impact on our revenues and our revenue growth 

we actively pursue development activities as opportunities arise development activities require various government and other approvals for entitlements and any delay in such approvals may significantly delay the development process we may not recover our investment in development projects for which approvals are not received we incur other risks associated with development activities including 

 

if our developments are unsuccessful or we experience a slowdown in development activities our revenue growth andor net income may be adversely impacted 

we may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or releasing space 

we derive most of our revenue directly or indirectly from rent received from our tenants we are subject to the risks that upon expiration or termination of leases leases for space in our properties may not be renewed space may not be re 

 6 

leased or the terms of renewal or release including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable than current lease terms as a result our results of operations and our net income could be adversely impacted 

we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly our inability to respond promptly to unfavorable changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our stock and unit holders 

geographic concentration of our properties makes our business vulnerable to natural disasters and severe weather conditions which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and operating results 

a significant portion of our property gross leasable area is located in areas that are susceptible to earthquakes tropical storms hurricanes tornadoes wildfires and other natural disasters as of december 31 2013  approximately 234  159  and 98  of our property gross leasable area on a prorata basis was located in california  florida  and texas  respectively intense weather conditions during the last decade have caused our cost of property insurance to increase significantly while much of this insurance cost is passed on to our tenants as reimbursable property costs some tenants do not pay a pro rata share of these costs under their leases these weather conditions also disrupt our business and the business of our tenants which could affect the ability of some tenants to pay rent and may reduce the willingness of residents to remain in or move to the affected area therefore as a result of the geographic concentration of our properties we face demonstrable risks including higher costs such as uninsured property losses and higher insurance premiums and disruptions to our business and the businesses of our tenants 

an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the insurance policies on our properties could subject us to loss of capital or revenue on those properties 

we carry comprehensive liability fire flood extended coverage rental loss and environmental insurance for our properties with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties we believe that the insurance carried on our properties is adequate and consistent with industry standards there are however some types of losses such as from hurricanes terrorism wars or earthquakes for which the insurance levels carried may not be sufficient to fully cover catastrophic losses impacting multiple properties in addition tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons or damage to personal or real property on or off the premises due to activities conducted by tenants or their agents on the properties including without limitation any environmental contamination and at the tenants expense to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease liability and property damage insurance policies however our tenants may not properly maintain their insurance policies or have the ability to pay the deductibles associated with such policies should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from such properties which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition as well as our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders 

loss of our key personnel could adversely affect the value of our parent companys stock price 

we depend on the efforts of our key executive personnel although we believe qualified replacements could be found for our key executives the loss of their services could adversely affect our parent companys stock price 

we face competition from numerous sources including other real estate investment trusts and other real estate owners 

the ownership of shopping centers is highly fragmented we face competition from other real estate investment trusts and well capitalized institutional investors as well as from numerous small owners in the acquisition ownership and leasing of shopping centers we compete to develop shopping centers with other real estate investment trusts engaged in development activities as well as with local regional and national real estate developers if we cannot successfully compete in our targeted markets our cash flow and therefore distributions to stock and unit holders may be adversely affected 

costs of environmental remediation could reduce our cash flow available for distribution to stock and unit holders 

under various federal state and local laws an owner or manager of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on the property these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances the cost of any required remediation could exceed the value of the property andor the aggregate assets of the owner or the responsible party the presence of or the failure to properly remediate hazardous or toxic substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a 

 7 

contaminated property or to borrow using the property as collateral any of these developments could reduce cash flow and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders 

compliance with the americans with disabilities act and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that adversely affect our cash flows 

all of our properties are required to comply with the americans with disabilities act “ada” the ada has separate compliance requirements for “public accommodations” and “commercial facilities” but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants or both while the tenants to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions and typically under tenant leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these tenants to cover costs could be adversely affected in addition we are required to operate the properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations as they may be adopted by governmental entities and become applicable to the properties we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with these requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our financial obligations and make distributions to our stock and unit holders 

if we do not maintain the security of tenantrelated information we could incur substantial costs and become subject to litigation 

we have implemented an online payment system where we receive certain information about our tenants that depends upon secure transmissions of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments a compromise of our security systems that results in information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties in addition a security breach could require that we expend significant resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage our business disruptions in both our primary and secondary backup systems could harm our ability to run our business 

although we have independent redundant and physically separate primary and secondary computer systems it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our businesscritical computer systems our computer systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees if our computer systems and our backup systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in both of our computer systems and backup systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

risk factors related to our coinvestment partnerships and acquisition structure 

we do not have voting control over our joint venture investments so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued 

we have invested as a partner in a number of joint venture investments for the acquisition or development of properties these investments involve risks not present in a whollyowned project we do not have voting control over the ventures although we do have approval rights over major decisions the other partner might i have interests or goals that are inconsistent with our interests or goals or ii otherwise impede our objectives the other partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt these factors could limit the return that we receive from such investments or cause our cash flows to be lower than our estimates 

the termination of our coinvestment partnerships could adversely affect our cash flow operating results and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders 

if coinvestment partnerships owning a significant number of properties were dissolved for any reason we would lose the asset and property management fees from these coinvestment partnerships which could adversely affect our operating results and our cash available for distribution to stock and unit holders 

 8 

risk factors related to funding strategies and capital structure 

higher market capitalization rates for our properties could adversely impact our ability to sell properties and fund developments and acquisitions and could dilute earnings 

as part of our funding strategy we sell operating properties that no longer meet our investment standards these sales proceeds are used to fund the construction of new developments redevelopments and acquisitions an increase in market capitalization rates could cause a reduction in the value of centers identified for sale which would have an adverse impact on the amount of cash generated in order to meet the cash requirements of our development program we may be required to sell more properties than initially planned which could have a negative impact on our earnings 

we depend on external sources of capital which may not be available in the future on favorable terms or at all 

to qualify as a reit the parent company must among other things distribute to its stockholders each year at least 90 of its reit taxable income excluding any net capital gains because of these distribution requirements we may not be able to fund all future capital needs including capital for developments and repayment of future maturing debt with income from operations we therefore will have to rely on thirdparty sources of capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all our access to thirdparty sources of capital depends on a number of things including the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings our access to debt depends on our credit rating the willingness of creditors to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets in addition to finding creditors willing to lend to us we are dependent upon our joint venture partners to contribute their share of any amount needed to repay or refinance existing debt when lenders reduce the amount of debt our joint ventures are eligible to refinance 

  in addition our existing debt arrangements also impose covenants that limit our flexibility in obtaining other financing such as a prohibition on negative pledge agreements additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders interests and additional debt financing may substantially increase our degree of leverage 

without access to external sources of capital we would be required to pay outstanding debt with our operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales our operating cash flows may not be sufficient to pay our outstanding debt as it comes due and real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly at a return we believe is appropriate if we are required to deleverage our business with operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales we may be forced to reduce the amount of or eliminate altogether our distributions to stock and unit holders or refrain from making investments in our business 

our debt financing may adversely affect our business and financial condition 

our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance which to a certain extent is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control in addition we do not expect to generate sufficient funds from operations to make balloon principal payments on our debt when due if we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms we might be forced i to dispose of properties which might result in losses or ii to obtain financing at unfavorable terms either could reduce the cash flow available for distributions to stock and unit holders if we cannot make required mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose on the property securing the mortgage causing the loss of cash flow from that property 

covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition 

our unsecured notes unsecured term loan and unsecured line of credit contain customary covenants including compliance with financial ratios such as ratio of total debt to gross asset value and fixed charge coverage ratio fixed charge coverage ratio is defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda divided by the sum of interest expense and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders our debt arrangements also restrict our ability to enter into a transaction that would result in a change of control these covenants may limit our operational flexibility and our acquisition activities moreover if we breach any of the covenants in our debt agreements and do not cure the breach within the applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately even in the absence of a payment default many of our debt arrangements including our unsecured notes unsecured term loan and unsecured line of credit are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other material debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our stock 

 9 

increases in interest rates would cause our borrowing costs to rise and negatively impact our results of operations 

  

although a significant amount of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates we do borrow funds at variable interest rates under our credit facilities increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense on any variable rate debt in addition increases in interest rates will affect the terms under which we refinance our existing debt as it matures this would reduce our future earnings and cash flows which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our stock and unit holders 

risk factors related to interest rates and the market price for our stock 

changes in economic and market conditions could adversely affect the parent companys stock price 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors many of which are out of our control including 

 

these factors may cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of our financial condition results of operations business or prospects it is impossible to ensure that the market price of our common stock will not fall in the future a decrease in the market price of our common stock could reduce our ability to raise additional equity in the public markets selling common stock at a decreased market price would have a dilutive impact on existing stockholders 

we cannot assure you we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates 

our ability to continue to pay dividends to stock and unit holders at historical rates or to increase our dividend rate will depend on a number of factors including among others the following 

  

 

if we do not maintain or periodically increase the dividend on our common stock it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and other securities 

changes in accounting standards may adversely impact our financial results 

the financial accounting standards board fasb in conjunction with the sec has several key projects on their agenda that could impact how we currently account for our material transactions including lease accounting and other convergence projects with the international accounting standards board at this time we are unable to predict with certainty which if any proposals may be passed or what level of impact any such proposal could have on the presentation of our consolidated financial statements our results of operations and our financial ratios required by our debt covenants

risk factors related to federal income tax laws 

if the parent company fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes it would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 

we believe that we qualify for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes and we plan to operate so that we can continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit if we continue to qualify as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on our income that we distribute to our stockholders many reit requirements however are highly technical and complex the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances some of which may not be totally within our control and some of which involve questions of interpretation for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income must come from specific passive sources like rent that are itemized in the reit tax laws there can be no assurance that the internal revenue service “irs” or a court would agree with the positions we have taken in interpreting the reit requirements we are also required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains the fact that we hold many of our assets through coinvestment partnerships and their subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements furthermore congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult or impossible for us to remain qualified as a reit 

also unless the irs granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we would remain disqualified as a reit for four years following the year we first failed to qualify if we failed to qualify as a reit currently andor with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired we would have to pay significant income taxes reducing cash available to pay dividends which would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to pay any dividends to stockholders although we believe that we qualify as a reit we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes 

even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we are required to pay certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from “prohibited transactions” that income will be subject to a 100 tax in general prohibited transactions include sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business the determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale while we have undertaken a significant number of asset sales in recent years we do not believe that those sales should be considered prohibited transactions but there can be no assurance that the irs would not contend otherwise 

dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates 

in general the maximum us federal income tax rate for “qualified dividends” paid by regular “c” corporations to us shareholders that are individuals trusts and estates after december 31 2012 is 20 and a new medicare tax of 38 may also apply if income is greater than certain specified amounts subject to limited exceptions dividends paid by reits other than distributions designated as capital gain dividends or returns of capital are not eligible for these reduced rates and are taxable at ordinary income tax rates the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals trusts and estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could adversely affect the value of the shares of reits including the shares of our capital stock 

foreign stockholders may be subject to us federal income tax on gain recognized on a disposition of our common stock if we do not qualify as a domestically controlled reit 

a foreign person disposing of a us real property interest including shares of a us corporation whose assets consist principally of us real property interests is generally subject to us federal income tax on any gain recognized on the disposition this tax does not apply however to the disposition of stock in a reit if the reit is domestically controlled in general we will be a domestically controlled reit if at all times during the fiveyear period ending on the applicable stockholder’s disposition of our stock less than 50 in value of our stock was held directly or indirectly by nonus persons if we were to fail to qualify as a domestically controlled reit gain recognized by a foreign stockholder on a disposition of our common stock would be subject to us federal income tax unless our common stock was traded on an established securities market and the foreign stockholder did not at any time during a specified testing period directly or indirectly own more than 5 of our outstanding common stock 

 11 

risk factors related to our ownership limitations and the florida business corporation act 

restrictions on the ownership of the parent companys capital stock to preserve our reit status could delay or prevent a change in control 

ownership of more than 7 by value of our outstanding capital stock is prohibited with certain exceptions by our articles of incorporation for the purpose of maintaining our qualification as a reit this 7 limitation may discourage a change in control and may also i deter tender offers for our capital stock which offers may be attractive to our stockholders or ii limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their capital stock that might otherwise exist if an investor attempted to assemble a block in excess of 7 of our outstanding capital stock or to affect a change in control 

the issuance of the parent companys capital stock could delay or prevent a change in control 

our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to 30000000 shares of preferred stock and 10000000 shares of special common stock and to establish the preferences and rights of any shares issued the issuance of preferred stock or special common stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control the provisions of the florida business corporation act regarding control share acquisitions and affiliated transactions could also deter potential acquisitions by preventing the acquiring party from voting the common stock it acquires or consummating a merger or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of our disinterested stockholders

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

regency centers corporation began its operations as a reit in 1993 and is the managing general partner of regency centers lp we endeavor to be a preeminent bestinclass groceryanchored shopping center company distinguished by total shareholder return and per share growth in core ffo and nav that positions regency as a leader among its peers we work to achieve these goals through 

 

all of our operating investing and financing activities are performed through the operating partnership its whollyowned subsidiaries and through its coinvestment partnerships as of december 31 2013 the parent company owned approximately 998  of the outstanding common partnership units of the operating partnership 

as of december 31 2013  we directly owned 202  consolidated properties located in 23  states representing 225 million  square feet of gla through coinvestment partnerships we own partial ownership interests in 126  unconsolidated properties located in 23  states and the district of columbia representing 155 million  square feet of gla 

we earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to grocery stores major retail anchors restaurants sideshop retailers and service providers as well as ground leasing or selling outparcels to these same types of tenants we experience growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates in our existing shopping centers and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers as of december 31 2013  our consolidated properties were 945  leased as compared to 941  as of december 31 2012  

we grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions of operating centers and new shopping center development we will continue to use our development capabilities market presence and anchor relationships to invest in valueadded new developments and redevelopments of existing centers development is customer driven meaning we generally have an executed lease from the anchor before we start construction development serves the growth needs of our anchors and retailers resulting in highquality shopping centers with longterm anchor leases that produce attractive returns on our invested capital this development process typically requires two to three years once construction has commenced but can vary subject to the size and complexity of the project we fund our acquisition and development activity from various capital sources including property sales equity offerings and new debt 

coinvestment partnerships provide us with an additional capital source for shopping center acquisitions developments and redevelopments as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset management property management and other investing and financing services as an asset manager we are engaged by our partners to apply similar operating investment and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the coinvestment partnerships as those applied to the portfolio that we whollyown 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial statements the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities as of a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period these accounting estimates are based upon but not limited to our judgments about historical and expected future results current market conditions and interpretation of industry accounting standards they are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness however the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates 

 40 

accounts receivable and straight line rent 

minimum rent percentage rent and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs insurance and real estate taxes are the companys principal source of revenue as a result of generating this revenue we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants we are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that may affect the collection of outstanding receivables to address the collectability of these receivables we analyze historical writeoff experience tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts and straight line rent reserve although we estimate uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income actual experience may differ from those estimates 

real estate investments 

acquisition of real estate investments 

upon acquisition of real estate operating properties the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land building building improvements and tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and belowmarket leases and inplace leases assumed debt and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date based on these estimates the company allocates the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities fair value is determined based on an exit price approach which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date if up to one year from the acquisition date information regarding fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation on a retrospective basis the company expenses transaction costs associated with business combinations in the period incurred 

we strategically coinvest with partners to own manage acquire develop and redevelop operating properties we analyze our investments in real estate partnerships in order to determine whether the entity should be consolidated if it is determined that these investments do not require consolidation because the entities are not variable interest entities “vies” we are not considered the primary beneficiary of the entities determined to be vies we do not have voting control andor the limited partners or nonmanaging members have substantive participatory rights then the selection of the accounting method used to account for our investments in real estate partnerships is generally determined by our voting interests and the degree of influence we have over the entity management uses its judgment when making these determinations we use the equity method of accounting for investments in real estate partnerships when we own 20 or more of the voting interests and have significant influence but do not have a controlling financial interest or if we own less than 20 of the voting interests but have determined that we have significant influence under the equity method we record our investments in and advances to these entities as investments in real estate partnerships in our consolidated balance sheets and our proportionate share of earnings or losses earned by the joint venture is recognized in equity in income loss of investments in real estate partnerships in our consolidated statements of operations 

  

development of real estate assets and cost capitalization 

we capitalize the acquisition of land the construction of buildings and other specifically identifiable development costs incurred by recording them in properties in development in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets other specifically identifiable development costs include predevelopment costs essential to the development process as well as interest real estate taxes and direct employee costs incurred during the development period once a development property is substantially complete and held available for occupancy these indirect costs are no longer capitalized 

  41 

2011  we capitalized 117 million 103 million and 55 million respectively of direct internal costs incurred to support our development program the capitalization of costs is directly related to the actual level of development activity occurring 

valuation of real estate investments 

we evaluate whether there are any indicators that have occurred including property operating performance and general market conditions that would result in us determining that the carrying value of our real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may not be recoverable if such indicators occur we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions including rental rates costs of tenant improvements leasing commissions anticipated hold period and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition including the exit capitalization rate these key assumptions are subjective in nature and the resulting impairment if any could differ from the actual gain or loss recognized upon ultimate sale in an arms length transaction if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the companys financial condition or operating performance 

we evaluate our investments in real estate partnerships for impairment whenever there are indicators including underlying property operating performance and general market conditions that the value of our investments in real estate partnerships may be impaired an investment in a real estate partnerships is considered impaired only if we determine that its fair value is less than the net carrying value of the investment in that real estate partnerships on an otherthantemporary basis cash flow projections for the investments consider property level factors such as expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other factors we consider various qualitative factors to determine if a decrease in the value of our investment is otherthantemporary these factors include the age of the real estate partnerships our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity the financial condition and longterm prospects of the entity and relationships with our partners and banks if we believe that the decline in the fair value of the investment is temporary no impairment charge is recorded if our analysis indicates that there is an otherthantemporary impairment related to the investment in a particular real estate partnership the carrying value of the investment will be adjusted to an amount that reflects the estimated fair value of the investment 

the fair value of real estate investments is subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization or the traditional discounted cash flow methods such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other factors and therefore are subject to management judgment and changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land we generally use market data and comparable sales information 

derivative instruments 

the company utilizes financial derivative instruments primarily to manage risks associated with changing interest rates specifically the company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or future payment of known and uncertain cash amounts the amount of which are determined by interest rates the companys derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount timing and duration of the companys known or expected cash payments principally related to the companys borrowings for additional information on the company’s use and accounting for derivatives see notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

the company assess effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at inception and on an ongoing basis the effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and our consolidated statement of equity our cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not perfectly match such as notional amounts settlement dates reset dates calculation period and libor rate if a cash flow hedge is deemed ineffective the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected 

the fair value of the companys interest rate derivatives is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives including the period to maturity and uses observable marketbased inputs including interest rate curves and implied volatilities the company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterpartys nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements

we seek to reduce our operating and leasing risks through geographic diversification avoiding dependence on any single property market or tenant and owning a portion of our shopping centers through coinvestment partnerships the following table summarizes our three most significant tenants each of which is a grocery tenant occupying our shopping centers at december 31 2013

2  includes our prorata share of unconsolidated properties and excludes those owned by anchors 

3 kroger information includes harris teeter stores as their merger was effective january 28 2014 

on january 28 2014 the kroger co kroger completed its merger with harris teeter supermarkets inc although krogers acquisition of harris teeter is expected to expand its presence in the southeastern united states there is a possibility that kroger may identify stores in which it has a presence in the same local market as harris teeter which could result in store closures we currently have nine stores leased by harris teeter which represents 11 of company owned gla and 07 of annualized base rent on a prorata basis 

in october 2013 safeway inc announced that it intends by early 2014 to exit the chicago market where it operated 72 dominicks stores safeway has been marketing the chain for sale or sublease we had seven store leases with dominick’s of which one was already operating under a sublease agreement and four have been acquired by other national grocery stores the remaining two stores were closed for business in late december 2013 and represent approximately 02 of company owned gla and 01 of annualized base rent on a prorata basis safeway will continue to pay contractual rent through the end of their lease terms while they continue to market the spaces for assignment or sublease 

although base rent is supported by longterm lease contracts tenants who file bankruptcy may have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues we monitor the operating performance and rent collections of all tenants in our shopping centers especially those tenants operating retail formats that are experiencing significant changes in competition business practice and store closings in other locations we also evaluate consumer preferences shopping behaviors and demographics to anticipate both challenges and opportunities in the changing retail industry that may affect our tenants as a result of our findings we may reduce new leasing suspend leasing or curtail the allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements within a certain retail category or to a specific retailer we are not currently aware of the pending bankruptcy or announced store closings of any tenants in our shopping centers that would individually cause a material reduction in our revenues as of december 31 2013 no tenant represents more than 5 of our annual base rent on a prorata basis

liquidity and capital resources 

our parent company has no capital commitments other than its guarantees of the commitments of our operating partnership the parent company will from time to time access the capital markets for the purpose of issuing new equity and will simultaneously contribute all of the offering proceeds to the operating partnership in exchange for additional partnership units all debt is issued by our operating partnership or by our coinvestment partnerships the following table represents the remaining available capacity under our at the market atm equity program and our unsecured line of credit commitment the line as of december 31 2013  in thousands 



the following table summarizes net cash flows related to operating investing and financing activities of the company for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  in thousands   



net cash provided by operating activities  

net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 65 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to the year ended december 31 2012  due to the timing of cash receipts and payments we operate our business such that we expect net cash provided by operating activities will provide the necessary funds to pay our distributions to our common and preferred stock and unit holders included in net cash used in financing activities above which were 1892 million  and 1884 million  for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively our dividend distribution policy is set by our board of directors who monitor our financial position our board of directors recently declared our common stock quarterly dividend of 0470  per share payable on march 6 2014  a 0075 increase over our previous quarterly dividend rate future dividends will be declared at the discretion of our board of directors and will be subject to capital requirements and availability we plan to continue paying an aggregate amount of distributions to our stock and unit holders that at a minimum meet the requirements to continue qualifying as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

net cash used in provided by investing activities  

net cash flows from investing activities changed by 134 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to the year ended december 31 2012  due primarily to increased capital expenditures on development projects during 2013 and less proceeds from the sale of shopping centers in 2013 

significant investing activities during the year ended december 31 2013  included 

 

  45 

subsequent distribution of proceeds and proceeds from sales of properties and debt refinancing within the partnerships these proceeds were offset by additional investments of 109 million  primarily for mortgage maturities and acquisitions 

 

 

   

 

 

  46 

as of december 31 2013  we had six  development projects that were either under construction or in lease up compared to four such development projects as of december 31 2012  the following table summarizes our development projects as of december 31 2013  in thousands except cost per sft 



1 amount represents costs including leasing costs net of tenant reimbursements 

2 amount represents a weighted average 

the following table summarizes our development projects completed during the year ended december 31 2013  in thousands except cost per sft 



1  includes leasing costs net of tenant reimbursements 

we plan to continue developing and redeveloping projects for longterm investment purposes and have a staff of employees who directly support our development and redevelopment program internal costs attributable to these development and redevelopment activities are capitalized as part of each project during the year ended december 31 2013  we capitalized 61 million  of interest expense and 117 million  of internal costs for salaries and related benefits for development and redevelopment activity changes in the level of future development and redevelopment activity could adversely impact results of operations by reducing the amount of internal costs for development and redevelopment projects that may be capitalized a 10 reduction in development and redevelopment activity without a corresponding reduction in the compensation costs directly related to our development and redevelopment activities could result in an additional charge to net income of approximately 12 million 

net cash used in financing activities  

  

net cash used in financing activities decreased by 673 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to the year ended december 31 2012  primarily related to the additional proceeds received from common stock issuances in 2013  significant financing activities during the year ended december 31 2013  include 

 

 

 

we endeavor to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets as of december 31 2013  773 of our whollyowned real estate assets were unencumbered such assets allow us to access the secured and unsecured debt markets and to maintain significant availability on the line our coverage ratio including our prorata share of our partnerships was 24 times for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to 25 times for the year ended december 31 2012  we define our 

 47 

coverage ratio as earnings before interest taxes investment transaction profits net of deal costs depreciation and amortization “core ebitda” divided by the sum of the gross interest and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders 

through 2014  we estimate that we will require approximately 3665 million including 1825 million to complete current inprocess developments and redevelopments 1658 million for repayment of debt and approximately 182 to fund our prorata share of estimated capital contributions to our coinvestment partnerships for repayment of debt if we start new developments or redevelop additional shopping centers our cash requirements will increase as of december 31 2013  our joint ventures had 671 million  of scheduled secured mortgage loans and credit lines maturing through 2014  to meet our cash requirements we will utilize cash generated from operations borrowings from our line proceeds from the sale of real estate and when the capital markets are favorable proceeds from the sale of common equity and the issuance of debt our line term loan and unsecured loans require we remain in compliance with various covenants which are described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements we are in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2013 and expect to remain in compliance 

we continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt to repay maturing debt or fund our commitments based upon the current capital markets our current credit ratings and the number of high quality unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings we expect that we will successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund our obligations 

we have 1500 million  and 3500 million  of fixed rate unsecured debt maturing in april 2014  and august 2015  respectively as the economy improves long term interest rates may continue to increase in order to mitigate the risk of interest rate volatility we entered into 3950 million  of forward starting interest rate swaps for new debt issues occurring through august 1 2016 these interest rate swaps lock in the 10year treasury rate and swap spread at a weighted average fixed rate of 245  these rates are exclusive of our credit spread at the time of debt issuance

our revenues increased in 2013  as compared to 2012  as summarized in the following table in thousands

recoveries from tenants and other income represent reimbursements from tenants for their prorata share of the operating maintenance and real estate tax expenses that we incur to operate our shopping centers as well as other income earned at our operating properties recoveries from tenants increased during 2013  as compared to 2012  due to the following 

 

 

 

 

we earned fees at marketbased rates for asset management property management leasing acquisition and financing services that we provided to our coinvestment partnerships and third parties as follows in thousands   

  

  

asset and property management fees decreased approximately 815000  due to the liquidation of two unconsolidated real estate partnerships during 2013 resulting in a 11 million reduction in asset and property management fees partially offset by higher asset and property management fees from our other partnerships leasing commissions and other fees decreased 

 50 

during 2013  as compared to 2012  due to the two liquidations discussed above and a decrease in leasing activity performed for coinvestment partnerships and third parties during 2013  as occupancy levels stabilize and less vacant gla was available for lease 

our operating expenses increased in 2013  as compared to 2012  as summarized in the following table in thousands   



depreciation and amortization operating and maintenance expenses and real estate taxes increased due the impact of acquisitions development operations and dispositions during 2013  and 2012  as follows 

 

 

 

in addition general and administrative expenses decreased approximately 466000  primarily due to greater capitalization of development overhead costs of approximately 14 million due to higher volume of development projects offset by a decrease in capitalization of leasing overhead costs of 12 million as occupancy levels stabilize and less vacant gla was available to be leased the net change in compensation and other overhead costs resulted in additional savings of approximately 200000 

the following table presents the components of other expense income in thousands 



see table below for a discussion of interest expense

the 12 million  increase in net investment income from deferred compensation plan related to the change in the fair value of plan assets from december 31 2012  to december 31 2013  and is consistent with the change in plan liabilities included in general and administrative expenses above 

 51

 54 

the following table presents the components of other expense income in thousands 



see table below for a discussion of interest expense 

as discussed above we sold a 15property portfolio on july 25 2012 and as a result of this sale we recognized a net impairment loss of 181 million during the year ended december 31 2012  we also recognized 22 million of impairment losses during 2012  related to three land parcels during the year ended december 31 2011  we recognized a 125 million  provision for impairment related to two operating properties that exhibited weak operating fundamentals including low economic occupancy for an extended period of time

loss from discontinued operations of 217 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  included 545 million  of impairment losses from two operating centers that have been sold offset by 219 million  in gains net of taxes from the sale of properties and the operations of the shopping centers sold during 2012  and 2013  income from discontinued operations of 166 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  included 59 million  in gains net of taxes from the sale of properties and the operations including 34 million  of impairments of the shopping centers sold during 2011  2012  and 2013

1 includes our prorata share of unconsolidated coinvestment partnerships 

environmental matters 

we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers and underground petroleum storage tanks we believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations generally we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to more environmentally friendly systems where available we have applied and been accepted into statesponsored environmental programs we have a blanket environmental insurance policy for thirdparty liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination we have also placed environmental insurance where possible on specific properties with known contamination in order to mitigate our environmental risk we monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites we also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so 

as of december 31 2013  we had accrued liabilities of 119 million  for our prorata share of environmental remediation we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations however we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities that any previous owner occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants by the condition of nearby properties or by unrelated third parties or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us 

inflationdeflation 

inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers however inflation may become a greater concern in the future substantially all of our longterm leases contain 

 60 

provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation most of our leases require tenants to pay their prorata share of operating expenses including commonarea maintenance real estate taxes insurance and utilities thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation in addition many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years which permits us to seek increased rents upon rerental at market rates however during deflationary periods or periods of economic weakness minimum rents and percentage rents will decline as the supply of available retail space exceeds demand and consumer spending declines occupancy declines resulting from a weak economic period will also likely result in lower recovery rates of our operating expenses 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

we are exposed to two significant components of interest rate risk 

 

 

we have 1500 million  and 3500 million  of fixed rate unsecured debt maturing in april 2014  and august 2015  respectively as the economy improves long term interest rates may continue to increase in order to mitigate the risk of interest rate volatility we entered into 3950 million  of forward starting interest rate swaps for new debt issues occurring through august 1 2016 these interest rate swaps lock in the 10year treasury rate and swap spread at a weighted average fixed rate of 245  these rates are exclusive of our credit spread at the time of debt issuance 

we continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt to repay maturing debt or fund our commitments based upon the current capital markets our current credit ratings our current capacity under our unsecured credit facilities and the number of high quality unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings we expect that we will be able to successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund these debt obligations 

our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the table below presents the principal cash flows weighted average interest rates of remaining debt and the fair value of total debt as of december 31 2013  dollars in thousands the table is presented by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes although the average interest rate for variable rate debt is included in the table those rates represent rates that existed as of december 31 2013  and are subject to change on a monthly basis further the table below incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2013  and does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date since firm commitments are not presented the table has limited predictive value as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at that time and actual interest rates

 item 1 business 

regency centers corporation began its operations as a real estate investment trust reit in 1993 and is the managing general partner in regency centers lp we endeavor to be the preeminent bestinclass national shopping center company distinguished by sustaining growth in shareholder value and compounding total shareholder return in excess of our peers we work to achieve these goals through reliable growth in net operating income from a portfolio of dominant infill shopping centers balance sheet strength valueadded development capabilities and an engaged team of talented and dedicated people all of our operating investing and financing activities are performed through the operating partnership its whollyowned subsidiaries and through its investments in real estate partnerships with third parties also referred to as coinvestment partnerships or joint ventures the parent company currently owns approximately 998  of the outstanding common partnership units of the operating partnership 

at december 31 2012  we directly owned 204  shopping centers the “consolidated properties” located in 24  states representing 225 million  square feet of gross leasable area “gla” through coinvestment partnerships we own partial ownership interests in 144  shopping centers the “unconsolidated properties” located in 24  states and the district of columbia representing 178 million  square feet of gla 

we earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to grocery stores major retail anchors restaurants sideshop retailers and service providers as well as ground leasing or selling building pads outparcels to these same types of tenants historically we have experienced growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates in our existing shopping centers and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers at december 31 2012  the consolidated shopping centers were 941  leased as compared to 922  at december 31 2011  

we monitor the operating performance and rent collections of all tenants in our shopping centers especially those tenants operating retail formats that are experiencing significant changes in competition business practice and store closings in other locations we also evaluate consumer preferences shopping behaviors and demographics to anticipate both challenges and opportunities in the changing retail industry that may affect our tenants 

we grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions of operating centers and new shopping center development we will continue to use our development capabilities market presence and anchor relationships to invest in valueadded new development and redevelopments of existing centers development is customer driven meaning we generally have an executed lease from the anchor before we start construction developments serve the growth needs of our anchors and retailers resulting in modern shopping centers with longterm anchor leases that produce attractive returns on our invested capital this development process typically requires two to three years once construction has commenced but can vary subject to the size and complexity of the project we fund our acquisition and development activity from various capital sources including property sales equity offerings and new debt 

  

coinvestment partnerships provide us with an additional capital source for shopping center acquisitions as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset management property management and other investing and financing services as asset manager we are engaged by our partners to apply similar operating investment and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the coinvestment partnerships as those applied to the portfolio that we whollyown coinvestment partnerships grow their shopping center investments through acquisitions from third parties or direct purchases from us although selling properties to coinvestment partnerships reduces our direct ownership interest it provides a source of capital that further strengthens our balance sheet while we continue to share to the extent of our ownership interest in the risks and rewards of shopping centers that meet our high quality standards and longterm investment strategy 

we recognize the importance of continually improving the environmental sustainability performance of our real estate assets to date we have received leed leadership in energy and environmental design certifications by the us green building council at seven shopping centers and have four additional inprocess developments targeting certification we also continue to implement best practices in our operating portfolio to reduce our power and water consumption in addition to other sustainability initiatives we believe that the design construction and operation of environmentally efficient shopping centers will contribute to our key strategic goals 

competition 

  

we are among the largest owners of shopping centers in the nation based on revenues number of properties gross leasable area and market capitalization there are numerous companies and private individuals engaged in the ownership development acquisition and operation of shopping centers that compete with us in our targeted markets including grocery store chains that also anchor some of our shopping centers this results in competition for attracting anchor tenants as well as the acquisition of existing shopping centers and new development sites we believe that our competitive advantages are driven by our locations within our market areas the design and high quality of our shopping centers the strong demographics surrounding our shopping centers our relationships with our anchor tenants and our sideshop and outparcel retailers our practice of maintaining and renovating our shopping centers and our ability to source and develop new shopping centers 

  

employees 

  

our headquarters are located at one independent drive suite 114 jacksonville florida we presently maintain 17 market offices nationwide where we conduct management leasing construction and investment activities at december 31 2012  we had 368 employees and we believe that our relations with our employees are good 

  compliance with governmental regulations 

  

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate certain hazardous or toxic substances at our shopping centers these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances the cost of required remediation and the owners liability for remediation could exceed the value of the property andor the aggregate assets of the owner the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral while we have a number of properties that could require or are currently undergoing varying levels of environmental remediation environmental remediation is not currently expected to have a material financial impact on us due to reserves for remediation insurance programs designed to mitigate the cost of remediation and various stateregulated programs that shift the responsibility and cost to the state

 item 1a risk factors 

risk factors related to our industry and real estate investments 

downturns in the retail industry likely will have a direct adverse impact on our revenues and cash flow 

our properties consist primarily of groceryanchored shopping centers our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space the market for retail space has been or could be adversely affected by any of the following 

 

to the extent that any of these conditions occur they are likely to impact market rents for retail space occupancy in the operating portfolios our ability to sell acquire or develop properties and our cash available for distributions to stock and unit holders 

our revenues and cash flow could be adversely affected by poor economic or market conditions where our properties are geographically concentrated which may impede our ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses and maintain our properties 

the economic conditions in markets in which our properties are concentrated greatly influence our financial performance during the year ended december 31 2012  our properties in california florida and texas accounted for 306 111 and 110 respectively of our net income our revenues and cash available to pay expenses maintain our properties and for distributions to stock and unit holders could be adversely affected by this geographic concentration if market conditions such as supply of or demand for retail space deteriorate in california florida or texas relative to other geographic areas 

loss of revenues from significant tenants could reduce distributions to stock and unit holders 

we derive significant revenues from anchor tenants such as kroger publix safeway and supervalu which are our four most significant anchor tenants as they account for 43  42  33  and 21  respectively of our total annualized base rent from consolidated properties plus our prorata share of annualized base rent from unconsolidated properties prorata basis which is recognized in equity in income loss of investment in real estate partnerships for the year ended december 31 2012  distributions to stock and unit holders could be adversely affected by the loss of revenues in the event a significant tenant 

 

vacated anchor space including space owned by the anchor can reduce rental revenues generated by the shopping center because of the loss of the departed anchor tenants customer drawing power some anchors have the right to vacate and prevent retenanting by paying rent for the balance of the lease term if significant tenants vacate a property then other tenants may be entitled to terminate their leases at the property 

our net income depends on the success and continued occupancy of our tenants 

our net income could be adversely affected in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of any of our anchors or a significant number of our nonanchor tenants within a shopping center or if we fail to lease significant portions of our new developments the adverse impact on our net income may be greater than the loss of rent from the resulting unoccupied space because cotenancy clauses in select centers may allow other tenants to modify or terminate their rent or lease obligations cotenancy clauses have several variants they may allow a tenant to postpone a store opening if certain other tenants fail to open their stores they may allow a tenant to close its store prior to lease expiration if another tenant closes its store prior to lease expiration or more commonly they may allow a tenant to pay reduced levels of rent until a certain number of tenants open their stores within the same shopping center 

a large percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller shop tenants and our net income could be adversely impacted if our smaller shop tenants are not successful 

a large percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller shop tenants those occupying less than 10000 square feet smaller shop tenants may be more vulnerable to negative economic conditions as they have more limited resources than larger tenants the types of smaller shop tenants vary from retail shops to service providers if we are unable to attract the right type or mix of smaller shop tenants into our centers our net income could be adversely impacted 

we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy 

although minimum rent is supported by longterm lease contracts tenants who file bankruptcy have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and rejects its leases we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues and may not be able to collect all prepetition amounts owed by that party 

our real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges 

our longlived assets primarily real estate held for investment are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable we evaluate whether there are any indicators including property operating performance and general market conditions that the value of the real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may not be recoverable through the evaluation we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions including rental rates costs of tenant improvements leasing commissions anticipated hold periods and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition including the exit capitalization rate these key assumptions are subjective in nature and could differ materially from actual results changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the companys financial condition or operating performance to the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value if such indicators as described above are not identified management will not assess the recoverability of a propertys carrying value 

the fair value of real estate assets is highly subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the traditional discounted cash flow approach such cash flow projections consider factors including expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other factors and therefore are subject to a significant degree of management judgment changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land we generally use market data and comparable sales information 

these subjective assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment charge results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income there can be no assurance that we will not take additional charges in the future related to the impairment of our assets any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the charge is taken 

adverse global market and economic conditions may adversely affect us and could cause us to recognize additional impairment charges or otherwise harm our performance 

we are unable to predict the timing severity and length of adverse market and economic conditions adverse market and economic conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flow to pay expenses maintain properties pay distributions to our stock and unit holders and refinance debt during adverse periods there may be significant uncertainty in the valuation of our properties and investments that could result in a substantial decrease in their value no assurance can be given that we would be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our properties and investments in the future our failure to do so would require us to recognize additional impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion which could materially and adversely affect us and the market price of our common stock 

our acquisition activities may not produce the returns that we expect 

our investment strategy includes investing in highquality shopping centers that are leased to marketdominant grocers categoryleading anchors specialty retailers or restaurants located in areas with high barriers to entry and above average household incomes and population densities the acquisition of properties entails risks that include but are not limited to the following any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

 

unsuccessful development activities or a slowdown in development activities could have a direct impact on our revenues and our revenue growth 

we actively pursue development activities as opportunities arise development activities require various government and other approvals for entitlements and any delay in such approvals may significantly delay the development process we may not recover our investment in development projects for which approvals are not received we incur other risks associated with development activities including 

 

if our developments are unsuccessful or we experience a slowdown in development activities our revenue growth andor operating expenses may be adversely impacted 

we may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or releasing space 

we derive most of our revenue directly or indirectly from rent received from our tenants we are subject to the risks that upon expiration or termination of leases leases for space in our properties may not be renewed space may not be released or the terms of renewal or release including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable than current lease terms as a result our results of operations and our net income could be adversely impacted 

we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly our inability to respond promptly to unfavorable changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our stock and unit holders 

geographic concentration of our properties makes our business vulnerable to natural disasters and severe weather conditions which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and operating results 

a significant portion of our property gross leasable area is located in areas that are susceptible to the harmful effects of earthquakes tropical storms hurricanes tornadoes wildfires and similar natural disasters as of december 31 2012 approximately 234  149  and 95  of our property gross leasable area on a prorata basis was located in california florida and texas respectively intense weather conditions during the last decade have caused our cost of property insurance to increase significantly while much of the cost of this insurance is passed on to our tenants as reimbursable property costs some tenants do not pay a pro rata share of these costs under their leases these weather conditions also disrupt our business and the business of our tenants which could affect the ability of some tenants to pay rent and may reduce the willingness of residents to remain in or move to the affected area therefore as a result of the geographic concentration of our properties we face demonstrable risks including higher costs such as uninsured property losses and higher insurance premiums and disruptions to our business and the businesses of our tenants 

an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the insurance policies on our properties could subject us to loss of capital or revenue on those properties 

we carry comprehensive liability fire flood extended coverage rental loss and environmental insurance for our properties with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties we believe that the insurance carried on our properties is adequate and consistent with industry standards there are however some types of losses such as from hurricanes terrorism wars or earthquakes which may be uninsurable or the cost of insuring against such losses may not be economically justifiable in addition tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons or damage to personal or real property on or off the premises due to activities conducted by tenants or their agents on the properties including without limitation any environmental contamination and at the tenants expense to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease liability and property damage insurance policies however our tenants may not properly maintain their insurance policies or have the ability to pay the deductibles associated with such policies should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from one or more of the properties which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition as well as our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders 

loss of our key personnel could adversely affect the value of our parent companys stock price 

we depend on the efforts of our key executive personnel although we believe qualified replacements could be found for our key executives the loss of their services could adversely affect our parent companys stock price 

we face competition from numerous sources including other real estate investment trusts and small real estate owners 

the ownership of shopping centers is highly fragmented we face competition from other real estate investment trusts as well as from numerous small owners in the acquisition ownership and leasing of shopping centers we compete to develop shopping centers with other real estate investment trusts engaged in development activities as well as with local regional and national real estate developers if we cannot successfully compete in our targeted markets our cash flow and therefore distributions to stock and unit holders may be adversely affected 

costs of environmental remediation could reduce our cash flow available for distribution to stock and unit holders 

under various federal state and local laws an owner or manager of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on the property these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances the cost of any required remediation could exceed the value of the property andor the aggregate assets of the owner or the responsible party the presence of or the failure to properly remediate hazardous or toxic substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a contaminated property or to borrow using the property as collateral any of these developments could reduce cash flow and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders 

compliance with the americans with disabilities act and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that adversely affect our cash flows 

all of our properties are required to comply with the americans with disabilities act “ada” the ada has separate compliance requirements for “public accommodations” and “commercial facilities” but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants or both while the tenants to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions and typically under tenant leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these tenants to cover costs could be adversely affected in addition we are required to operate the properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations as they may be adopted by governmental entities and become applicable to the properties we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with these requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our financial obligations and make distributions to our stock and unit holders 

if we do not maintain the security of tenantrelated information we could incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation 

we have implemented an online payment system where we receive certain information about our tenants that depends upon secure transmissions of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments a compromise of our security systems that results in information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties in addition a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage our business disruptions in both our primary and secondary backup systems could harm our ability to run our business 

although we have independent redundant and physically separate primary and secondary computer systems it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our businesscritical computer systems our computer systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees if our computer systems and our backup systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in both of our computer systems and backup systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

risk factors related to our coinvestment partnerships and acquisition structure 

we do not have voting control over our joint venture investments so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued 

we have invested as a partner in a number of joint venture investments for the acquisition or development of properties these investments involve risks not present in a whollyowned project we do not have voting control over the ventures the other partner might i have interests or goals that are inconsistent with our interests or goals or ii otherwise impede our objectives the other partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt these factors could limit the return that we receive from such investments or cause our cash flows to be lower than our estimates 

the termination of our coinvestment partnerships could adversely affect our cash flow operating results and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders 

if coinvestment partnerships owning a significant number of properties were dissolved for any reason we would lose the asset and property management fees from these coinvestment partnerships which could adversely affect our operating results and our cash available for distribution to stock and unit holders 

risk factors related to funding strategies and capital structure 

higher market capitalization rates for our properties could adversely impact our ability to sell properties and fund developments and acquisitions and could dilute earnings 

as part of our funding strategy we sell operating properties that no longer meet our investment standards these sales proceeds are used to fund the construction of new developments an increase in market capitalization rates could cause a reduction in the value of centers identified for sale which would have an adverse impact on the amount of cash generated in order to meet the cash requirements of our development program we may be required to sell more properties than initially planned which could have a negative impact on our earnings 

we depend on external sources of capital which may not be available in the future on favorable terms or at all 

to qualify as a reit the parent company must among other things distribute to its stockholders each year at least 90 of its reit taxable income excluding any net capital gains because of these distribution requirements we will likely not be able to fund all future capital needs including capital for acquisitions or developments with income from operations we therefore will have to rely on thirdparty sources of capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all our access to thirdparty sources of capital depends on a number of things including the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings our access to debt depends on our credit rating the willingness of creditors to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets in addition to finding creditors willing to lend to us we are dependent upon our joint venture partners to contribute their share of any amount needed to repay or refinance existing debt when lenders reduce the amount of debt our joint ventures are eligible to refinance 

  in addition our existing debt arrangements also impose covenants that limit our flexibility in obtaining other financing such as a prohibition on negative pledge agreements additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders interests and additional debt financing may substantially increase our degree of leverage 

without access to external sources of capital we would be required to pay outstanding debt with our operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales our operating cash flows may not be sufficient to pay our outstanding debt as it comes due and real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly at a return we believe is appropriate if we are required to deleverage our business with operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales we may be forced to reduce the amount of or eliminate altogether our distributions to stock and unit holders or refrain from making investments in our business 

our debt financing may reduce distributions to stock and unit holders 

our organizational documents do not limit the amount of debt that we may incur in addition we do not expect to generate sufficient funds from operations to make balloon principal payments on our debt when due if we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms we might be forced i to dispose of properties which might result in losses or ii to obtain financing at unfavorable terms either could reduce the cash flow available for distributions to stock and unit holders if we cannot make required mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose on the property securing the mortgage causing the loss of cash flow from that property 

covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition 

our unsecured notes unsecured term loan and unsecured line of credit contain customary covenants including compliance with financial ratios such as ratio of total debt to gross asset value and fixed charge coverage ratio fixed charge coverage ratio is defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda divided by the sum of interest expense and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders our debt arrangements also restrict our ability to enter into a transaction that would result in a change of control these covenants may limit our operational flexibility and our acquisition activities moreover if we breach any of the covenants in our debt agreements and did not cure the breach within the applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately even in the absence of a payment default many of our debt arrangements including our unsecured notes unsecured term loan and unsecured line of credit are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other material debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our stock 

increases in interest rates would cause our borrowing costs to rise and negatively impact our results of operations 

  

while a significant amount of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates we do borrow funds at variable interest rates under our credit facilities increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense on any variable rate debt in addition increases in interest rates will affect the terms under which we refinance our existing debt as it matures 

this would reduce our future earnings and cash flows which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our stock and unit holders 

risk factors related to interest rates and the market price for our stock 

changes in economic and market conditions could adversely affect the parent companys stock price 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors many of which are out of our control including 

 

these factors may cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of our financial condition results of operations business or prospects it is impossible to ensure that the market price of our common stock will not fall in the future a decrease in the market price of our common stock could reduce our ability to raise additional equity in the public markets selling common stock at a decreased market price would have a dilutive impact on existing stockholders 

risk factors related to federal income tax laws 

if the parent company fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes it would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 

we believe that we qualify for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes and we plan to operate so that we can continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit if we qualify as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on our income that we distribute currently to our stockholders many of the reit requirements however are highly technical and complex the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances some of which may not be totally within our control and some of which involve questions of interpretation for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income must come from specific passive sources like rent that are itemized in the reit tax laws there can be no assurance that the internal revenue service “irs” or a court would agree with the positions we have taken in interpreting the reit requirements we are also required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains the fact that we hold many of our assets through coinvestment partnerships and their subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status furthermore congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult or impossible for us to remain qualified as a reit 

also unless the irs granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we would remain disqualified as a reit for four years following the year we first failed to qualify if we failed to qualify as a reit currently andor with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired we would have to pay significant income taxes reducing cash available to pay dividends which would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to pay any dividends to stockholders although we believe that we qualify as a reit we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes 

even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we are required to pay certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from “prohibited transactions” that income will be subject to a 100 tax in general prohibited transactions include sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business the determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale while we have undertaken a significant number of asset sales in recent years we do not believe that those sales should be considered prohibited transactions but there can be no assurance that the irs would not contend otherwise 

risk factors related to our ownership limitations and the florida business corporation act 

restrictions on the ownership of the parent companys capital stock to preserve our reit status could delay or prevent a change in control 

ownership of more than 7 by value of our outstanding capital stock is prohibited with certain exceptions by our articles of incorporation for the purpose of maintaining our qualification as a reit this 7 limitation may discourage a change in control and may also i deter tender offers for our capital stock which offers may be attractive to our stockholders or ii limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their capital stock that might otherwise exist if an investor attempted to assemble a block in excess of 7 of our outstanding capital stock or to affect a change in control 

the issuance of the parent companys capital stock could delay or prevent a change in control 

our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to 30000000 shares of preferred stock and 10000000 shares of special common stock and to establish the preferences and rights of any shares issued the issuance of preferred stock or special common stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control the provisions of the florida business corporation act regarding control share acquisitions and affiliated transactions could also deter potential acquisitions by preventing the acquiring party from voting the common stock it acquires or consummating a merger or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of our disinterested stockholders

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

regency centers corporation began its operations as a reit in 1993 and is the managing general partner in regency centers lp we endeavor to be the preeminent bestinclass national shopping center company distinguished by sustaining growth in shareholder value and compounding total shareholder return in excess of our peers we work to achieve these goals through reliable growth in net operating income from a portfolio of dominant infill shopping centers balance sheet strength valueadded development capabilities and an engaged team of talented and dedicated people all of our operating investing and financing activities are performed through the operating partnership its whollyowned subsidiaries and through its investments in real estate partnerships with third parties also referred to as coinvestment partnerships or joint ventures the parent company currently owns approximately 998  of the outstanding common partnership units of the operating partnership 

at december 31 2012  we directly owned 204  shopping centers the “consolidated properties” located in 24  states representing 225 million  square feet of gross leasable area “gla” through coinvestment partnerships we own partial ownership interests in 144  shopping centers the “unconsolidated properties” located in 24  states and the district of columbia representing 178 million  square feet of gla 

we earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to grocery stores major retail anchors restaurants sideshop retailers and service providers as well as by ground leasing or selling building pads outparcels to these same types of tenants we experience growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates in our existing shopping centers and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers at december 31 2012  the consolidated shopping centers were 941  leased as compared to 922  at december 31 2011  

we monitor the operating performance and rent collections of all tenants in our shopping centers especially those tenants operating retail formats that are experiencing significant changes in competition business practice and store closings in other locations we also evaluate consumer preferences shopping behaviors and demographics to anticipate both challenges and opportunities in the changing retail industry that may affect our tenants 

we grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions of operating centers and new shopping center development we will continue to use our development capabilities market presence and anchor relationships to invest in valueadded new developments and redevelopments of existing centers development is customer driven meaning we generally have an executed lease from the anchor before we start construction developments serve the growth needs of our anchors and retailers resulting in modern shopping centers with longterm anchor leases that produce attractive returns on our invested capital this development process typically requires two to three years once construction has commenced but can vary subject to the size and complexity of the project we fund our acquisition and development activity from various capital sources including property sales equity offerings and new debt 

coinvestment partnerships provide us with an additional capital source for shopping center acquisitions as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset management property management and other investing and financing services as asset manager we are engaged by our partners to apply similar operating investment and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the coinvestment partnerships as those applied to the portfolio that we whollyown coinvestment partnerships grow their shopping center investments through acquisitions from third parties or direct purchases from us although selling properties to coinvestment partnerships reduces our direct ownership interest it provides a source of capital that further strengthens our balance sheet while we continue to share to the extent of our ownership interest in the risks and rewards of shopping centers that meet our high quality standards and longterm investment strategy 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial statements the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities at a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period these accounting estimates are based upon but not limited to our judgments about historical results current economic activity and industry accounting standards they are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness however the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates 

accounts receivable   

minimum rent percentage rent and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs insurance and real estate taxes are the companys principal source of revenue as a result of generating this revenue we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants we are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that may affect the collection of outstanding receivables to address the collectability of these receivables we analyze historical writeoff experience tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts although we estimate uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income actual experience may differ from those estimates 

real estate investments 

acquisition of real estate investments 

upon acquisition of real estate operating properties the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land building building improvements and tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and belowmarket leases inplace leases and tenant relationships assumed debt and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date based on these estimates the company allocates the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities fair value is determined based on an exit price approach which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date if up to one year from the acquisition date information regarding fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation on a retrospective basis the company expenses transaction costs associated with business combinations in the period incurred 

we strategically invest in entities that own manage acquire develop and redevelop operating properties we analyze our investments in real estate partnerships in order to determine whether the entity should be consolidated if it is determined that these investments do not require consolidation because the entities are not variable interest entities “vies” we are not considered the primary beneficiary of the entities determined to be vies we do not have voting control andor the limited partners or nonmanaging members have substantive participatory rights then the selection of the accounting method used to account for our investments in real estate partnerships is generally determined by our voting interests and the degree of influence we have over the entity management uses its judgment when making these determinations we use the equity method of accounting for investments in real estate partnerships when we own 20 or more of the voting interests and have significant influence but do not have a controlling financial interest or if we own less than 20 of the voting interests but have determined that we have significant influence under the equity method we record our investments in and advances to these entities in our consolidated balance sheets and our proportionate share of earnings or losses earned by the joint venture is recognized in equity in income loss of investments in real estate partnerships in our consolidated statements of operations 

  

development of real estate assets and cost capitalization 

we capitalize the acquisition of land the construction of buildings and other specifically identifiable development costs incurred by recording them into properties in development in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets once a development property is substantially complete and held available for occupancy costs are no longer capitalized other specifically identifiable development costs include predevelopment costs essential to the development process as well as interest real estate taxes and direct employee costs incurred during the development period predevelopment costs are incurred prior to land acquisition during the due diligence phase and include contract deposits legal engineering and other professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center at december 31 2012  and 2011  the company had capitalized predevelopment costs of 35 million  and 21 million  respectively of which 23 million  and 10 million  respectively were refundable deposits if we determine it is probable that a specific project undergoing due diligence will not be developed we immediately expense all 

related capitalized predevelopment costs not considered recoverable during the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  we expensed predevelopment costs of approximately 15 million  241000  and 520000  respectively recorded in other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations interest costs are capitalized into each development project based on applying our weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the actual development costs expended we cease interest cost capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements but in no event would we capitalize interest on the project beyond 12 months after substantial completion of the building shell during the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  we capitalized interest of 37 million  15 million  and 51 million respectively on our development projects we have a staff of employees who directly support our development program all direct internal costs attributable to these development activities are capitalized as part of each development project during the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  we capitalized 103 million  55 million  and 27 million respectively of direct internal costs incurred to support our development program the capitalization of costs is directly related to the actual level of development activity occurring 

valuation of real estate investments 

we evaluate whether there are any indicators that have occurred including property operating performance and general market conditions that would result in us determining that the carrying value of our real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may not be recoverable if such indicators occur we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions including rental rates costs of tenant improvements leasing commissions anticipated hold period and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition including the exit capitalization rate these key assumptions are subjective in nature and the resulting impairment if any could differ from the actual gain or loss recognized upon ultimate sale in an arms length transaction if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the companys financial condition or operating performance 

we evaluate our investments in real estate partnerships for impairment whenever there are indicators including underlying property operating performance and general market conditions that the value of our investments in real estate partnerships may be impaired an investment in a real estate partnerships is considered impaired only if we determine that its fair value is less than the net carrying value of the investment in that real estate partnerships on an otherthantemporary basis cash flow projections for the investments consider property level factors such as expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other factors we consider various qualitative factors to determine if a decrease in the value of our investment is otherthantemporary these factors include the age of the real estate partnerships our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity the financial condition and longterm prospects of the entity and relationships with our partners and banks if we believe that the decline in the fair value of the investment is temporary no impairment charge is recorded if our analysis indicates that there is an otherthantemporary impairment related to the investment in a particular real estate partnerships the carrying value of the investment will be adjusted to an amount that reflects the estimated fair value of the investment 

the fair value of real estate investments is highly subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization or the traditional discounted cash flow methods such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other factors and therefore are subject to a significant degree of management judgment and changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land we generally use market data and comparable sales information

although base rent is supported by longterm lease contracts tenants who file bankruptcy may have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues we monitor industry trends and sales data to help us identify declines in retail categories or tenants who might be experiencing financial difficulties as a result of slowing sales lack of credit changes in retail formats or increased competition as a result of our findings we may reduce new leasing suspend leasing or curtail the allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements within a certain retail category or to a specific retailer 

we monitor the financial condition of our tenants we communicate often with those tenants who have announced store closings or filed bankruptcy we are not currently aware of the pending bankruptcy or announced store closings of any tenants in our shopping centers that would individually cause a material reduction in our revenues and no tenant represents more than 5 of our total annualized base rent on a prorata basis

results from operations 

comparison of the year s ended december 31 2012  to 2011  

our revenues increased by 38 million  or 08  in 2012  as compared to 2011  as summarized in the following table in thousands   



minimum rent increased 91 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  compared to the year ended december 31 2011  despite a 132 million decrease attributable to the sale of a 15property portfolio on july 25 2012 this portfolio was sold for total consideration of 2735 million net of a 475 million retained investment in the acquiring real estate partnership as of december 31 2012  this asset group did not meet the definition of discontinued operations in accordance with fasb asc topic 20520 presentation of financial statements  discontinued operations based on our continuing involvement 

the increase in minimum rent is due to increased average occupancy levels at our consolidated properties from 922  leased at december 31 2011  to 941  leased at december 31 2012  combined with an increase in average base rent per square foot psf from 1659 psf for the year ended december 31 2011  to 1686 psf for the year ended december 31 2012  minimum rent also increased 29 million due to the acquisition of five operating properties and four development properties since december 31 2011  

recoveries from tenants represent their share of the operating maintenance and real estate tax expenses that we incur to operate our shopping centers as well as other income recoveries increased during the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to the year ended december 31 2011  primarily due to increased average occupancy although recoveries were partially offset by declines in recovery revenue from the sale of real estate 

we earned fees at marketbased rates for asset management property management leasing acquisition and financing services that we provided to our coinvestment partnerships and third parties as follows in thousands   

  

  

the decrease in fees in 2012 was primarily the result of the liquidation of the desco coinvestment partnership during 2011 which included a 50 million disposition fee and a 10 million consulting fee we received as a result of the liquidation asset management fees property management fees and leasing commissions also declined as a result of the sale of properties held by our coinvestment partnerships since december 31 2011  

  

our operating expenses increased by 31 million  or 10  in 2012  as compared to 2011  the following table summarizes our operating expenses in thousands   



depreciation and amortization expense and operating and maintenance expense decreased 22 million  and 18 million  respectively for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to the year ended december 31 2011  due to mild winter weather and a net reduction in the number of shopping centers owned during 2012  general and administrative expense increased 56 million  primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation expense as a result of exceeding performance targets 

the following table presents the components of other expense income in thousands 



as discussed above we sold a 15property portfolio during 2012 and as a result of this sale we recognized a net impairment loss of 181 million during the year ended december 31 2012  additional impairment of 567 million was recognized related to two operating properties and three land parcels the majority of this impairment 500 million  related to one operating property which we determined was more likely than not to be sold before the end of its previously estimated hold period which led to the impairment this property is located in a master planned community of north los vegas a market that was significantly impacted by the housing market crash this is the only property owned by us in this market and we currently do not intend to hold the property for a term that we estimate would be necessary for us to recover our investment the other operating property exhibited weak operating fundamentals including low economic occupancy for an extended period of time which led to a 45 million  impairment 

during the year ended december 31 2011  a 124 million provision for impairment was recognized related to two operating properties that exhibited weak operating fundamentals including low economic occupancy for an extended period of time which lead to the impairment 

 on july 20 2012  we repaid 150 million  of our term loan and as a result of this early extinguishment of debt we expensed approximately 852000  in loan costs 

the 23 million  increase in net investment income from deferred compensation plan related to the change in the fair value of plan assets from december 31 2011  to december 31 2012  and is consistent with the change in plan liabilities 

the following table presents the change in net interest expense in thousands   



interest on notes payable decreased and interest on unsecured credit facilities increased during the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to the year ended december 31 2011  as a result of the repayment of 1924 million of 675 unsecured debt in january 2012 using proceeds from our term loan and 800 million line of credit at lower interest rates additional interest was capitalized during 2012 due to increased development activity 

our equity in income loss of investments in real estate partnerships increased by 142 million  in 2012  as compared to 2011  as follows in thousands   



the increase in our equity in income loss in investments in real estate partnerships for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to the year ended december 31 2011  is primarily due to the recognition of our prorata share of the 345 million gain on sale of an operating property in the columbia i partnership during second quarter of 2012 the new ownership joint venture interest retained in bret as part of the portfolio sale during the three months ended december 31 2012  and a 46 million impairment recognized on one investment in a real estate partnership during the first quarter of 2011

  on october 29 2010 rclp completed a tender offer for outstanding debt by purchasing 118 million of its 1735 million 795 unsecured notes maturing in january 2011 and 576 million of its 2500 million 675 unsecured notes maturing in january 2012 collectively the “notes” the company recognized a 42 million expense for the early extinguishment of this debt 

the 22 million  increase in net investment income from deferred compensation plan related to the change in the fair value of plan assets from december 31 2010  to december 31 2011  and is consistent with the change in plan liabilities 

the following table presents the change in interest expense in thousands   



interest on notes payable decreased during the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to the year ended december 31 2010  as a result of the repayment of 1617 million and 200 million of unsecured debt in january 2011 and december 2011 respectively capitalized interest decreased as a result of reduced development activity during the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to 2010  hedge interest increased as a result of 367 million of hedges settled on september 30 2010 with the realized loss being amortized over a ten year period beginning october 2010 

  

our equity in income loss of investments in real estate partnerships increased by 225 million  in 2011  as compared to 2010  as follows in thousands   



the increase in our equity in income loss in investments in real estate partnerships for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to the year ended december 31 2010  is related to our prorata share of the decrease in depreciation expense of 57 million the decrease in interest expense of 59 million the decrease in impairment provisions of 185 million and the net gain on extinguishment of debt of 17 million offset by a decrease in net operating income of 78 million and a gain on sale of properties of approximately 700000 at the individual real estate partnerships 

the following represents the remaining components to determine net income attributable to the common stockholders and unit holders for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to the year ended december 31 2010  in thousands 



income tax expense increased 43 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to the year ended december 31 2010  primarily due to the increase in deferred income taxes in 2011 and a tax benefit recognized in 2010 

income from discontinued operations was 80 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  and includes 59 million  in gains net of taxes from the sale of seven properties and the operations of the shopping centers sold income from discontinued operations was 89 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  and includes 76 million  in gains net of taxes from the sale of three properties and the operations including impairment of the shopping centers sold 

gain on sale of real estate increased approximately 14 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to the year ended december 31 2010  during the year ended december 31 2011  we sold eight outparcels for no gain and we sold two operating properties that did not meet the definition of discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement for a gain of 24 million during the year ended december 31 2010  we sold eleven outparcels for a gain of approximately 661000 and we sold three operating properties for a gain of approximately 332000 these properties did not meet the definition of discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement 

the income attributable to noncontrolling interests remained relatively consistent for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to the year ended december 31 2010  increasing approximately 233000 preferred stock dividends also remained consistent between 2011  and 2010  

related to our parent companys results our net income attributable to common stockholders for the year ended december 31 2011  was 317 million  an increase of 426 million  as compared to net loss of 109 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  the higher net income was primarily related to the increase in revenue offset partially by the increase in operating expenses from 2010 to 2011 as discussed above a decrease in impairment provisions of 75 million  the 42 million  net loss on extinguishment of debt incurred in 2010 and an increase in equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships of 225 million  our diluted net income per share was 035  for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to diluted net loss per share of 014  for the year ended december 31 2010  

related to our operating partnership results our net income attributable to common unit holders for the year ended december 31 2011  was 318 million  an increase of 426 million  as compared to net loss of 108 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  for the same reasons stated above our diluted net income per unit was 035  for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to diluted net loss per unit of 014  for the year ended december 31 2010

the companys reconciliation of net income available to common shareholders to ffo and core ffo for the years ended december 31 2012  and 2011  is as follows in thousands except share information 



environmental matters 

we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers and underground petroleum storage tanks we believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations generally we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to more environmentally friendly systems where available we have applied and been accepted into statesponsored environmental programs we have a blanket environmental insurance policy for thirdparty liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination we have also placed environmental insurance where possible on specific properties with known contamination in order to mitigate our environmental risk we monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites we also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so at december 31 2012  we had reserves of 93 million  for our prorata share of environmental remediation primarily from property acquisitions we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations however we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities that any previous owner occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants by the condition of nearby properties or by unrelated third parties or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us 

inflationdeflation 

inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers however inflation may become a greater concern in the future substantially all of our longterm leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation most of our leases require tenants to pay their prorata share of operating expenses including commonarea maintenance real estate taxes insurance and utilities thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation in addition many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years which permits us to seek increased rents upon rerental at market rates however during deflationary periods or periods of economic weakness minimum rents and percentage rents may decline as the supply of available retail space exceeds demand and consumer spending declines occupancy declines resulting from a weak economic period will also likely result in lower recovery rates of our operating expenses 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

we are exposed to two significant components of interest rate risk 

 we have 1816 million  of fixed rate debt maturing in 2013 and 2014 that has a weighted average fixed interest rate of 522 which includes 1500 million  of unsecured longterm debt that matures in april 2014  we also have 3500 million of unsecured longterm debt that matures in 2015 in order to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising before we obtain new unsecured borrowings in 2014 and 2015 we entered into five forwardstarting interest rate swaps during december 2012 for 

the same ten year periods we expect for our future borrowings these swaps total 3000 million of notional value with weighted average fixed ten year swap rates of 209 for those starting in 2014 and 248 for those starting in 2015 as discussed in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements we continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt to repay maturing debt or fund our commitments based upon the current capital markets our current credit ratings our current capacity under our line and term loan and the number of high quality unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings we expect that we will be able to successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund these debt obligations 

our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the table below presents the principal cash flows in thousands excluding interest expense weighted average interest rates of remaining debt and the fair value of total debt in thousands as of december 31 2012  by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes although the average interest rate for variable rate debt is included in the table those rates represent rates that existed at december 31 2012  and are subject to change on a monthly basis 

the table below incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2012  and does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date since firm commitments are not presented the table has limited predictive value as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at that time and actual interest rates

 item 1 business 

regency centers corporation began its operations as a real estate investment trust “reit” in 1993 and is the managing general partner in regency centers lp we are focused on achieving total shareholder returns in excess of reit shopping center averages and sustaining growth in our net asset value and our earnings over an extended period of time we work to achieve these goals through owning operating and investing in a highquality portfolio of primarily groceryanchored shopping centers that are leased by marketdominant grocers categoryleading anchors specialty retailers and restaurants located in areas with above average household incomes and population densities all of our operating investing and financing activities are performed through the operating partnership its whollyowned subsidiaries and through its investments in real estate partnerships with third parties also referred to as coinvestment partnerships or joint ventures the parent company currently owns approximately 998  of the outstanding common partnership units of the operating partnership 

at december 31 2011  we directly owned 217  shopping centers the “consolidated properties” located in 24  states representing 238 million  square feet of gross leasable area “gla” through coinvestment partnerships we own partial ownership interests in 147  shopping centers the “unconsolidated properties” located in 24  states and the district of columbia representing 184 million  square feet of gla 

we earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to grocery stores major retail anchors sideshop retailers and restaurants including ground leasing or selling building pads outparcels to these same types of tenants historically we have experienced growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates in our existing shopping centers and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers increasing occupancy in our shopping centers to prerecession levels and achieving positive rental rate growth are key objectives of our strategic plan 

we grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions of operating centers and shopping center development we will continue to use our unique combination of development capabilities market presence and anchor relationships to invest in valueadded opportunities sourced from land owners and joint venture partners the redevelopment of existing centers developing land that we already own and other opportunities development is customer driven and serves the growth needs of our anchors and specialty retailers resulting in new modern shopping centers with longterm anchor leases that produce attractive returns on our invested capital 

maintaining a high quality portfolio also involves identifying and selling assets that are at risk of not achieving our longterm investment goals proceeds from these sales are targeted for reinvestment into higher quality new development redevelopment of existing centers or acquisitions that will generate sustainable revenue growth and higher returns 

  

coinvestment partnerships provide us with an additional capital source for shopping center acquisitions as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset management property management and other investing and financing services as asset manager we are engaged by our partners to apply similar operating investment and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the coinvestment partnerships as those applied to the portfolio that we whollyown coinvestment partnerships also grow their shopping center investments through acquisitions from third parties or direct purchases from us 

we recognize the importance of continually improving the environmental sustainability performance of our real estate assets to date we have received leed leadership in energy and environmental design certifications by the us green building council at three shopping centers and have five additional inprocess developments targeting certification we also continue to implement best practices in our operating portfolio to reduce our power and water consumption in addition to other sustainability initiatives it is our intent to be one of the leaders in the design construction and operation of environmentally efficient shopping centers that will contribute to our key strategic goals 

competition 

  

we are among the largest owners of shopping centers in the nation based on revenues number of properties gross leasable area and market capitalization there are numerous companies and private individuals engaged in the ownership development acquisition and operation of shopping centers which compete with us in our targeted markets including grocery store chains that also anchor some of our shopping centers this results in competition for attracting anchor tenants as well as the acquisition of existing shopping centers and new development sites we believe that the principle competitive factors in attracting tenants in our market areas are competitive infill locations above average trade area demographics rental costs tenant mix property age and property maintenance we believe that our competitive advantages are driven by our locations within our market areas the design and high quality of our shopping centers the strong demographics surrounding our shopping centers our relationships with our anchor tenants and our sideshop and outparcel retailers our premier customer initiative program that allows us to efficiently provide retailers with multiple locations our practice of maintaining and renovating our shopping centers and our ability to source and develop new shopping centers 

  

changes in policies 

  

our board of directors establishes the policies that govern our investment and operating strategies including among others development and acquisition of shopping centers tenant and market focus debt and equity financing policies quarterly distributions to stock and unit holders and reit tax status the board of directors may amend these policies at any time without a vote of our stockholders 

  

employees 

  

our headquarters are located at one independent drive suite 114 jacksonville florida we presently maintain 17 market offices nationwide where we conduct management leasing construction and investment activities at december 31 2011  we had 369 employees and we believe that we have strong relations with our employees 

  compliance with governmental regulations 

  

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate certain hazardous or toxic substances at our shopping centers these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances the cost of required remediation and the owners liability for remediation could exceed the value of the property andor the aggregate assets of the owner the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral while we have a number of properties that could require or are currently undergoing varying levels of environmental remediation environmental remediation is not currently expected to have a material financial impact on us due to reserves for remediation insurance programs designed to mitigate the cost of remediation and various stateregulated programs that shift the responsibility and cost to the state

 item 1a risk factors 

risk factors related to our industry and real estate investments 

downturns in the retail industry likely will have a direct adverse impact on our revenues and cash flow 

our properties consist primarily of groceryanchored shopping centers our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space the market for retail space has been or could be adversely affected by any of the following 

 

to the extent that any of these conditions occur they are likely to impact market rents for retail space occupancy in the operating portfolios our ability to recycle capital and our cash available for distributions to stock and unit holders 

our revenues and cash flow could be adversely affected by poor economic or market conditions where our properties are geographically concentrated which may impede our ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses and maintain our properties 

the economic conditions in markets in which our properties are concentrated greatly influence our financial performance during the year ended december 31 2011  our properties in california florida and texas accounted for 316 145 and 131 respectively of our consolidated net operating income our revenues and cash available to pay expenses maintain our properties and for distribution to stock and unit holders could be adversely affected by this geographic concentration if market conditions such as supply of retail space or demand for shopping centers deteriorate in california florida or texas relative to other geographic areas 

loss of revenues from major tenants could reduce distributions to stock and unit holders 

we derive significant revenues from anchor tenants such as kroger publix and safeway which are our three largest anchor tenants and accounted for 42  44  and 37  respectively of our annualized base rent from consolidated properties plus our prorata share of annualized base rent from unconsolidated properties prorata basis for the year ended december 31 2011  distributions to stock and unit holders could be adversely affected by the loss of revenues in the event a major tenant 

 

vacated anchor space including space owned by the anchor can reduce rental revenues generated by the shopping center because of the loss of the departed anchor tenants customer drawing power most anchors have the right to vacate and prevent retenanting by paying rent for the balance of the lease term if major tenants vacate a property then other tenants may be entitled to terminate their leases at the property 

our net income depends on the success and continued presence of our tenants 

our net income could be adversely affected if we fail to lease significant portions of our new developments or in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of any anchors or of a significant number of our nonanchor tenants within a shopping center the adverse impact on our net income may be greater than the loss of rent from the resulting unoccupied space because cotenancy clauses may allow other tenants to modify or terminate their rent or lease obligations cotenancy clauses have several variants they may allow a tenant to postpone a store opening if certain other tenants fail to open their stores they may allow a tenant to close its store prior to lease expiration if another tenant closes its store prior to lease expiration or more commonly they may allow a tenant to pay reduced levels of rent until a certain number of tenants open their stores within the same shopping center 

we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy 

although base rent is supported by longterm lease contracts tenants who file bankruptcy have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues and may not be able to collect all prepetition amounts owed by that party 

our real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges 

our longlived assets primarily real estate held for investment are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable we evaluate whether there are any indicators including property operating performance and general market conditions that the value of the real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may not be recoverable through the evaluation we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions including rental rates costs of tenant improvements leasing commissions anticipated hold period and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition including the exit capitalization rate these key assumptions are subjective in nature and could differ materially from actual results changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the companys financial condition or operating performance to the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value if such indicators are not identified management will not assess the recoverability of a propertys carrying value 

the fair value of real estate assets is highly subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the traditional discounted cash flow approach such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other factors and therefore is subject to a significant degree of management judgment and changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land we generally use market data and comparable sales information 

these subjective assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment charge results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income there can be no assurance that we will not take additional charges in the future related to the impairment of our assets any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the charge is taken 

adverse global market and economic conditions may adversely affect us and could cause us to recognize additional impairment charges or otherwise harm our performance 

we are unable to predict the timing severity and length of adverse market and economic conditions the return of adverse market and economic conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flow to pay expenses maintain properties pay distributions to our stock and unit holders and refinance debt during these adverse periods there may be significant uncertainty in the valuation of our properties and investments that could result in a substantial decrease in their value no assurance can be given that we would be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our properties and investments in the future our failure to do so would require us to recognize additional impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion which could materially and adversely affect us and the market price of our common stock 

our acquisition activities may not produce the returns that we expect 

our investment strategy includes investing in highquality groceryanchored shopping centers that are leased by marketdominant grocers categoryleading anchors specialty retailers and restaurants located in areas with above average household incomes and population densities the acquisition of properties entails risks that include the following any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

 

unsuccessful development activities or a slowdown in development activities will have a direct impact on our revenues and our revenue growth 

we actively pursue development activities as opportunities arise development activities require various government and other approvals for entitlements which can significantly delay the development process we may not recover our investment in development projects for which approvals are not received we incur other risks associated with development activities including 

 

if our developments are unsuccessful or we experience a slowdown in development activities our revenue growth andor operating expenses may be adversely impacted 

we may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or releasing space 

we derive most of our revenue directly or indirectly from rent received from our tenants we are subject to the risks that upon expiration or termination of leases leases for space in our properties may not be renewed space may not be released or the terms of renewal or release including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable than current lease terms as a result our results of operations and our net income could be reduced 

we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly we may not be able to alter our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions including being unable to sell a property at a return we believe is appropriate our inability to respond quickly to adverse changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our stock and unit holders 

changes in accounting standards may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

the sec may decide in the near future that issuers in the united states should be required to prepare financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards “ifrs” instead of us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” ifrs is a comprehensive set of accounting standards promulgated by the international accounting standards board “iasb” which are rapidly gaining worldwide acceptance changes in us gaap and changes in current interpretations are beyond our control can be hard to predict and could materially impact how we report our financial results and condition in certain cases we could be required to apply a new or revised rule retroactively or apply existing rules differently which may adversely impact our results of operations or result in our recasting prior period financial statements for material amounts additionally significant changes to us gaap may require costly technology changes additional training and personnel and other expenses that will negatively impact our results of operations 

the adoption of new accounting rules may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

the financial accounting standards board “fasb” has proposed new accounting rules which could result in significant changes in the way leases and  or real estate investments are reported in our financial statements under gaap the proposal if adopted could have a significant effect on our balance sheet fasb may issue final rules on this topic in the near future at this time we are unable to determine what effect if any the adoption of this proposal will have on our financial condition our results of operations and our financial ratios required by our debt covenants 

geographic concentration of our properties makes our business vulnerable to natural disasters and severe weather conditions which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and operating results 

a significant portion of our property gross leasable area is located in areas that are susceptible to the harmful effects of earthquakes tropical storms hurricanes tornadoes wildfires and similar natural disasters as of december 31 2011 approximately 233  192  and 124  of our property gross leasable area on a consolidated basis was located in california florida and texas respectively intense weather conditions during the last decade has caused our cost of property insurance to increase significantly while much of the cost of this insurance is passed on to our tenants as reimbursable property costs some tenants do not pay a pro rata share of these costs under their leases these weather conditions also disrupt our business and the business of our tenants which could affect the ability of some tenants to pay rent and may reduce the willingness of residents to remain in or move to the affected area therefore as a result of the geographic concentration of our properties we face demonstrable risks including higher costs such as uninsured property losses and higher insurance premiums and disruptions to our business and the businesses of our tenants 

an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the insurance policies on our properties could subject us to loss of capital or revenue on those properties 

we carry comprehensive liability fire flood extended coverage rental loss and environmental insurance for our properties with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties we believe that the insurance carried on our properties is adequate and in accordance with industry standards there are however some types of losses such as from hurricanes terrorism wars or earthquakes which may be uninsurable or the cost of insuring against such losses may not be economically justifiable in addition tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons or damage to personal or real property on or off the premises due to activities conducted by tenants or their agents on the properties including without limitation any environmental contamination and at the tenants expense to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease liability and property damage insurance policies however our tenants may not properly maintain their insurance policies or have the ability to pay the deductibles associated with such policies should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from one or more of the properties which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition as well as our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders 

loss of our key personnel could adversely affect the value of our performance and our parent companys stock price 

we depend on the efforts of our key executive personnel although we believe qualified replacements could be found for our key executives the loss of their services could adversely affect performance and our parent companys stock price 

we face competition from numerous sources including other real estate investment trusts and small real estate owners 

the ownership of shopping centers is highly fragmented we face competition from other real estate investment trusts as well as from numerous small owners in the acquisition ownership and leasing of shopping centers we compete to develop shopping centers with other real estate investment trusts engaged in development activities as well as with local regional and national real estate developers if we cannot successfully compete in our targeted markets our cash flow and therefore distributions to stock and unit holders may be adversely affected 

costs of environmental remediation could reduce our cash flow available for distribution to stock and unit holders 

under various federal state and local laws an owner or manager of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on the property these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances the cost of any required remediation could exceed the value of the property andor the aggregate assets of the owner or the responsible party the presence of or the failure to properly remediate hazardous or toxic substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a contaminated property or to borrow using the property as collateral any of these developments could reduce cash flow and distributions to stock and unit holders 

compliance with the americans with disabilities act and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that adversely affect our cash flows 

all of our properties are required to comply with the americans with disabilities act “ada” the ada has separate compliance requirements for “public accommodations” and “commercial facilities” but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants or both while the tenants to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions and typically under tenant leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these tenants to cover costs could be adversely affected in addition we are required to operate the properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations as they may be adopted by governmental entities and become applicable to the properties we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with these requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our financial obligations and make distributions to our stock and unit holders 

if we do not maintain the security of tenantrelated information we could incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation 

we are implementing an online payment system where we will receive certain information about our tenants that will depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments a compromise of our security systems that results in information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties in addition a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage our business disruptions in both our primary and secondary backup systems could harm our ability to run our business 

although we have independent redundant and physically separate primary and secondary computer systems it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our businesscritical computer systems our computer systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees if our computer systems and our backup systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in both of our computer systems and backup systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

risk factors related to our coinvestment partnerships and acquisition structure 

we do not have voting control over our joint venture investments so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued 

we have invested as a coventurer in the acquisition or development of properties these investments involve risks not present in a whollyowned project we do not have voting control over the ventures the other coventurer might i have interests or goals that are inconsistent with our interests or goals or ii otherwise impede our objectives the other coventurer also might become insolvent or bankrupt these factors could limit the return that we receive from such investments or cause our cash flows to be lower than our estimates 

our coinvestment partnerships are an important part of our growth strategy the termination of our coinvestment partnerships could adversely affect our cash flow operating results and distributions to stock and unit holders 

our management fee income has increased significantly as our participation in coinvestment partnerships has increased if coinvestment partnerships owning a significant number of properties were dissolved for any reason we would lose the asset and property management fees from these coinvestment partnerships which could adversely affect our operating results and our cash available for distribution to stock and unit holders 

in addition termination of the coinvestment partnerships without replacing them with new coinvestment partnerships could adversely affect our growth strategy property sales to the coinvestment partnerships provide us with an important source of funding for additional developments and acquisitions without this source of capital our ability to recycle capital fund developments and acquisitions and increase distributions to stock and unit holders could be adversely affected 

our coinvestment partnerships have 19 billion of debt as of december 31 2011  of which 136 will mature through 2012 which is subject to significant refinancing risks if real estate values continue to decline the refinancing of maturing loans including those maturing in our joint ventures will require us and our joint venture partners to contribute our respective prorata shares of capital in order to reduce refinancing requirements to acceptable loan to value levels required for new financings 

risk factors related to our capital recycling and capital structure 

higher market capitalization rates for our properties could adversely impact our ability to recycle capital and fund developments and acquisitions and could dilute earnings 

as part of our capital recycling program we sell operating properties that no longer meet our investment standards we also develop certain retail centers because of their attractive margins with the intent of selling them to coinvestment partnerships or other third parties for a profit these sales proceeds are used to fund the construction of new developments an increase in market capitalization rates could cause a reduction in the value of centers identified for sale which would have an adverse impact on our capital recycling program by reducing the amount of cash generated and profits realized in order to meet the cash requirements of our development program we may be required to sell more properties than initially planned which would have a negative impact on our earnings 

we face risks associated with the use of debt to fund our business 

we depend on external financing principally debt financing to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt our access to financing depends on our credit rating the willingness of creditors to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets in addition to finding creditors willing to lend to us we are dependent upon our joint venture partners to contribute their share of any amount needed to repay or refinance existing debt when lenders reduce the amount of debt our joint ventures are eligible to refinance 

without access to external financing we would be required to pay outstanding debt with our operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales our operating cash flows may not be sufficient to pay our outstanding debt as it comes due and real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly at a return we believe is appropriate if we are required to deleverage our business with operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales we may be forced to reduce the amount of or eliminate altogether our distributions to stock and unit holders or refrain from making investments in our business 

our debt financing may reduce distributions to stock and unit holders 

our organizational documents do not limit the amount of debt that we may incur in addition we do not expect to generate sufficient funds from operations to make balloon principal payments on our debt when due if we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms we might be forced i to dispose of properties which might result in losses or ii to obtain financing at unfavorable terms either could reduce the cash flow available for distributions to stock and unit holders if we cannot make required mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose on the property securing the mortgage causing the loss of cash flow from that property 

covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition 

our unsecured notes unsecured term loan unsecured line of credit and revolving credit facility contain customary covenants including compliance with financial ratios such as ratio of total debt to gross asset value and fixed charge coverage ratio fixed charge coverage ratio is defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda dividend by the sum of interest expense and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders our debt arrangements also restrict our ability to enter into a transaction that would result in a change of control these covenants may limit our operational flexibility and our acquisition activities moreover if we breach any of the covenants in our debt agreements and did not cure the breach within the applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately even in the absence of a payment default many of our debt arrangements including our unsecured notes unsecured term loan unsecured line of credit and our revolving credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other material debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our stock 

we depend on external sources of capital which may not be available in the future on favorable terms or at all 

to qualify as a reit the parent company must among other things distribute to its stockholders each year at least 90 of its reit taxable income excluding any net capital gains because of these distribution requirements we likely will not be able to fund all future capital needs including capital for acquisitions or developments with income from operations we therefore will have to rely on thirdparty sources of capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all our access to thirdparty sources of capital depends on a number of things including the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings in addition our existing debt arrangements also impose covenants that limit our flexibility in obtaining other financing such as a prohibition on negative pledge agreements additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders interests and additional debt financing may substantially increase our degree of leverage 

risk factors related to interest rates and the market for our stock 

changes in economic and market conditions could adversely affect the parent companys stock price 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors many of which are out of our control including 

 

these factors may cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of our financial condition results of operations business or prospects it is impossible to ensure that the market price of our common stock will not fall in the future a decrease in the market price of our common stock could reduce our ability to raise additional equity in the public markets selling common stock at a decreased market price would have a dilutive impact on existing stockholders 

risk factors related to federal income tax laws 

if the parent company fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes it would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 

we believe that we qualify for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes and we plan to operate so that we can continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit if we qualify as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on our income that we distribute currently to our stockholders many of the reit requirements however are highly technical and complex the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances some of which may not be totally within our control and some of which involve questions of interpretation for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income must come from specific passive sources like rent that are itemized in the reit tax laws there can be no assurance that the internal revenue service “irs” or a court would agree with the positions we have taken in interpreting the reit requirements we are also required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains the fact that we hold many of our assets through coinvestment partnerships and their subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status furthermore congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult or impossible for us to remain qualified as a reit 

also unless the irs granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we would remain disqualified as a reit for four years following the year we first failed to qualify if we failed to qualify as a reit currently andor with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired we would have to pay significant income taxes reducing cash available to pay dividends which would likely have a significant adverse affect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to pay any dividends to stockholders although we believe that we qualify as a reit we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes 

even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we are required to pay certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from “prohibited transactions” that income will be subject to a 100 tax in general prohibited transactions include sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business the determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale while we have undertaken a significant number of asset sales in 

recent years we do not believe that those sales should be considered prohibited transactions but there can be no assurance that the irs would not contend otherwise 

risk factors related to our ownership limitations and the florida business corporation act 

restrictions on the ownership of the parent companys capital stock to preserve our reit status could delay or prevent a change in control 

ownership of more than 7 by value of our outstanding capital stock is prohibited with certain exceptions by our articles of incorporation for the purpose of maintaining our qualification as a reit this 7 limitation may discourage a change in control and may also i deter tender offers for our capital stock which offers may be attractive to our stockholders or ii limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their capital stock that might otherwise exist if an investor attempted to assemble a block in excess of 7 of our outstanding capital stock or to affect a change in control 

the issuance of the parent companys capital stock could delay or prevent a change in control 

our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to 30000000 shares of preferred stock and 10000000 shares of special common stock and to establish the preferences and rights of any shares issued the issuance of preferred stock or special common stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control the provisions of the florida business corporation act regarding control share acquisitions and affiliated transactions could also deter potential acquisitions by preventing the acquiring party from voting the common stock it acquires or consummating a merger or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of our disinterested stockholders

as of february 28 2012 there were approximately 18000 holders of common equity 

we intend to pay regular quarterly distributions to regency centers corporations common stockholders future distributions will be declared and paid at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon cash generated by operating activities our financial condition capital requirements annual dividend requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended and such other factors as our board of directors deem relevant in order to maintain regency centers corporations qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes we are generally required to make annual distributions at least equal to 90 of our real estate investment trust taxable income for the taxable year under certain circumstances which we do not expect to occur we could be required to make distributions in excess of cash available for distributions in order to meet such requirements the company has a dividend reinvestment plan under which shareholders may elect to reinvest their dividends automatically in common stock under the plan the company may elect to purchase common stock in the open market on behalf of shareholders or may issue new common stock to such shareholders

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview of our strategy 

regency centers corporation began its operations as a reit in 1993 and is the managing general partner in regency centers lp we are focused on achieving total shareholder returns in excess of reit shopping center averages and sustaining growth in our net asset value and our earnings over an extended period of time we work to achieve these goals through owning operating and investing in a highquality portfolio of primarily groceryanchored shopping centers that are leased by marketdominant grocers categoryleading anchors specialty retailers and restaurants located in areas with above average household incomes and population densities all of our operating investing and financing activities are performed through the operating partnership its whollyowned subsidiaries and through its investments in real estate partnerships with third parties also referred to as coinvestment partnerships or joint ventures the parent company currently owns approximately 998  of the outstanding common partnership units of the operating partnership 

at december 31 2011  we directly owned 217  shopping centers the “consolidated properties” located in 24  states representing 238 million  square feet of gross leasable area “gla” through coinvestment partnerships we own partial ownership interests in 147  shopping centers the “unconsolidated properties” located in 24  states and the district of columbia representing 184 million  square feet of gla 

we earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to grocery stores major retail anchors sideshop retailers and restaurants including ground leasing or selling building pads outparcels to these same types of tenants historically we have experienced growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates in our existing shopping centers and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers increasing occupancy in our shopping centers to historical levels and achieving positive rental rate growth are key objectives of our strategic plan 

at december 31 2011  the consolidated operating shopping centers were 931  leased as compared to 926  at december 31 2010  during the recession of 2009 we experienced occupancy declines in our shopping centers which stabilized during 2010 as the economy continued its recovery and increased during 2011 during 2011 we began replacing weaker tenants with financially stronger tenants that we expect will contribute to the overall success of our shopping centers we continue to produce higher levels of new leasing activity and fewer tenant defaults as compared to 2010 and 2009 and moveouts of weaker tenants hurt by the recession appear to be on the decline however economic uncertainties arising in europe could negatively impact the us economy the operations of the tenants in our shopping centers and consequently future operations and cash flows of our shopping centers 

rental rate changes have varied by market during 2011 as certain markets continue to experience a decline in market rates due to previous tenants rental rates being above market while other markets rates are stabilized or increasing we expect this market variability to continue during 2012 during 2011 and 2010 average rental rates from new and renewal leasing in the combined portfolio for spaces vacant less than 12 months grew 12 in 2011 and declined 01 in 2010 we expect average 2012 rental rates from new and renewal leases to decline or grow in a range of 10 to 25 

we continue to closely monitor the operating performance and rent collections of all tenants in our shopping centers especially those tenants operating retail formats that are experiencing significant changes in competition business practice and store closings in other locations we also evaluate consumer preferences shopping behaviors and demographics to anticipate both challenges and opportunities in the changing retail industry that may effect our tenants 

we continue to monitor tenants who have cotenancy clauses in their lease agreements these tenants are typically located in larger format community shopping centers that contain multiple anchor tenants whose leases contain these types of clauses cotenancy clauses have several variants they may allow a tenant to postpone a store opening if certain other tenants fail to open their store they may allow a tenant the opportunity to close their store prior to lease expiration if another tenant closes their store prior to lease expiration or more commonly they may allow a tenant to pay reduced levels of rent until a certain number of tenants open their stores within the same shopping center as economic weakness persists in geographic areas where we have centers that contain leases with these types of clauses we could experience reductions in rent and occupancy related to tenants exercising their cotenancy clauses 

we grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions of operating centers and new shopping center development we will continue to use our unique combination of development capabilities market presence and anchor relationships to invest in valueadded opportunities sourced from land owners and joint venture partners the redevelopment of existing centers and the development of land development is customer driven meaning we generally have an executed lease 

from the anchor before we start construction developments serve the growth needs of our anchors and specialty retailers resulting in modern shopping centers with longterm anchor leases that produce attractive returns on our invested capital this development process typically requires three to five years from initial land or redevelopment acquisition through construction leaseup and stabilization of rental income but can take longer depending upon tenant demand for new stores and the size of the project we fund our acquisition and development activity from various capital sources including new debt equity and through capital recycling capital recycling involves identifying nonstrategic assets from our real estate portfolio and selling those in the open market and reinvesting the sale proceeds into new higher quality developments and acquisitions that will generate sustainable revenue growth and attractive returns 

coinvestment partnerships provide us with an additional capital source for shopping center acquisitions as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset management property management and other investing and financing services as asset manager we are engaged by our partners to apply similar operating investment and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the coinvestment partnerships as those applied to the portfolio that we whollyown coinvestment partnerships grow their shopping center investments through acquisitions from third parties or direct purchases from us although selling properties to coinvestment partnerships reduces our direct ownership interest it provides a source of capital that further strengthens our balance sheet while we continue to share to the extent of our ownership interest in the risks and rewards of shopping centers that meet our high quality standards and longterm investment strategy 

shopping center portfolio 

the following table summarizes general information related to the consolidated properties in our shopping center portfolio 



the following table summarizes general information related to the unconsolidated properties owned in coinvestment partnerships in our shopping center portfolio 



we seek to reduce our operating and leasing risks through diversification which we achieve by geographically diversifying our shopping centers avoiding dependence on any single property market or tenant and owning a portion of our shopping centers through coinvestment partnerships 

the following table summarizes our four largest tenants each of which is a grocery tenant occupying our shopping centers at december 31 2011    



although base rent is supported by longterm lease contracts tenants who file bankruptcy have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues we are closely monitoring industry trends and sales data to help us identify declines in retail categories or tenants who might be experiencing financial difficulties as a result of slowing sales lack of credit changes in retail formats or increased competition as a result of our findings we may reduce new leasing suspend leasing or curtail the allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements within a certain retail category or to a specific retailer 

we continuously monitor the financial condition of our tenants we communicate often with those tenants who have announced store closings or filed bankruptcy we are not currently aware of the pending bankruptcy or announced store closings of any tenants in our shopping centers that would individually cause a material reduction in our revenues and no tenant represents more than 5 of our annual base rent on a prorata basis 

blockbuster video represents our largest tenant currently in bankruptcy as of february 1 2012 we had 17 leases with blockbuster in the combined portfolio 16 leases of which expire in 2012 assuming these stores continue through their lease expiration date we would expect to receive base rent of approximately 503000 during 2012 including our pro rata share of those leases in the unconsolidated properties 

liquidity and capital resources 

our parent company has no capital commitments other than its guarantees of the commitments of our operating partnership the parent company will from time to time access the capital markets for the purpose of issuing new equity and will simultaneously contribute all of the offering proceeds to the operating partnership in exchange for additional partnership units all debt is issued by our operating partnership or by our coinvestment partnerships accordingly the discussion below regarding liquidity and capital resources is presented on a prorata basis for the company the following table summarizes net cash flows related to operating investing and financing activities of the company for the years  ended december 31 2011  2010  and 2009  in thousands   



on december 31 2011  our cash balance was 114 million  we operate our business such that we expect net cash provided by operating activities before the effect of the derivative instruments settled in 2010 and 2009 and funded through financing activity will provide the necessary funds to pay our scheduled mortgage loan principal payments capital expenditures necessary to maintain our shopping centers and distributions to our share and unit holders 

the following table summarizes these amounts for the years  ended december 31 2011  2010  and 2009  in thousands

we endeavor to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets at december 31 2011  797 of our real estate assets were unencumbered such assets allow us to access the secured and unsecured debt markets and to maintain significant availability on our 6000 million unsecured line of credit “the line” our debt to asset ratio before the effect of accumulated depreciation including our prorata share of the debt and assets of joint ventures is 450 at december 31 2011  a decline from our ratio at december 31 2010  of 481 due to the settlement of our forward sale agreements forward equity offering in march 2011 our coverage ratio including our prorata share of our partnerships was 23 times for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to 21 times for the year ended december 31 2010  we define our coverage ratio as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” divided by the sum of the gross interest and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders 

at december 31 2011  commitments available to us under the line totaled 6000 million which had an outstanding balance of 400 million  the line was renewed in september 2011 and now matures in september 2015 in february 2011 a 1138 million revolving credit facility expired with no balance outstanding and we did not renew this facility on november 17 2011 the company closed on a 250 million unsecured term loan agreement term loan which matures in december 2016 and had no outstanding balance as of december 31 2011  

on january 15 2011 1617 million of unsecured debt matured and we repaid the maturity by borrowing on the line on march 9 2011 we received net proceeds of 2154 million from the settlement of the 80 million common share forward equity offering and used a portion of the proceeds to payoff the balance of the line during 2012 we estimate that we will require approximately 3022 million primarily to repay 1924 million of maturing debt excluding scheduled principal payments and 1098 million for inprocess development costs and capital contributions to our coinvestment partnerships for repayment of debt to meet these cash requirements we plan to use funds from our existing line and term loan and when the capital markets are favorable by issuing long term fixed rate debt and common equity in january 2012 we borrowed 150 million on the term loan and in combination with proceeds drawn on the line repaid 1924 million unsecured debt maturing january 15 2012 a more detailed schedule about our maturing loans is included below under contractual obligations 

during 2011 we acquired five shopping centers for 1106 million including our pro rata share of acquisitions completed by our coinvestment partnerships although we may fund acquisitions from various capital sources a primary source of funds would come from capital recycling by selling shopping centers that no longer meet our investment criteria during 2011 we sold 13 shopping centers for 912 million including our pro rata share of sales completed by our coinvestment partnerships relying on property sales as a substantial capital source to fund our acquisition program is subject to numerous risks including the inherent difficulties in selling properties in the current market or selling properties at higher initial returns than planned thereby limiting our ability to source the necessary funds to acquire dominate infill shopping centers consistent with our capital recycling strategy capital recycling may also be dilutive to our earnings given that dominate infill shopping centers that we would target for acquisition may have lower initial returns than many of the properties that we would target for sale 

at december 31 2011  we had seven development properties that were either under construction or in lease up which when completed will represent a net investment of 1613 million after projected sales of adjacent land and outparcels this compares to 26 development properties at december 31 2010  representing an investment of 5306 million upon completion we estimate that we will earn an average return on investment from our current development projects of 76 when completed and fully leased costs necessary to complete inprocess development projects net of reimbursements and projected land sales are estimated to be 726 million 

during 2011  the coinvestment partnerships repaid 4847 million of debt through new mortgage loan financings and partner capital contributions at december 31 2011  our joint ventures had 2556 million  of scheduled secured mortgage loans and credit lines maturing in 2012 these maturities will be repaid from proceeds from new mortgage loan financings of 1280 million currently committed 56 million expected refinancing and 1220 million of partner capital contributions of which regencys pro rata share is 446 million 

we believe that our joint venture partners are financially sound and have sufficient capital or access thereto to fund future capital requirements we communicate with our coinvestment partners regularly regarding the operating and capital budgets of our coinvestment partnerships and believe that we will successfully complete the refinancing of our joint venture debt as it matures in the future in the event that a coinvestment partner was unable to fund its share of the capital requirements of the coinvestment partnership we would have the right but not the obligation to loan the defaulting partner the amount of its capital call at an interest rate at the lesser of prime plus a predefined spread or the maximum rate allowed by law a decision to loan to a defaulting joint venture partner which would be secured by the defaulting partners partnership interest would be based on the fair value of the coinvestment partnership assets our joint venture partners financial health and would be subject to an evaluation of our own capital commitments and sources to fund those commitments alternatively should we determine that our joint venture partners will not have sufficient capital to meet future capital needs we could trigger liquidation of the partnership for the coinvestment partnerships that have distributioninkind “dik” provisions and own multiple properties a liquidation of the coinvestment partnership could be completed by either a dik of the properties to each joint venture partner in proportion to its partnership interest open market sale or a combination of both methods our coinvestment partnership properties have been financed with nonrecourse loans that represent 100 of the total debt of the coinvestment partnerships including lines of credit as of december 31 2011  we and our partners have no guarantees related to these loans in those coinvestment partnerships which have dik provisions if we trigger liquidation by dik each partner would receive title to properties selected in a rotation process for distribution and would assume any related loans secured by the properties distributed the loan agreements generally provide for assumption by either joint venture partner after obtaining any required lender consent we would only be responsible for those loans we assume through the dik and only to the extent of the value of the property we receive since after assumption through the dik the loans would remain nonrecourse

critical accounting policies and estimates 

knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial statements the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities at a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period these accounting estimates are based upon but not limited to our judgments about historical results current economic activity and industry accounting standards they are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness however the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates 

accounts receivable   

minimum rent percentage rent and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs insurance and real estate taxes are the companys principal source of revenue as a result of generating this revenue we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants we are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that may affect the collection of outstanding receivables to address the collectability of these receivables we analyze historical writeoff experience tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts although we estimate uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income actual experience may differ from those estimates 

real estate and longlived assets 

acquisition of real estate assets 

upon acquisition of real estate operating properties the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land building building improvements and tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and belowmarket leases inplace leases and tenant relationships assumed debt and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date based on these estimates the company allocates the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities fair value is determined based on an exit price approach which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date if up to one year from the acquisition date information regarding fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation on a retrospective basis the company expenses transaction costs associated with business combinations in the period incurred 

  

cost capitalization 

we capitalize the acquisition of land the construction of buildings and other specifically identifiable development costs incurred by recording them into properties in development in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets in summary a project changes from nonoperating to operating when it is substantially completed and held available for occupancy at that time costs are no longer capitalized other development costs include predevelopment costs essential to the development of the property as well as interest real estate taxes and direct employee costs incurred during the development period predevelopment costs are incurred prior to land acquisition during the due diligence phase and include contract deposits legal engineering and other professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center at december 31 2011  and 2010  the company had capitalized predevelopment costs of 21 million  and 899000  respectively of which 10 million  and 840000  respectively were refundable deposits if we determine that the development of a specific project undergoing due diligence is no longer probable we immediately expense all related capitalized predevelopment costs not considered recoverable during the years ended december 31 2011  2010  and 2009  we expensed predevelopment costs of approximately 241000  520000  and 38 million  respectively recorded in other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations interest costs are capitalized into each development project based on applying our weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the actual development costs expended we cease interest cost capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements but in no event would we capitalize interest on the project beyond 12 months after substantial completion of the building shell during the years ended december 31 2011  2010  and 2009  we capitalized interest of 15 million 51 million and 191 million respectively on our development projects we have a staff of employees who directly support our development program all direct internal costs attributable to these development activities are capitalized as part of each development project during the years ended december 31 2011  2010  and 2009  we capitalized 55 million 27 million and 65 million respectively of direct internal costs incurred to support our development program the capitalization of costs is directly related to the actual level of development activity occurring if accounting standards issued in the future were to limit the amount of internal costs that may be capitalized we could incur additional increases in general and administrative 

expenses which would further reduce net income 

valuation of real estate assets 

we evaluate whether there are any indicators including property operating performance and general market conditions that the value of the real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may not be recoverable through the evaluation we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset our estimated cash flows is based on several key assumptions including rental rates costs of tenant improvements leasing commissions anticipated hold period and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition including the exit capitalization rate these key assumptions are subjective in nature and could differ materially from actual results to the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the companys financial condition or operating performance 

the fair value of real estate assets is highly subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the traditional discounted cash flow approach such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other factors and therefore are subject to a significant degree of management judgment and changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land we generally use market data and comparable sales information

we evaluate our real estate investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable which may result in a reduction in the carrying value of the asset to its fair value a provision for impairment was recognized during the year ended december 31 2011  of 138 million  related primarily to two operating properties these properties exhibited weak operating fundamentals including low economic occupancy for an extended period of time which lead to the impairment

generally leased percentages were unchanged between 2010 and 2009 and as such minimum rent remained relatively consistent only increasing slightly from 2009 to 2010 declines in percentage rent were a result of the change in percentage rent lease terms due to the increase in minimum rent for certain leases upon their renewal the increase in recoveries from tenants and other income resulted from a significant increase in termination fees received during 2010 related to tenant operators negotiating an early end to their lease agreements as well as higher operating and real estate tax expenses

asset management fees which are tied to the value of the real estate we manage for our coinvestment partners decreased in 2010 due to an overall decline in commercial real estate values but was also a result of the liquidation of a joint venture with mcw that occurred in 2009 as well as our increased ownership and revised agreements in the grir joint venture which resulted in lower fees paid to us by our partner transaction fees decreased primarily as a result of the 78 million disposition fee we received from charter hall retail reit “chrr” in 2009 equal to 1 of the gross sales price paid by gri described below leasing commissions decreased as a result of our increased ownership in the grir joint venture which resulted in a reduction of fee recognized 

our operating expenses increased by 101 million  or 34 to 3103 million  in 2010  as compared to 2009  the following table summarizes our operating expenses in thousands   



  

increases in depreciation and amortization expense along with operating maintenance and real estate tax expense are primarily related to the recently completed developments commencing operations in the current year and general increases in expenses incurred by the operating properties the majority of these cost increases are recoverable from our tenants and included in our revenues general and administrative expenses increased as a result of higher levels of compensation earned in 2010 for higher levels of performance as compared to 2009 provision for doubtful accounts decreased in 2010 as compared to 2009 due to significantly improved tenant collection rates and fewer tenant defaults the decrease in other expenses is due to a 13 million tax benefit incurred in 2010 as compared to tax expense of 18 million incurred in 2009 as well as a reduction in 

predevelopment costs written off as a result of pursuing less new development activity during 2010 

the following table presents the change in interest expense in thousands   



interest on line of credit decreased as a result of lower outstanding balances during 2010 as compared to 2009 capitalized interest decreased as a result of a reduced development activity as compared to 2009 and a higher level of shopping center completions during 2010 

a provision for impairment was recognized during the year ended december 31 2010 of 266 million  which was a decrease of 709 million from the impairment provision recorded in 2009 the impairment provision recorded in 2010 was a result of identifying properties that had been previously considered held for long term investment and determining that they no longer met our long term investment strategy as a result of this reevaluation we changed our expected investment holding period and reduced our carrying value to estimated fair value during 2009 we recorded a provision for impairment of 1044 million of which 937 million related to land held for future development or sale during 2009 a prospective anchor tenant for several development sites expressed considerable uncertainty about the timing and location of future stores given the recession occurring during that period as a result we reevaluated and reduced the probability of future development at these sites and accordingly reduced our carrying value in the land parcels to estimated fair value of the land included in the impairment provision recorded during 2009 were operating properties that were subjected to the same investment criteria evaluation that we applied during 2010 and we accordingly reduced our carrying value on those properties to estimated fair value based upon a change in expected holding periods if we sell a property or classify a property as heldforsale we are required to reclassify its operations into discontinued operations for all prior periods which results in a reclassification of amounts previously reported as continuing operations into discontinued operations all of the 266 million provision was recorded in continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2010 and of the 1044 million provision recorded during the year ended december 31 2009 69 million was reclassified into discontinued operations 

during the year ended december 31 2010 we sold eleven outparcels for net proceeds of 118 million and recognized a gain of approximately 661000 as compared to 2009 where we sold 18 outparcels for net proceeds of 278 million and recognized a gain of approximately 219000 during 2010 we recognized approximately 332000 in contingent gains related to three properties sold to the usaa partnership during 2009 during 2009 we sold eight operating properties to the usaa partnership for net proceeds of 1033 million and recognized gains of 191 million recorded under the restricted gain method as further described in note 1 significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements

the change in our equity loss in investments in real estate partnerships compared to 2009 is related to increasing our ownership interest in grir effective january 1 2010 to 40 from our 2495 ownership interest in 2009 combined with similar positive trends that we experienced in the consolidated properties as they relate to increases in base rent reductions in provisions for doubtful accounts higher termination fees and lower provisions for impairment during 2010 our prorata share of the impairment reserves recorded in the real estate partnerships was 230 million as compared to 261 million in 2009 during 2009 impairment provisions were primarily incurred and recorded by grir however during 2010 impairment provisions which were significantly lower in grir and contributed to grir’s reduction in equity loss were higher in columbia i and the fund which contributed to the equity losses reported by these two partnerships in 2010

environmental matters 

we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers and underground petroleum storage tanks we believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations generally we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to nonchlorinated solvent systems where available we have applied and been accepted into statesponsored environmental programs we have a blanket environmental insurance policy for thirdparty liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination we have also placed environmental insurance where possible on specific properties with known contamination in order to mitigate our environmental risk we monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites we also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so we estimate the cost associated with these legal obligations to be 24 million  and 29 million  all of which has been accrued as of december 31 2011  and 2010  respectively we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations however we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities that any previous owner occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants by the condition of nearby properties or by unrelated third parties or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us

inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers however more recent data suggests inflation will eventually become a greater concern as the economy continues to recover from the recent recession substantially all of our longterm leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation such provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rent based on tenants gross sales which generally increase as prices rise andor escalation clauses which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices in addition many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years which permits us to seek increased rents upon rerental at market rates most of our leases require tenants to pay their prorata share of operating expenses including commonarea maintenance real estate taxes insurance and utilities thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation however during deflationary periods or periods of economic weakness minimum rents and percentage rents will decline as the supply of available retail space exceeds demand and consumer spending declines occupancy declines resulting from a weak economic period will also likely result in lower recovery rates of our operating expenses 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

we are exposed to two significant components of interest rate risk we have a 6000 million unsecured line of credit the line commitment and a 2500 million unsecured term loan the term loan commitment as further described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements our line commitment has a variable interest rate that is based upon a variable interest rate of libor plus 125 basis points  and our term loan has a variable interest rate of libor plus 145 basis points libor rates charged on our line commitment and our term loan collectively our unsecured credit facilities change monthly the spread on the unsecured credit facilities is dependent upon maintaining specific credit ratings if our credit ratings are downgraded the spread on the unsecured credit facilities would increase resulting in higher interest costs we are also exposed to changes in   interest rates when we refinance our existing longterm fixed rate debt the objective of our interest rate risk management is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we borrow primarily at fixed interest rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps caps or treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes our interest rate swaps are structured solely for the purpose of interest rate protection 

during 2006 we entered into four forwardstarting interest rate swaps the “swaps” totaling 3967 million with fixed rates of 5399 5415 5399 and 5415 at inception we designated these swaps as cash flow hedges to lock in the underlying treasury rates on 4000 million of fixed rate financing that was expected to occur in 2010 and 2011 during 2009 we paid 200 million to partially settle 1060 million of the 3967 swaps in place to hedge the 1060 million 

mortgage loan issued on july 1 2009 on june 1 2010 we paid 268 million to partially settle 1500 million of the remaining 2907 million swaps in place to hedge the 1500 million tenyear senior unsecured notes issued on june 2 2010 on september 30 2010 we paid 367 million to settle the remaining 1407 million of swaps to hedge the 2500 million tenyear senior unsecured notes issued on october 7 2010 during 2011  the company through a consolidated coinvestment partnership entered an interest rate swap on a 90 million  variable rate secured loan maturing on september 1 2014  to fix the interest rate for the years ended december 31 2011  and 2010  we recognized expense of 54000  and income of 14 million  respectively for changes in hedge ineffectiveness 

we have 2087 million  of fixed rate debt maturing in 2012 and 2013 that has a weighted average fixed interest rate of 678 which includes 1924 million  of unsecured longterm debt that matures in january 2012 we continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt to repay maturing debt or fund our commitments based upon the current capital markets our current credit ratings our current capacity under our line and term loan and the number of high quality unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings we expect that we will be able to successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund these debt obligations in january 2012 we borrowed the on our line and term loan to repay the 1924 million unsecured debt maturing in january 2012 

our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the table below presents the principal cash flows in thousands weighted average interest rates of remaining debt and the fair value of total debt in thousands as of december 31 2011  by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes although the average interest rate for variable rate debt is included in the table those rates represent rates that existed at december 31 2011  and are subject to change on a monthly basis 

the table below incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2011  and does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date since firm commitments are not presented the table has limited predictive value as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at that time and actual interest rates

 item 1 business tableend regency centers corporation began its operations as a real estate investment trust “reit” in 1993 and is the managing general partner in regency centers lp the term “the company” or “regency” means the parent company and the operating partnership collectively our key strategic goals are focused on producing superior results for our shareholders by achieving total shareholder returns in excess of reit shopping center averages and sustaining growth in our net asset value and our earnings over an extended period of time we will achieve these goals by investing in and operating a highquality portfolio of primarily groceryanchored shopping centers that are tenanted by marketdominant grocers categoryleading anchors specialty retailers and restaurants located in areas with above average household incomes and population densities 

at december 31 2010 we directly owned 215 shopping centers located in 23 states representing 233 million square feet of gross leasable area “gla” through coinvestment partnerships we own partial ownership interests in 181 shopping centers located in 25 states and the district of columbia representing 218 million square feet of gla the shopping center portfolio that we manage on a “combined basis” total of consolidated and unconsolidated properties represents 396 shopping centers located in 28 states and the district of columbia and contains 451 million square feet of gla 

we earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to grocery stores major retail anchors sideshop retailers and restaurants including ground leasing or selling building pads outparcels to these same types of tenants historically we have experienced growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates in our shopping centers although both of these important operating metrics declined during 2009 and 2010 as a result of the recession the economy appears to be recovering and we are intensely focused on returning these metrics to historic levels our shopping centers generate substantial daily traffic by conveniently offering necessities and services this high traffic should generate increased sales to our tenants and attract new tenants to our shopping centers thereby driving higher occupancy levels and rentalrate growth 

we seek a range of strong national regional and local specialty retailers for the same reason that we choose to anchor our centers with leading grocers and major retailers who provide a mix of goods and services that meet consumer needs we have created a formal partnering process the premier customer initiative “pci” to promote mutually beneficial relationships with our sideshop retailers the objective of pci is for us to build a 

  

index to financial statements base of nonanchor tenants who represent the “bestinclass” operators in their respective merchandising categories such retailers reinforce the consumer appeal and other strengths of a center’s anchor help grow and stabilize a center’s occupancy reduce releasing downtime reduce tenant turnover and yield higher sustainable rents 

we grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions of operating centers and shopping center development we will continue to use our unique combination of development capabilities market presence and anchor relationships to invest in valueadded opportunities sourced from land owners and joint venture partners the redevelopment of existing centers developing land that we already own and other opportunities development is customer driven and serves the growth needs of our anchors and specialty retailers resulting in new modern shopping centers with longterm anchor leases that produce attractive returns on our invested capital 

maintaining a high quality portfolio also involves identifying and selling assets that are at risk of not achieving our longterm investment goals proceeds from these sales are targeted for reinvestment into higher quality new development redevelopment of existing centers or acquisitions that will generate sustainable revenue growth and higher returns 

we also invest in real estate partnerships these coinvestment partnerships provide us with a reliable capital source for shopping center acquisitions as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset management property management and other investing and financing services as asset manager we are engaged by our partners to apply similar operating investment and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the coinvestment partnerships as those applied to the portfolio that we whollyown coinvestment partnerships also grow their shopping center investments through acquisitions from third parties or direct purchases from us 

we have implemented a greengenuity program envisioned to improve our environmental sustainability to date we have received leed leadership in energy and environmental design certifications by the us green building council on three shopping centers and we are targeting five additional shopping centers for certification we also continue to install network lighting controls and smart irrigation controllers that will reduce our power and water consumption in addition to other sustainability initiatives it is our intent to be one of the leaders in the design construction and operation of environmentally efficient shopping centers that will contribute to our key strategic goals 

competition 

we are among the largest owners of shopping centers in the nation based on revenues number of properties gross leasable area and market capitalization there are numerous companies and private individuals engaged in the ownership development acquisition and operation of shopping centers which compete with us in our targeted markets including grocery store chains that also anchor some of our shopping centers this results in competition for attracting anchor tenants as well as the acquisition of existing shopping centers and new development sites we believe that the principal competitive factors in attracting tenants in our market areas are competitive infill locations above average trade area demographics rental costs tenant mix property age and property maintenance we believe that our competitive advantages are driven by our locations within our market areas the design and high quality of our shopping centers the strong demographics surrounding our shopping centers our relationships with our anchor tenants and our sideshop and outparcel retailers our pci program that allows us to efficiently provide retailers with multiple locations our practice of maintaining and renovating our shopping centers and our ability to source and develop new shopping centers 

changes in policies 

our board of directors establishes the policies that govern our investment and operating strategies including among others development and acquisition of shopping centers tenant and market focus debt and equity financing policies quarterly distributions to stock and unit holders and reit tax status the board of directors may amend these policies at any time without a vote of our stockholders 

  

index to financial statements employees 

our headquarters are located at one independent drive suite 114 jacksonville florida we presently maintain 17 market offices nationwide where we conduct management leasing construction and investment activities at december 31 2010 we had 392 employees and we believe that our relations with our employees are good 

compliance with governmental regulations 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate certain hazardous or toxic substances at our shopping centers these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances the cost of required remediation and the owner’s liability for remediation could exceed the value of the property andor the aggregate assets of the owner the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral we have a number of properties that could require or are currently undergoing varying levels of environmental remediation environmental remediation is not currently expected to have a material financial impact on us due to reserves for remediation insurance programs designed to mitigate the cost of remediation and various stateregulated programs that shift the responsibility and cost to the state

 item 1a risk factors tableend risk factors related to our industry and real estate investments 

our revenues and cash flow could be adversely affected by poor market conditions where our properties are geographically concentrated 

the economic conditions in markets in which our properties are concentrated greatly influence our financial performance during the year ended december 31 2010 our properties in california florida and texas accounted for 326 143 and 134 respectively of our consolidated net operating income our revenues and cash available for distribution to stock and unit holders could be adversely affected by this geographic concentration if market conditions such as supply of retail space or demand for shopping centers deteriorate in california florida and texas relative to other geographic areas 

loss of revenues from major tenants could reduce distributions to stock and unit holders 

we derive significant revenues from anchor tenants such as kroger publix and safeway which are our three largest anchor tenants and accounted for 44 44 and 38 respectively of our annualized base rent on a prorata basis for the year ended december 31 2010 distributions to stock and unit holders could be adversely affected by the loss of revenues in the event a major tenant 

 

  

  

  

  

 vacated anchor space including space owned by the anchor can reduce rental revenues generated by the shopping center because of the loss of the departed anchor tenant’s customer drawing power most anchors have the right to vacate and prevent retenanting by paying rent for the balance of the lease term if major tenants vacate a property then other tenants may be entitled to terminate their leases at the property 

our net income depends on the success and continued presence of our tenants 

our net income could be adversely affected if we fail to lease significant portions of our new developments or in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of any anchors or of a significant number of our nonanchor tenants within a shopping center the adverse impact on our net income may be greater than the loss of rent from the resulting unoccupied space because cotenancy clauses may allow other tenants to modify or terminate their rent or lease obligations cotenancy clauses have several variants they may allow a tenant to postpone a store opening if certain other tenants fail to open their stores they may allow a tenant the opportunity to close its store prior to lease expiration if another tenant closes its store prior to lease expiration or more commonly they may allow a tenant to pay reduced levels of rent until a certain number of tenants open their stores within the same shopping center 

  

index to financial statements we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy 

at any point in time we generally have one or more tenants in bankruptcy a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not continue to pay us rent a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect prebankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor or its property unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so a tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims it holds if at all 

downturns in the retail industry likely will have a direct adverse impact on our revenues and cash flow 

our properties consist primarily of groceryanchored shopping centers our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space the market for retail space has been or could be adversely affected by any of the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 to the extent that any of these conditions occur they are likely to impact market rents for retail space occupancy in the operating portfolios our ability to recycle capital and our cash available for distributions to stock and unit holders 

our real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges 

our longlived assets primarily real estate held for investment are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted in addition we perform an annual review generally during the fourth quarter to reevaluate marketbased capitalization rates and estimated holding periods if we determine that the carrying amount of a property is not recoverable we write down the asset to fair value if as a result of a change in our strategy for a specific property which we own directly or through our coinvestment partnerships a property previously classified as held and used is changed to held for sale or if its estimated holding period changes such change could cause us to determine that the 

  

index to financial statements property is impaired and a provision for impairment in relation to that property would be recorded by us either directly or through a reduction of our equity in income of real estate partnerships a property’s value is impaired only if our estimate of the aggregate future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges to be generated by the property are less than the carrying value of the property if the aggregate future cash flows are less than the carrying value of property we write down the property to its fair value in our estimate of cash flows we consider factors such as expected future operating income trends and prospects the effects of demand competition and other factors these subjective assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment charge results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income there can be no assurance that we will not take additional charges in the future related to the impairment of our assets any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the charge is taken 

adverse global market and economic conditions may adversely affect us and could cause us to recognize additional impairment charges or otherwise harm our performance 

we are unable to predict the timing severity and length of adverse market and economic conditions the return of adverse market and economic conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flow to pay expenses maintain properties pay distributions to our stock and unit holders and refinance debt during these adverse periods there may be significant uncertainty in the valuation our properties and investments that could result in a substantial decrease in the value thereof no assurance can be given that we would be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our properties and investments in the future our failure to do so would require us to recognize additional impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion which could materially and adversely affect us and the market price of our common stock 

unsuccessful development activities or a slowdown in development activities will have a direct impact on our revenues and our revenue growth 

we actively pursue development activities as opportunities arise development activities require various government and other approvals for entitlements which can significantly delay the development process we may not recover our investment in development projects for which approvals are not received we incur other risks associated with development activities including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if our developments are unsuccessful or we experience a slowdown in development activities our revenue growth may be adversely impacted 

  

  

index to financial statements we may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or releasing space 

we derive most of our revenue directly or indirectly from rent received from our tenants we are subject to the risks that upon expiration or termination of leases whether by their terms as a result of a tenant bankruptcy or otherwise leases for space in our properties may not be renewed space may not be released or the terms of renewal or release including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable than current lease terms as a result our results of operations and our net income could be reduced 

many real estate costs are fixed even if income from our properties decreases 

our financial results depend primarily on leasing space in our properties to tenants on terms favorable to us costs associated with real estate investment such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs generally are not reduced even when a property is not fully occupied rental rates decrease or other circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property as a result cash flow from the operations of our properties may be reduced if a tenant does not pay its rent or we are unable to lease our properties on favorable terms under those circumstances we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal costs additionally new properties that we may acquire or develop may not produce any significant revenue immediately and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with such new properties until they are fully leased 

we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly we may not be able to alter our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions including being unable to sell a property at a return we believe is appropriate due to the current economic environment our inability to respond quickly to adverse changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our stock and unit holders 

changes in accounting standards may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

the sec may decide in 2011 that issuers in the united states should be required to prepare financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards “ifrs” instead of us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” ifrs is a comprehensive set of accounting standards promulgated by the international accounting standards board “iasb” which are rapidly gaining worldwide acceptance if the sec decides to require ifrs us issuers may report under the new standards beginning as early as 2015 changes in us gaap and changes in current interpretations are beyond our control can be hard to predict and could materially impact how we report our financial results and condition in certain cases we could be required to apply a new or revised rule retroactively or apply existing rules differently which may adversely impact our results of operations or result in our recasting prior period financial statements for material amounts additionally significant changes to us gaap may require costly technology changes additional training and personnel and other expenses that will negatively impact our results of operations 

the adoption of new lease accounting rules may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

the financial accounting standards board “fasb” has proposed new accounting rules which could result in significant changes in the way leases are reported in our financial statements under gaap the proposal if adopted could have a significant effect on our balance sheet fasb may issue final rules on this topic in 2011 at this time we are unable to determine what effect if any the adoption of this proposal will have on our financial condition our results of operations and our financial ratios required by our debt covenants 

  

index to financial statements an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the insurance policies on our properties could subject us to loss of capital or revenue on those properties 

we carry comprehensive liability fire flood extended coverage rental loss and environmental insurance for our properties with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties we believe that the insurance carried on our properties is adequate and in accordance with industry standards there are however some types of losses such as from hurricanes terrorism wars or earthquakes which may be uninsurable or the cost of insuring against such losses may not be economically justifiable in addition tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons or damage to personal or real property on or off the premises due to activities conducted by tenants or their agents on the properties including without limitation any environmental contamination and at the tenant’s expense to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease liability and property damage insurance policies however our tenants may not properly maintain their insurance policies or have the ability to pay the deductibles associated with such policies should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from one or more of the properties which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition as well as our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders 

loss of our key personnel could adversely affect the value of our performance and our parent company’s stock price 

we depend on the efforts of our key executive personnel although we believe qualified replacements could be found for our key executives the loss of their services could adversely affect performance and our parent company’s stock price 

we face competition from numerous sources 

the ownership of shopping centers is highly fragmented with less than 10 owned by reit’s we face competition from other reit’s as well as from numerous small owners in the acquisition ownership and leasing of shopping centers we compete to develop shopping centers with other real estate investment trusts engaged in development activities as well as with local regional and national real estate developers 

we compete for the acquisition of properties through proprietary research that identifies opportunities in markets with high barriers to entry and higherthanaverage population growth and household income we seek to maximize rents per square foot by i establishing relationships with supermarket chains that are first or second in their markets or other categoryleading anchors and ii leasing nonanchor space in multiple centers to national or regional tenants we compete to develop properties by applying our proprietary research methods to identify development and leasing opportunities and by preleasing a significant portion of a center before beginning construction 

there can be no assurance however that other real estate owners or developers will not utilize similar research methods and target the same markets and anchor tenants these entities may successfully control these markets and tenants to our exclusion if we cannot successfully compete in our targeted markets our cash flow and therefore distributions to stock and unit holders may be adversely affected 

costs of environmental remediation could reduce our cash flow available for distribution to stock and unit holders 

under various federal state and local laws an owner or manager of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on the property these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances the cost of any required remediation could exceed the value of the property andor the aggregate assets of the owner or the responsible party 

  

index to financial statements we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers and underground petroleum storage tanks ust’s the presence of or the failure to properly remediate hazardous or toxic substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a contaminated property or to borrow using the property as collateral any of these developments could reduce cash flow and distributions to stock and unit holders 

compliance with the americans with disabilities act and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that adversely affect our cash flows 

all of our properties are required to comply with the americans with disabilities act “ada” the ada has separate compliance requirements for “public accommodations” and “commercial facilities” but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants or both while the tenants to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions and typically under tenant leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these tenants to cover costs could be adversely affected as a result we could be required to expend funds to comply with the provisions of the ada which could adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition and our ability to make distributions to our stock and unit holders in addition we are required to operate the properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations as they may be adopted by governmental entities and become applicable to the properties we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our financial obligations and make distributions to our stock and unit holders 

risk factors related to our coinvestment partnerships and acquisition structure 

we do not have voting control over our joint venture investments so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued 

we have invested as a coventurer in the acquisition or development of properties these investments involve risks not present in a whollyowned project we do not have voting control over the ventures the other coventurer might i have interests or goals that are inconsistent with our interests or goals or ii otherwise impede our objectives the other coventurer also might become insolvent or bankrupt 

our coinvestment partnerships are an important part of our growth strategy the termination of our coinvestment partnerships could adversely affect distributions to stock and unit holders 

our management fee income has increased significantly as our participation in coinvestment partnerships has increased if coinvestment partnerships owning a significant number of properties were dissolved for any reason we would lose the asset and property management fees from these coinvestment partnerships which could adversely affect our cash available for distribution to stock and unit holders 

in addition termination of the coinvestment partnerships without replacing them with new coinvestment partnerships could adversely affect our growth strategy property sales to the coinvestment partnerships provide us with an important source of funding for additional developments and acquisitions without this source of capital our ability to recycle capital fund developments and acquisitions and increase distributions to stock and unit holders could be adversely affected 

our coinvestment partnerships have 21 billion of debt as of december 31 2010 of which 350 will mature through 2012 which is subject to significant refinancing risks we anticipate that as real estate values decline the refinancing of maturing loans including those maturing in our joint ventures will require us and our 

  

index to financial statements joint venture partners to contribute our respective prorata shares of capital in order to reduce refinancing requirements to acceptable loan to value levels required for new financings the longterm impact of the current economic crisis on our ability to access capital including access by our joint venture partners or to obtain future financing to fund maturing debt is unclear 

our partnership structure may limit our flexibility to manage our assets 

we invest in retail shopping centers through the operating partnership in which the parent company currently owns approximately 998 of the outstanding common partnership units from time to time we have acquired properties through the operating partnership in exchange for limited partnership interests this acquisition structure may permit limited partners who contribute properties to us to defer some if not all of the income tax liability that they would incur if they sold the property for cash 

properties contributed to the operating partnership may have unrealized gains attributable to the difference between the fair market value and adjusted tax basis in the properties prior to contribution as a result our sale of these properties could cause adverse tax consequences to the limited partners who contributed them 

generally the operating partnership has no obligation to consider the tax consequences of its actions to any limited partner however the operating partnership may acquire properties in the future subject to material restrictions on refinancing or resale designed to minimize the adverse tax consequences to the limited partners who contribute those properties these restrictions could significantly reduce our flexibility to manage our assets by preventing us from reducing mortgage debt or selling a property when such a transaction might be in our best interest in order to reduce interest costs or dispose of an underperforming property 

risk factors related to our capital recycling and capital structure 

higher market capitalization rates for our properties could adversely impact our ability to recycle capital and fund developments and acquisitions and could dilute earnings 

as part of our capital recycling program we sell operating properties that no longer meet our investment standards we also develop certain retail centers because of their attractive margins with the intent of selling them to coinvestment partnerships or other third parties for a profit these sales proceeds are used to fund the construction of new developments an increase in market capitalization rates could cause a reduction in the value of centers identified for sale which would have an adverse impact on our capital recycling program by reducing the amount of cash generated and profits realized in order to meet the cash requirements of our development program we may be required to sell more properties than initially planned which would have a negative impact on our earnings 

our debt financing may reduce distributions to stock and unit holders 

we do not expect to generate sufficient funds from operations to make balloon principal payments on our debt when due if we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms we might be forced i to dispose of properties which might result in losses or ii to obtain financing at unfavorable terms either could reduce the cash flow available for distributions to stock and unit holders 

in addition if we cannot make required mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose on the property securing the mortgage causing the loss of cash flow from that property furthermore substantially all of our debt is crossdefaulted which means that a default under one loan could trigger defaults under other loans 

our organizational documents do not limit the amount of debt that may be incurred the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences including the following 

 

   

index to financial statements   

 covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition 

our unsecured notes unsecured line of credit and revolving credit facility contain customary covenants including compliance with financial ratios such as ratios of total debt to gross asset value and coverage ratios coverage ratio is defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” divided by the sum of the gross interest and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders our line of credit also restricts our ability to enter into a transaction that would result in a change of control these covenants may limit our operational flexibility and our acquisition activities moreover if we breach any of the covenants in our debt agreements including the covenants above and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately even in the absence of a payment default many of our debt arrangements including our unsecured notes unsecured line of credit and our revolving credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our stock 

we depend on external sources of capital which may not be available in the future 

to qualify as a reit the parent company must among other things distribute to its stockholders each year at least 90 of its reit taxable income excluding any net capital gains because of these distribution requirements we likely will not be able to fund all future capital needs including capital for acquisitions or developments with income from operations we therefore will have to rely on thirdparty sources of capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all our access to thirdparty sources of capital depends on a number of things including the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings in addition our line of credit imposes covenants that limit our flexibility in obtaining other financing such as a prohibition on negative pledge agreements 

additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders’ interests and additional debt financing may substantially increase our degree of leverage 

settlement provisions contained in forward sale agreements subject us to certain risks 

on december 9 2009 we entered into two forward sale agreements the “agreements” with jp morgan securities inc and wells fargo securities llc collectively the “forward purchasers” at the date of the agreements the forward purchasers borrowed 8 million shares from unrelated parties and sold those shares into the open market in march 2011 we expect to settle the agreements by issuing 8 million shares of regency centers corporation common stock to the forward purchasers unless we elect to settle in cash or we agree to extend the agreements with the forward purchasers settling the agreements by issuing shares to the forward purchasers will result in dilution to our earnings per share and unit and our return on equity 

if we elect to settle all or a portion of the 8 million shares of common stock included in the agreements in cash then we would expect the forward purchasers to repurchase our common stock in the open market to cover their obligation to return the shares of common stock that they borrowed in connection with the agreements if the market value of our common stock at the time of their repurchase is above the forward price we would pay the forward purchasers an amount in cash equal to the difference thus we would potentially be responsible for a substantial cash payment if our stock price were to rise substantially above the forward sale price on the date 

  

index to financial statements we elect to settle in cash in addition the repurchase of our common stock by the forward purchasers to unwind any hedge positions could cause the price of our common stock to increase thereby increasing the amount of cash we would owe to the forward purchasers upon a cash settlement of the agreements 

the agreements provide the forward purchasers the right to require us to settle in common shares by a specific date upon the occurrence of certain events irrespective of our interests including our need for capital in such a case we would be required to issue and deliver our common stock under the terms of the physical settlement provisions of the agreements which would result in dilution to our earnings per share and unit and our return on equity in addition upon certain events of bankruptcy insolvency or reorganization relating to us the agreements would terminate without further liability of either party and we would not issue any shares nor would we receive any proceeds pursuant to the agreements 

risk factors related to interest rates and the market for our stock 

we may be forced to deleverage our business with our operating cash flows which could result in the reduction of distributions to our stock and unit holders a reduction in investments into our business or additional equity offerings that dilute our stock and unit holders’ interests 

we depend on external financing principally debt financing to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt our access to financing depends on our credit rating the willingness of creditors to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets without access to external financing we would be required to pay outstanding debt with our operating cash flows and our operating cash flows may not be sufficient to pay our outstanding debt as it comes due if we are required to deleverage our business with operating cash flows we may be forced to reduce the amount of or eliminate altogether our distributions to stock and unit holders or refrain from making investments in our business 

we and our joint ventures have a significant amount of debt maturing in 2011 and 2012 during this time period we have 4020 million maturing and our joint ventures have 7415 million maturing our prorata share is 2846 million in addition to finding creditors willing to lend to us we are dependent upon our joint venture partners to contribute their share of any amount needed to repay or refinance existing debt when lenders reduce the amount of debt our joint ventures are refinancing 

increased market interest rates could reduce the parent company’s stock price 

the annual dividend rate on our common stock as a percentage of its market price may influence the trading price of our stock an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers to demand a higher annual dividend rate which could adversely affect the market price of our stock a decrease in the market price of our common stock could reduce our ability to raise additional equity in the public markets selling common stock at a decreased market price would have a dilutive impact on existing stockholders 

the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors many of which are out of our control including 

 

  

  

  

   

  

index to financial statements   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these factors may cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of our financial condition results of operations business or prospects it is impossible to ensure that the market price of our common stock will not fall in the future 

risk factors related to federal income tax laws 

if the parent company fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes it would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 

we believe that we qualify for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes and we plan to operate so that we can continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit if we qualify as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on our income that we distribute currently to our stockholders many of the reit requirements however are highly technical and complex the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances some of which may not be totally within our control and some of which involve questions of interpretation for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income must come from specific passive sources like rent that are itemized in the reit tax laws there can be no assurance that the internal revenue service “irs” or a court would agree with the positions we have taken in interpreting the reit requirements we are also required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains the fact that we hold many of our assets through coinvestment partnerships and their subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status furthermore congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult or impossible for us to remain qualified as a reit 

also unless the irs granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we would remain disqualified as a reit for four years following the year we first failed to qualify if we failed to qualify as a reit we would have to pay significant income taxes reducing cash available to pay dividends which would likely have a significant adverse affect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to pay any dividends to stockholders 

even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we are required to pay certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from “prohibited transactions” that income will be subject to a 100 tax in general prohibited transactions include sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business the determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale while we have undertaken a significant number of asset sales in recent years we do not believe that those sales should be considered prohibited transactions but there can be no assurance that the irs would not contend otherwise 

  

  

index to financial statements in addition any net taxable income earned directly by our taxable affiliates including regency realty group inc “rrg” our taxable reit subsidiary is subject to federal and state corporate income tax several provisions of the laws applicable to reit’s and their subsidiaries ensure that a taxable reit subsidiary will be subject to an appropriate level of federal income taxation for example a taxable reit subsidiary is limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to an affiliated reit in addition a reit has to pay a 100 penalty tax on some payments that it receives if the economic arrangements between the reit the reit’s tenants and the taxable reit subsidiary are not comparable to similar arrangements between unrelated parties finally some state and local jurisdictions may tax some of our income even though as a reit we are not subject to federal income tax on that income to the extent that we and our affiliates are required to pay federal state and local taxes we will have less cash available for dividends to our stockholders 

a reit may not own securities in any one issuer if the value of those securities exceeds 5 of the value of the reit’s total assets or the securities owned by the reit represent more than 10 of the issuer’s outstanding voting securities or 10 of the value of the issuer’s outstanding securities an exception to these tests allows a reit to own securities of a subsidiary that exceed the 5 value test and the 10 value tests if the subsidiary elects to be a “taxable reit subsidiary” we are not able to own securities of taxable reit subsidiaries that represent in the aggregate more than 25 of the value of our total assets we currently own more than 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of rrg 

risk factors related to our ownership limitations and the florida business corporation act 

restrictions on the ownership of the parent company’s capital stock to preserve our reit status could delay or prevent a change in control 

ownership of more than 7 by value of our outstanding capital stock by certain persons is restricted for the purpose of maintaining our qualification as a reit with certain exceptions this 7 limitation may discourage a change in control and may also i deter tender offers for our capital stock which offers may be attractive to our stockholders or ii limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their capital stock that might otherwise exist if an investor attempted to assemble a block in excess of 7 of our outstanding capital stock or to affect a change in control 

the issuance of the parent company’s capital stock could delay or prevent a change in control 

our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to 30000000 shares of preferred stock and 10000000 shares of special common stock and to establish the preferences and rights of any shares issued the issuance of preferred stock or special common stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control even if a change in control were in our stockholders’ interest the provisions of the florida business corporation act regarding control share acquisitions and affiliated transactions could also deter potential acquisitions by preventing the acquiring party from voting the common stock it acquires or consummating a merger or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of our disinterested stockholders

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview of our strategy 

regency centers corporation the “parent company” began its operations as a real estate investment trust “reit” in 1993 and is the managing general partner in regency centers lp the “operating partnership” the term “the company” or “regency” means the parent company and the operating partnership collectively our key strategic goals are focused on producing superior results to our shareholders by achieving total shareholder returns in excess of reit shopping center averages and sustaining growth in our net asset value and our earnings over an extended period of time we will achieve these goals through owning operating and investing in a highquality portfolio of primarily groceryanchored shopping centers that are tenanted by marketdominant grocers categoryleading anchors specialty retailers and restaurants located in areas with above average household incomes and population densities all of our operating investing and financing activities are performed through the operating partnership its whollyowned subsidiaries and through its investments in real estate partnerships with third parties also referred to as coinvestment partnerships or joint ventures the parent company currently owns approximately 998 of the outstanding common partnership units of the operating partnership because of our structure and certain public debt financing the operating partnership is also a registrant 

at december 31 2010 we directly owned 215 shopping centers the “consolidated properties” located in 23 states representing 233 million square feet of gross leasable area “gla” our cost of these shopping centers and those under development is 40 billion before depreciation through coinvestment partnerships we own partial ownership interests in 181 shopping centers the “unconsolidated properties” located in 25 states and the district of columbia representing 218 million square feet of gla our investment in the partnerships that own the unconsolidated properties is 4286 million certain portfolio information described below is presented 1 on a combined basis which is a total of the consolidated properties and the unconsolidated properties 2 for our consolidated properties only and 3 for the unconsolidated properties that we own through coinvestment partnerships we believe that presenting the information under these methods provides a more complete understanding of the properties that we whollyown versus those that we indirectly own through entities we do not control but for which we provide asset management property management leasing investing and financing services the shopping center portfolio that we manage on a combined basis represents 396 shopping centers located in 28 states and the district of columbia and contains 451 million square feet of gla 

we earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to grocery stores major retail anchors sideshop retailers and restaurants including ground leasing or selling building pads outparcels to these same types of tenants historically we have experienced growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates in our existing shopping centers and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers our shopping centers generate substantial daily traffic by conveniently offering necessities and services this high traffic should generate increased sales to our tenants and attract new tenants to our shopping centers thereby driving higher occupancy levels and rentalrate growth which we expect will provide sustained growth in earnings per share and unit and net asset value over the long term increasing occupancy in our shopping centers to historical levels and achieving positive rental rate growth are key objectives of our strategic plan 

we seek a range of strong national regional and local specialty retailers for the same reason that we choose to anchor our centers with leading grocers and major retailers who provide a mix of goods and services that meet consumer needs we have created a formal partnering process the premier customer initiative “pci” to promote mutually beneficial relationships with our sideshop retailers the objective of pci is for us to build a base of nonanchor tenants who represent the “bestinclass” operators in their respective merchandising categories such retailers reinforce the consumer appeal and other strengths of a center’s anchor help grow and stabilize a center’s occupancy reduce releasing downtime reduce tenant turnover and yield higher sustainable rents 

at december 31 2010 the operating shopping centers on a combined basis were 932 leased and unchanged from december 31 2009 during the recession of 2009 we did experience occupancy declines in our 

  

index to financial statements shopping centers however occupancy levels appear to have stabilized as the economy continues its recovery we continue to produce higher levels of new leasing activity and fewer tenant defaults as compared to 2009 and moveouts of weaker tenants hurt by the recession appear to be on the decline we did however continue to experience a decline in our rental rates during 2010 and 2009 rental rates in the combined portfolio declined 27 and 20 respectively we currently expect rental rates to decline moderately in isolated markets as we release vacant space or renew expiring leases where the previous tenant’s rental rates were above market 

we continue to closely monitor the operating performance and rent collections of all tenants in our shopping centers especially those tenants operating retail formats that are experiencing significant changes in competition business practice and store closings in other locations we expect these weaker tenants to continue moving out of our shopping centers during 2011 which will provide us the opportunity to release these vacancies to financially stronger vibrant tenants that will contribute to the overall success of our shopping centers 

we also continue to monitor tenants who have cotenancy clauses in their lease agreements these tenants are typically located in larger format community shopping centers that contain multiple anchor tenants whose leases contain these types of clauses cotenancy clauses have several variants they may allow a tenant to postpone a store opening if certain other tenants fail to open their store they may allow a tenant the opportunity to close their store prior to lease expiration if another tenant closes their store prior to lease expiration or more commonly they may allow a tenant to pay reduced levels of rent until a certain number of tenants open their stores within the same shopping center if economic weakness persists in geographic areas where we have centers that contain leases with these types of clauses we could experience reductions in rent and occupancy related to tenants exercising their cotenancy clauses 

we grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions of operating centers and new shopping center development we will continue to use our unique combination of development capabilities market presence and anchor relationships to invest in valueadded opportunities sourced from land owners and joint venture partners the redevelopment of existing centers and the development of land development is customer driven meaning we generally have an executed lease from the anchor before we start construction developments serve the growth needs of our anchors and specialty retailers resulting in modern shopping centers with longterm anchor leases that produce attractive returns on our invested capital this development process typically requires three to five years from initial land or redevelopment acquisition through construction leaseup and stabilization of rental income but can take longer depending upon tenant demand for new stores and the size of the project 

in the near term fewer new store openings by retailers are resulting in reduced demand for new retail space as a result we scaled back our development program by decreasing the number of new projects started phasing existing developments that lack retail demand and decreasing overhead costs although our development program will continue to play an important part in our long term business strategy new development projects will be rigorously evaluated in regard to the cost and availability of capital visibility of tenant demand to achieve a stabilized occupancy and sufficient investment returns 

we strive to cost effectively and opportunistically strengthen our balance sheet which should allow us to access various sources of capital to fund our future commitments we endeavor to continue improving our key financial ratios and to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets 815 of our consolidated real estate assets at december 31 2010 are unencumbered such assets allow us to access the secured and unsecured debt markets and to maintain significant availability on our 7138 million unsecured line of credit “the line” and revolving credit facility which had an outstanding balance of 100 million on the line at december 31 2010 our debt to asset ratio before the effect of accumulated depreciation including our prorata share of the debt and assets of joint ventures is 484 at december 31 2010 and is higher than our ratio at december 31 2009 of 459 however our ratio could decline in 2011 if we settle the 2460 million forward equity offering during 2011 discussed further below our coverage ratio including our prorata share of our partnerships was 21 times at december 31 2010 and 2009 we define our coverage ratio as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” divided by the sum of the gross interest and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our 

  

index to financial statements lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders we plan to grow ebitda through growth in net operating income by returning the occupancy percentages in our shopping centers back to historic levels and by acquiring or developing high quality shopping centers which in combination with a conservative capital structure should favorably impact our coverage ratio on a longterm basis 

capital recycling involves identifying nonstrategic assets from our real estate portfolio and selling those in the open market and reinvesting the sale proceeds into new higher quality developments and acquisitions that will generate sustainable revenue growth and attractive returns to the extent that we are unable to generate capital in excess of our current commitments we intend to reduce our new investment activity accordingly 

coinvestment partnerships provide us with a reliable capital source for shopping center acquisitions as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset management property management and other investing and financing services as asset manager we are engaged by our partners to apply similar operating investment and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the coinvestment partnerships as those applied to the portfolio that we whollyown coinvestment partnerships grow their shopping center investments through acquisitions from third parties or direct purchases from us although selling properties to coinvestment partnerships reduces our direct ownership interest it provides a source of capital that further strengthens our balance sheet while we continue to share to the extent of our ownership interest in the risks and rewards of shopping centers that meet our high quality standards and longterm investment strategy 

our coinvestment partnerships have significant levels of debt that mature through 2012 and are subject to significant borrowing risks if the capital markets again become unavailable as they were during the recession while we have to date successfully refinanced our maturing loans the us economy although recovering remains weak and could hinder our ability to access capital including access by our joint venture partners or to obtain future financing to fund maturing debt currently we believe that our joint venture partners have sufficient capital or access thereto for these future capital requirements the impact to the company or a coinvestment partner defaulting on its share of a capital call is discussed below under “liquidity and capital resources”

  although base rent is supported by longterm lease contracts tenants who file bankruptcy are given the right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues and tenant receivables we are closely monitoring industry trends and sales data to help us identify declines in retail categories or tenants who might be experiencing financial difficulties as a result of slowing sales lack of credit changes in retail formats or increased competition as a result of our findings we may reduce new leasing suspend leasing or curtail the allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements within a certain retail category or to a specific retailer

we currently estimate that we will require 4558 million through 2013 primarily to repay 3980 million of maturing debt excluding scheduled principal payments complete inprocess developments and to fund our prorata share of estimated capital contributions to our coinvestment partnerships for repayment of debt included in these capital requirements are 3741 million of unsecured public debt as further described below under notes payable which we intend to repay at maturity from the proceeds of new unsecured issues of debt or equity to the extent that issuing unsecured debt is cost prohibitive or unavailable we believe that we have sufficient unsecured assets available for secured mortgage financing whose proceeds could be used to repay the unsecured debt at maturity when necessary the line is available to fund our capital needs we will also receive estimated net proceeds of 2178 million once we settle the 80 million common share forward equity offering “forward equity offering” as further discussed below under equity and capital 

as part of our strategy we will sell shopping centers that no longer meet our longterm investment criteria and invest those proceeds into higher quality shopping centers during 2010 we sold three shopping centers for 363 million and reinvested the majority of the proceeds into two shopping centers with a combined purchase price of 820 million including the assumption of existing mortgage debt of 590 million

our preferred stock and preferred units though callable by us are not redeemable in cash at the option of the holders 

although common or preferred equity raised in the public markets by the parent company is an option to fund future capital needs access to these markets could be limited at times when conditions for the issuance of securities are acceptable we will evaluate issuing debt or equity to fund new acquisition opportunities fund new developments or repay maturing debt at december 31 2010 the parent company and the operating partnership each had existing shelf registration statements available for the issuance of new equity or debt securities 

investments in real estate partnerships 

we account for certain investments in real estate partnerships using the equity method we have determined that these investments are not variable interest entities and do not require consolidation under financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” topic 810 and therefore are subject to the voting interest model in determining our basis of accounting major decisions including leasing property acquisitions not meeting preestablished investment criteria dispositions financings annual budgets and dissolution of the joint ventures are subject to the approval of all partners 

recognition of gains from sales to coinvestment partnerships is recorded on only that portion of the sales not attributable to our ownership interest unless there are certain provisions in the partnership agreement which allow the company a unilateral right to initiate a dik upon liquidation as described further below under our critical accounting policies and note 1b summary of significant accounting policies in our consolidated financial statements each included herein the presence of such dik provisions requires that we apply a more restrictive method of gain recognition “restricted gain method” on sales of properties to these coinvestment partnerships this method considers our potential ability to receive property through a dik on which partial gain has been recognized and ensures maximum gain deferral upon sale to a coinvestment partnership containing these unilateral dik rights “dikjv” during 2010 and 2009 we did not sell any properties to a dikjv 

the operations and gains related to properties sold to our investments in real estate partnerships are not classified as discontinued operations because we continue to provide property management services to these shopping centers under market rate agreements with our coinvestment partnerships for those properties acquired by joint ventures from unrelated parties we are required to contribute our prorata share of the purchase price based on our ownership interest in the coinvestment partnerships

critical accounting policies and estimates 

knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial statements the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities at a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period these accounting estimates are based upon but not limited to our judgments about historical results current economic activity and industry accounting standards they are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness however the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates 

revenue recognition and accounts receivable – accounts receivable represent revenues recognized in our financial statements and include base rent percentage rent and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs insurance and real estate taxes we analyze tenant receivables historical bad debt levels customer creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts our reported net income loss is directly affected by our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable 

recognition of gains from the sales of real estate – profits from sales of real estate are recognized under the full accrual method by us when a sale is consummated the buyer’s initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property a receivable if applicable is not subject to future subordination we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership and we do not have substantial continuing involvement with the property we sell shopping center properties to joint ventures in exchange for cash equal to the fair value of the percentage interest acquired by our partners we have accounted for those sales as “partial sales” and recognized gains on those partial sales in the period the properties were sold to the extent of the percentage interest sold and in the case of certain joint venture partnerships we apply a more restrictive method of recognizing gains as discussed below the gains and operations associated with properties sold to these joint venture partnerships are not classified as discontinued operations because we continue to partially own and manage these shopping centers certain dikjvs give either partner the unilateral right to elect to dissolve the joint venture partnership and upon such an election receive a distribution inkind of the assets of the joint venture partnership equal to its respective ownership interests we have concluded that these dik dissolution provisions constitute insubstance callput options and represent a form of continuing involvement with respect to property that we sold to these joint venture partnerships limiting our recognition of gain related to the partial sale this more restrictive method of gain recognition the restricted gain method considers our potential ability to receive property through a dik on which partial gain has been recognized and ensures maximum gain deferral upon sale to a dikjv we have applied the restricted gain method to partial sales of property to joint venture partnerships that contain such unilateral dik provisions 

capitalization of costs – we capitalize the acquisition of land the construction of buildings and other specifically identifiable development costs incurred by recording them into properties in development in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets in summary a project changes from nonoperating to operating when it is substantially completed and held available for occupancy at that time costs are no longer capitalized other development costs include predevelopment costs essential to the development of the property as well as interest real estate taxes and direct employee costs incurred during the development period predevelopment 

  

index to financial statements costs are incurred prior to land acquisition during the due diligence phase and include contract deposits legal engineering and other professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center at december 31 2010 and 2009 we had capitalized predevelopment costs of approximately 899000 and 816000 respectively of which approximately 840000 and 325000 respectively were refundable contract deposits if we determine that the development of a specific project undergoing due diligence is no longer probable we immediately expense all related capitalized predevelopment costs not considered recoverable during the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 we expensed predevelopment costs of approximately 520000 38 million and 155 million respectively recorded in other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations interest costs are capitalized into each development project based on applying our weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the actual development costs expended we cease interest cost capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements but in no event would we capitalize interest on the project beyond 12 months after substantial completion of the building shell during the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 we capitalized interest of 51 million 191 million and 365 million respectively on our development projects we have a staff of employees who directly support our development program all direct internal costs attributable to these development activities are capitalized as part of each development project during the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 we capitalized 27 million 65 million and 278 million respectively of direct costs incurred to support our development program the capitalization of costs is directly related to the actual level of development activity occurring if accounting standards issued in the future were to limit the amount of internal costs that may be capitalized we could incur additional increases in general and administrative expenses which would further reduce net income 

real estate acquisitions – upon acquisition of operating real estate properties we estimate the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land building and improvements and identify intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and belowmarket leases inplace leases and tenant relationships and assumed debt based on these estimates we assign the purchase price to the applicable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities we evaluate the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets each reporting period and account for any changes in estimated useful lives over the revised remaining useful life we expense transaction costs associated with business combinations in the period incurred 

valuation of real estate investments – our longlived assets primarily real estate held for investment are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted in addition we perform an annual review to reevaluate marketbased capitalization rates estimated holding periods expected future operating income trends and prospects the effects of demand competition and other factors if we determine that the carrying amount of a property is not recoverable we write down the asset to fair value for properties to be “held and used” for long term investment to determine recoverability we estimate undiscounted future cash flows over the expected investment term including the estimated future value of the asset upon sale at the end of the investment period future value is generally determined by applying a marketbased capitalization rate to the estimated future net operating income in the final year of the expected investment term if the estimated undiscounted cash flows used in the recoverability test are less than the longlived asset’s carrying amount management then determines the fair value of the longlived asset and if the carrying amount of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value fair value is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the traditional discounted cash flow approach for properties “held for sale” we estimate current market resale values through appraisal less expected costs to sell a loss in value of an investment under the equity method of accounting which is other than a temporary decline must be recognized in the period in which the loss occurs in the case of our investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships we calculate the present value of our investment by discounting estimated future cash flows over the expected term of the investment fair value can 

  

index to financial statements fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including changes in the general economy of those markets in which we operate our estimated holding period of the property tenant credit quality and demand for new retail stores if as a result of a change in our strategy for a specific property which we own directly or through our coinvestment partnerships a property previously classified as held and used is changed to held for sale or if its estimated holding period changes such change could cause us to determine that the property is impaired and a provision for impairment in relation to that property would be recorded by us either directly or through a reduction of our equity in income of real estate partnerships 

discontinued operations – the application of current accounting principles that govern the classification of any of our properties as heldforsale on the balance sheet or the presentation of results of operations and gains on the sale of these properties as discontinued requires management to make certain significant judgments we classify an operating property or a property in development as heldforsale when we determine that the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition the property is being actively marketed for sale and management believes it is probable that a sale will be consummated within one year given the nature of real estate sales contracts it is not unusual for such contracts to allow a contractual buyer a due diligence period to evaluate the property with the right to cancel the contract without any financial loss in addition certain other matters critical to the final sale such as financing arrangements often remain pending even upon contract acceptance as a result properties under contract may not close within the expected time period or may not close at all therefore any properties categorized as heldforsale represent only those properties that management has determined are likely to close within the requirements set forth above in order to determine if the results of operations and gain on sale should be reflected as discontinued operations prior to the sale we evaluate the extent of our involvement and significance of cash flows the sale will have on a property after the sale any property sold in which we have significant continuing involvement or cash flows most often sales to coinvestment partnerships in which we continue to manage the property is not considered to be discontinued in addition any property which we sell to an unrelated third party but which we retain a property management function is not considered discontinued therefore only properties sold or to be sold to unrelated third parties where we will have no significant continuing involvement or significant cash flows are classified as discontinued and their operations including any mortgage interest and gain on sale are reported in discontinued operations so that the operations are clearly distinguished prior periods are also reclassified to reflect the operations of these properties as discontinued operations when we sell operating properties to our joint ventures or to third parties and will have continuing involvement the operations and gains on sales are included in income from continuing operations if circumstances arise that previously were considered unlikely and as a result we decide not to sell a property previously classified as held for sale the property is reclassified as held and used and is measured individually at the lower of its i carrying amount before the property was classified as held for sale adjusted for any depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held and used or ii the fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell any required adjustment to the carrying amount of the property reclassified as held and used is included in income from continuing operations in the period of the subsequent decision not to sell if a property is reclassified as held and used the results of operations of the property previously reported in discontinued operations are reclassified and included in income from continuing operations for all periods presented 

investments in real estate partnerships – in addition to owning real estate directly we invest in real estate through our coinvestment partnerships as asset and property manager we conduct the business of the unconsolidated properties held in the coinvestment partnerships in the same way that we conduct the business of the consolidated properties that are whollyowned therefore the critical accounting policies as described are also applicable to our investments in the real estate partnerships we account for all investments in which we do not have a controlling financial ownership interest using the equity method we have determined that these investments are not variable interest entities and do not require consolidation and therefore are subject to the voting interest model in determining our basis of accounting decisions including property acquisitions and dispositions financings certain leasing arrangements annual budgets and dissolution of the joint ventures are subject to the approval of all partners or in the case of the fund its advisory committee 

  

index to financial statements income tax status – the parent company believes it qualifies and intends to continue to qualify as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code the “code” the parent company is required to meet certain income and asset tests on a periodic basis to ensure that it continues to qualify as a reit as a reit the parent company is allowed to reduce taxable income by all or a portion of its distributions to shareholders we evaluate the transactions that we enter into and determine their impact on our reit status projects we have a staff of employees who directly support our development program all direct internal costs attributable to these development activities are capitalized as part of each development project during the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 we capitalized 27 million 65 million and 278 million respectively of direct costs incurred to support our development program the capitalization of costs is directly related to the actual level of development activity occurring if accounting standards issued in the future were to limit the amount of internal costs that may be capitalized we could incur additional increases in general and administrative expenses which would further reduce net income 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in january 2010 the fasb issued accounting standards update “asu” no 201006 “fair value measurements and disclosures 820 – improving disclosures about fair value measurements” “asu 201006” asu 201006 provides amendments to subtopic 82010 and requires new disclosures for transfers in and out of levels 1 and 2 and activity in level 3 fair value measurements asu 201006 also clarifies existing disclosure requirements for the level of disaggregation for each class of assets and liabilities and for the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value asu 201006 is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after december 15 2009 except for the disclosures about purchases sales issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level 3 fair value measurements which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2010 and for interim periods within those fiscal years we adopted this asu on december 31 2009 

in december 2009 the fasb issued asu no 200917 “improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities” “asu 200917” asu 200917 was issued to reflect the amendments from statement 167 “amendments to fasb interpretation no 46r” as a revision to fasb interpretation no 46 revised december 2003 “consolidation of variable interest entities” asu 200917 changes how a reporting entity determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated the determination of whether a reporting entity is required to consolidate another entity is based on among other things the other entity’s purpose and design and the reporting entity’s ability to direct the activities of the other entity that most significantly impact the other entity’s economic performance asu 200917 was effective january 1 2010 and early application is not permitted we have evaluated the adoption of this asu and it has no effect on our results of operations or financial position as we do not currently have any variable interests that we believe would require consolidation 

results from operations – 2010 vs 2009 

comparison of the years ended december 31 2010 to 2009 

at december 31 2010 on a combined basis we were operating or developing 396 shopping centers as compared to 400 shopping centers at december 31 2009 we identify our shopping centers as either properties in development or operating properties properties in development are defined as properties that are in the construction or leaseup process and have not reached their initial full occupancy a development property becomes an operating property at the earlier to occur of attaining 95 leased and rent paying or four years from the start of site work regardless of the percentage leased at december 31 2010 on a combined basis we had 26 development properties as compared to 40 properties at december 31 2009 

  

index to financial statements our revenues decreased by 13 million or 03 to 4868 million in 2010 as summarized in the following table in thousands 

 

 generally leased percentages were unchanged between 2010 and 2009 however the percent leased of a development property may not reflect rent paying occupancy if a tenant’s space is under construction for a portion of the year and not yet rent paying therefore increase in minimum rent was related primarily to tenants opening new stores in our development properties during 2010 or operating for a full 12 months during 2010 as compared to 2009 declines in percentage rent were a result of the change in percentage rent lease terms due to the increase in minimum rent for certain leases upon their renewal the increase in recoveries from tenants and other income resulted from a significant increase in termination fees received during 2010 related to weak tenant operators negotiating an early end to their lease agreements as well as higher operating and real estate tax expenses the decrease in management transaction and other fees relates primarily to a 78 million disposition fee we received from chrr in 2009 equal to 1 of the gross sales price paid by gri described below 

we earn fees at marketbased rates for asset management disposition property management leasing acquisition and financing services that we provide to our coinvestment partnerships and third parties as follows in thousands 

 

 asset management fees which are tied to the value of the real estate we manage for our coinvestment partners decreased in 2010 due to an overall decline in commercial real estate values but was also a result of the liquidation of a joint venture with macquarie countrywide that occurred in 2009 as well as our increased ownership and revised agreements in the grir joint venture which resulted in lower fees paid to us by our partner property management fees are based on net operating income and increased as a result of the increase in base rent transaction fees decreased primarily as a result of the 78 million disposition fee we received from chrr in 2009 leasing commissions decreased as a result of our increased ownership in the grir joint venture which resulted in a reduction of fee recognized 

our operating expenses increased by 45 million or 15 to 3116 million in 2010 the following table summarizes our operating expenses in thousands 

 

   

index to financial statements increases in operating maintenance and real estate taxes along with depreciation and amortization expense are primarily related to the recently completed developments commencing operations in the current year and general increases in expenses incurred by the operating properties the majority of these cost increases are recoverable from our tenants and included in our revenues general and administrative expense increased 22 million as a result of higher levels of compensation earned in 2010 for higher levels of performance as compared to 2009 the provision for doubtful accounts decreased 47 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 directly related to significantly improved tenant collection rates and fewer tenant defaults continued evidence of the recovering us economy the decrease in other expenses is due to a 13 million tax benefit incurred in 2010 as compared to tax expense of 18 million incurred in 2009 as well as a reduction in predevelopment costs written off as a result of pursuing less new development activity during 2010 

the following table presents the change in interest expense in thousands 

 

 interest on unsecured credit facilities decreased by 46 million as a result of lower outstanding balances during 2010 as compared to 2009 capitalized interest decreased as a result of a reduced development activity as compared to 2009 and a higher level of shopping center completions during 2010 

during 2010 we sold eleven outparcels for net proceeds of 118 million and recognized a gain of approximately 661000 as compared to 2009 where we sold 18 outparcels for net proceeds of 278 million and recognized a gain of approximately 219000 during 2010 we recognized approximately 332000 in contingent gains related to three properties sold to the usaa partnership during 2009 during 2009 we sold eight operating properties to the usaa partnership for net proceeds of 1033 million and recognized gains of 191 million recorded under the restricted gain method 

in 2010 we recorded a provision for impairment of 266 million which was a decrease of 709 million from the impairment provision recorded in 2009 the impairment provision recorded in 2010 was a result of identifying properties that had been previously considered held for long term investment and determining that they no longer met our long term investment strategy as a result of this reevaluation we changed our expected investment holding period and reduced our carrying value to estimated fair value during 2009 we recorded a provision for impairment of 1044 million of which 937 million related to land held for future development or sale during 2009 a prospective anchor tenant for several development sites expressed considerable uncertainty about the timing and location of future stores given the recession occurring during that period as a result we reevaluated and reduced the probability of future development at these sites and accordingly reduced our carrying value in the land parcels to estimated fair value of the land included in the impairment provision recorded during 2009 were operating properties that were subjected to the same investment criteria evaluation that we applied during 2010 and we accordingly reduced our carrying value on those properties to estimated fair value based upon a change in expected holding periods if we sell a property or classify a property as heldforsale we are required to reclassify its operations into discontinued operations for all prior periods which results in a reclassification of amounts previously reported as continuing operations into discontinued operations all of the 266 million provision was recorded in continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2010 and of the 1044 million provision recorded during the year ended december 31 2009 69 million was reclassified into discontinued operations 

  

index to financial statements our equity in loss of investments in real estate partnerships was 135 million less during 2010 as compared to 2009 as follows in thousands 

 

  

  the change in our equity in loss of investments in real estate partnerships is primarily related to increasing our ownership interest in grir effective january 1 2010 to 40 from our 2495 ownership interest in 2009 combined with similar positive trends that we experienced in the consolidated properties as they relate to increases in base rent reductions in provisions for doubtful accounts higher termination fees and lower provisions for impairment during 2010 our prorata share of the impairment reserves recorded in the real estate partnerships was 230 million as compared to 261 million in 2009 during 2009 impairment provisions were primarily incurred and recorded by grir however during 2010 impairment provisions which were significantly lower in grir and contributed to grir’s reduction in equity loss were higher in columbia i and the fund which contributed to the equity losses reported by these two partnerships in 2010 

income from discontinued operations was 76 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 62 million for the year ended december 31 2009 income from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2010 includes the sale of two operating properties and one property in development for combined net proceeds of 349 million and gains of 76 million net of taxes and the operations of shopping centers sold or classified as heldfor sale in 2010 and 2009 income from discontinued operations for the year ended december 1 2009 includes the sale of one operating property and four properties in development for combined net proceeds of 493 million and gains of 58 million and the operations of shopping centers sold or classified as held for sale in 2010 and 2009 if we sell a property or classify a property as heldforsale we are required to reclassify its operations into discontinued operations for all prior periods which results in a reclassification of amounts previously reported as continuing operations into discontinued operations 

related to our parent company’s results our net loss attributable to common stockholders for the year ended december 31 2010 was 77 million an increase in net income of 487 million as compared with the net loss of 564 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the higher net income was primarily related to a lower provision for impairment recorded during 2010 as compared to 2009 moderate improvement in our operating fundamentals impacting base rent but partially offset by lower gains realized in 2010 on sales of operating properties and higher interest expense our diluted net loss per share was 010 in 2010 as compared to diluted net loss per share of 074 in 2009 

  

index to financial statements related to our operating partnership results our net loss attributable to common unit holders for the year ended december 31 2010 was 76 million an increase in net income of 490 million as compared with the net loss of 566 million for the year ended december 31 2009 for the same reasons stated above our diluted net loss per unit was 010 for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to net loss per unit of 074 for the year ended december 31 2009 

results from operations – 2009 vs 2008 

comparison of the years ended december 31 2009 to 2008 

at december 31 2009 on a combined basis we were operating or developing 400 shopping centers as compared to 440 shopping centers at december 31 2008 the decrease in properties is related to the liquidation of the assets of mcwr i where the properties were distributed through a dik to mcw and regency and in which we received six properties at december 31 2009 on a combined basis we had 40 development properties as compared to 45 properties at december 31 2008 

our revenues decreased by 69 million to 4881 million in 2009 as summarized in the following table in thousands 

 

 our decline in revenues was related to a onetime transaction fee earned and recognized in 2008 which is more fully described in the fee table and discussion below the increase in minimum rent related primarily to new properties distributed to us as part of the mcwr i dik liquidation and new rent generated by the development properties 

we earn fees at marketbased rates for asset management disposition property management leasing acquisition and financing services that we provide to our coinvestment partnerships and third parties as follows in thousands 

 

 asset management fees which are tied to the value of the real estate we manage for our coinvestment partners decreased in 2009 due to an overall decline in commercial real estate values as well as a reduction in the number of joint venture partnership properties we manage as a result of the dik liquidation of mcwr i transaction fees decreased as a result of the 197 million portfolio incentive return fee earned and recognized in 2008 and not recurring in 2009 

  

index to financial statements our operating expenses increased by 300 million or 108 to 3071 million in 2009 the following table summarizes our operating expenses in thousands 

 

 increases in operating maintenance and real estate taxes along with depreciation and amortization expense were primarily related to six properties distributed to us as part of the mcwr i dik liquidation during 2009 not included in the 2008 amounts completed developments that commenced operations in 2009 and general increases in expenses incurred by the operating properties general and administrative expense was 94 higher in 2009 primarily related to 75 million in severance and benefit payments associated with two reductions in force completed during 2009 offset by reduction in incentive compensation for not achieving targeted performance levels during 2009 we increased the provision for doubtful accounts to reserve for past due amounts reflecting a significantly higher tenant default rate on rental payments as tenants struggled during the recession of 2009 the decrease in other expenses was due to a reduction in predevelopment costs written off as a result of pursuing less new development activity 

the following table presents the change in interest expense in thousands 

 

 interest on unsecured credit facilities decreased by 67 million as a result of lower average outstanding balances on our credit facilities in 2009 as compared to 2008 at december 31 2009 the balance of our line was zero we had repaid the term loan portion of our unsecured term facility and we completed a partial tender offer of outstanding unsecured debt interest on notes payable increased as a result of issuing 1060 million secured mortgage loans in addition to four mortgage loans assumed as part of the mcwr i dik liquidation capitalized interest decreased as inprocess developments were completed during 2009 and new development activity declined 

during 2009 we sold 18 outparcels for net proceeds of 278 million and recognized a gain of approximately 219000 whereas during 2008 we sold 12 outparcels for net proceeds of 382 million and recognized a gain of 53 million during 2008 we also recognized a 12 million gain on two outparcels originally deferred at the time of sale during 2009 we also sold eight operating properties to the usaa partnership for net proceeds of 1033 million and recognized gains of 191 million recorded under the restricted gain method during 2008 we sold four properties to several joint ventures for net proceeds of 1105 million and recognized gains of 138 million recorded under the restricted gain method 

during the year ended december 31 2009 we recorded a provision for impairment of 1044 million of which 937 million related to land held for future development or sale during 2009 a prospective anchor tenant for several development sites expressed considerable uncertainty about the timing and location of future stores given the continuation of the weak economy and reductions in consumer spending as a result we reevaluated and reduced the probability of future development at these sites and accordingly reduced our carrying value in 

  

index to financial statements the land parcels to estimated fair value included in the impairment loss was a 102 million provision related to operating properties that became targeted for sale in the near future which caused us to reevaluate and reduce our expected holding periods for these assets and corresponding future cash flows we also recorded a reserve of 465000 on a note receivable in default during the year ended december 31 2008 we recorded a provision for impairment of 349 million of which 72 million related to land held for future development or sale 206 million related to operating properties 11 million related to a note receivable in default and 60 related to our investment in real estate partnerships if we sell a property or classify a property as heldforsale we are required to reclassify its operations into discontinued operations for all prior periods which results in a reclassification of amounts previously reported as continuing operations into discontinued operations of the 1044 million provision recorded during the year ended december 31 2009 69 million was reclassified into discontinued operations and of the 349 million provision recorded during the year ended december 31 2008 34 million was reclassified into discontinued operations 

our equity in income loss of investments in real estate partnerships decreased by 317 million during 2009 as follows in thousands 

 

  

  

 the decrease in our equity in income loss of investments in real estate partnerships is primarily related to a provision for impairment of 1044 million recognized by grir associated with multiple shopping centers that became targeted for sale in the near future our prorata share of this provision for impairment was 261 million excluding the impairment the declines in revenues or losses incurred by our coinvestment partnerships were directly related to reductions in operating revenues as occupancy levels declined in 2009 and to increased allowances for doubtful accounts as they also experienced a significantly higher tenant default rate during a difficult economic environment 

income from discontinued operations was 62 million for the year ended december 31 2009 related to the operations of shopping centers sold or classified as heldforsale in 2010 2009 and 2008 whereas income from discontinued operations was 223 million for the year ended december 31 2008 income from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2009 includes the sale of four properties in development for net proceeds of 298 million and gains of 56 million one operating property which was sold for net proceeds of 

  

index to financial statements 195 million and a gain of approximately 273000 and the operations of shopping centers sold or classified as heldforsale in 2010 2009 and 2008 income from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2008 includes the sale of seven properties in development for net proceeds of 553 million and gains of 140 million three operating properties which were sold for net proceeds of 309 million and gains of 35 million and the operations of shopping centers sold or classified as heldforsale in 2010 2009 and 2008 if we sell a property or classify a property as heldforsale we are required to reclassify its operations into discontinued operations for all prior periods which results in a reclassification of amounts previously reported as continuing operations into discontinued operations 

related to our parent company’s results our net loss attributable to common stockholders for the year ended december 31 2009 was 564 million a decrease of 1729 million as compared with net income of 1165 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the decrease in net income was primarily related to the large provision for impairment recognized during 2009 our diluted net loss per share was 074 in 2009 as compared to diluted net income per share of 166 in 2008 

related to our operating partnership results our net loss attributable to common unit holders for the year ended december 31 2009 was 566 million a decrease of 1740 million as compared with net income of 1174 million for the year ended december 31 2008 for the same reasons stated above our diluted net loss per unit was 074 in 2009 as compared to net income per unit of 166 in 2008 

environmental matters 

we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers and underground petroleum storage tanks we believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations generally we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to nonchlorinated solvent systems where available we have applied and been accepted into statesponsored environmental programs we have a blanket environmental insurance policy that covers us against thirdparty liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination we have also placed environmental insurance where possible on specific properties with known contamination in order to mitigate our environmental risk we monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites we also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so we estimate the cost associated with these legal obligations to be 29 million and 32 million all of which has been accrued as of december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations however we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities that any previous owner occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants by the condition of nearby properties or by unrelated third parties or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us 

inflationdeflation 

inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers however more recent data suggests inflation will eventually become a greater concern as the economy continues to recover from the recent recession substantially all of our longterm leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation such provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rent based on tenants’ gross sales which generally increase as prices rise andor escalation clauses which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices in addition many of our leases are 

  

index to financial statements for terms of less than ten years which permits us to seek increased rents upon rerental at market rates most of our leases require tenants to pay their prorata share of operating expenses including commonarea maintenance real estate taxes insurance and utilities thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation however during deflationary periods or periods of economic weakness minimum rents and percentage rents will decline as the supply of available retail space exceeds demand and consumer spending declines occupancy declines resulting from a weak economic period will also likely result in lower recovery rates of our operating expenses

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk 

we are exposed to two significant components of interest rate risk our line commitment has a variable interest rate that is based upon libor plus a spread of 55 basis points and our revolving credit facility has a variable interest rate based upon libor plus a spread of 100 basis points libor rates charged on our unsecured credit facilities change monthly the spread on the unsecured credit facilities is dependent upon maintaining specific credit ratings if our credit ratings are downgraded the spread on the unsecured credit facilities would increase resulting in higher interest costs we are also exposed to higher interest rates when we refinance our existing longterm fixed rate debt the objective of our interest rate risk management is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we borrow primarily at fixed interest rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps caps or treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 

during 2006 we entered into four forwardstarting interest rate swaps the “swaps” totaling 3967 million with fixed rates of 5399 5415 5399 and 5415 at inception we designated these swaps as cash flow hedges to lock in the underlying treasury rates on 4000 million of fixed rate financing that was expected to occur in 2010 and 2011 during 2009 we paid 200 million to partially settle 1060 million of the 3967 swaps in place to hedge the 1060 million mortgage loan issued on july 1 2009 on june 1 2010 we paid 268 million to partially settle 1500 million of the remaining 2907 million swaps in place to hedge the 1500 million tenyear senior unsecured notes issued on june 2 2010 on september 30 2010 we paid 367 million to settle the remaining 1407 million of swaps to hedge the 2500 million tenyear senior unsecured notes issued on october 7 2010 for the year ended december 31 2010 we recognized income of 14 million for changes in hedge ineffectiveness attributable to revised inputs used in valuation models to estimate effectiveness 

we have 3747 million of fixed rate debt maturing in 2011 and 2012 that has a weighted average fixed interest rate of 729 which includes 3741 million of unsecured longterm debt we continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt to repay maturing debt or fund our commitments based upon the current capital markets our current credit ratings and the number of high quality unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings we expect that we will be able to successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund these debt obligations 

our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the table below presents the principal cash flows in thousands weighted average interest rates of remaining debt and the fair value of total debt in thousands as of december 31 2010 by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes although the average interest rate for variable rate debt is included in the table those rates represent rates that existed at december 31 2010 and are subject to change on a monthly basis 

  

index to financial statements the table below incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2010 and does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date since firm commitments are not presented the table has limited predictive value as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at that time and actual interest rates 

 

  

 the fair value of total debt in the table above is 17 billion versus the face value of 21 billion which suggests that as new debt is issued in the future to repay maturing debt the cost of new debt issuances will be higher than the current cost of existing debt

 item 1 business tableend regency centers corporation began its operations as a real estate investment trust “reit” in 1993 and is the managing general partner in regency centers lp  the term “the company” or “regency” means the parent company and the operating partnership collectively our key strategic goals are focused on total share and unit holder return in excess of peer indices and sustaining growth in net asset value and earnings we will achieve these goals through owning operating and investing in a highquality portfolio of primarily groceryanchored shopping centers that are tenanted by marketdominant grocers categoryleading anchors specialty retailers and restaurants located in areas with above average household incomes and population densities all of our operating investing and financing activities are performed through the operating partnership its whollyowned subsidiaries and through its investments in real estate partnerships with third parties also referred to as coinvestment partnerships or joint ventures the parent company currently owns 99 of the outstanding common partnership units of the operating partnership because of our structure and certain public debt financing the operating partnership is also a registrant 

at december 31 2009 we directly owned 216 shopping centers located in 23 states representing 230 million square feet of gross leasable area “gla” through coinvestment partnerships we own partial ownership interests in 184 shopping centers located in 25 states and the district of columbia representing 220 million square feet of gla the shopping center portfolio that we manage on a combined basis represents 400 shopping centers located in 28 states and the district of columbia and contains 450 million square feet of gla 

we earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to grocery stores major retail anchors sideshop retailers and restaurants including ground leasing or selling building pads outparcels to these same types of tenants historically we have experienced growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates in our existing shopping centers and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers our shopping centers generate substantial daily traffic by conveniently offering necessities and services this high traffic generates increased sales thereby driving higher occupancy and rentalrate growth which we expect will provide sustained growth in earnings per share and unit and net asset value over the long term 

we seek a range of strong national regional and local specialty retailers for the same reason that we choose to anchor our centers with leading grocers and major retailers who provide a mix of goods and services that meet consumer needs we have created a formal partnering process the premier customer initiative “pci” to promote mutually beneficial relationships with our sideshop retailers the objective of pci is for us to build a base of nonanchor tenants who represent the “bestinclass” operators in their respective merchandising categories such retailers reinforce the consumer appeal and other strengths of a center’s anchor help grow and stabilize a center’s occupancy reduce releasing downtime reduce tenant turnover and yield higher sustainable rents 

we grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions of operating centers and shopping center development we will continue to use our unique combination of development capabilities market presence and 

  

anchor relationships to invest in valueadded opportunities sourced from distressed owners the redevelopment of existing centers developing land that we already own and other opportunities development is customer driven meaning we generally have an executed lease from the anchor before we start construction developments serve the growth needs of our anchors and specialty retailers resulting in modern shopping centers with longterm anchor leases that produce attractive returns on our invested capital this development process typically requires three to five years from initial land or redevelopment acquisition through construction leaseup and stabilization of rental income but can take longer depending upon tenant demand for new stores and the size of the project 

we also invest in real estate partnerships these coinvestment partnerships provide us with a reliable capital source for shopping center acquisitions as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset management property management and other investing and financing services as asset manager we are engaged by our partners to apply similar operating investment and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the coinvestment partnerships as those applied to the portfolio that we whollyown coinvestment partnerships also grow their shopping center investments through acquisitions from third parties or direct purchases from us 

competition 

we are among the largest owners of shopping centers in the nation based on revenues number of properties gross leasable area and market capitalization there are numerous companies and private individuals engaged in the ownership development acquisition and operation of shopping centers which compete with us in our targeted markets this results in competition for attracting anchor tenants as well as the acquisition of existing shopping centers and new development sites we believe that the principal competitive factors in attracting tenants in our market areas are location demographics rental costs tenant mix property age and property maintenance we believe that our competitive advantages include our locations within our market areas the design quality of our shopping centers the strong demographics surrounding our shopping centers our relationships with our anchor tenants and our sideshop and outparcel retailers our pci program that allows us to provide retailers with multiple locations our practice of maintaining and renovating our shopping centers and our ability to source and develop new shopping centers 

changes in policies 

our board of directors establishes the policies that govern our investment and operating strategies including among others development and acquisition of shopping centers tenant and market focus debt and equity financing policies quarterly distributions to stock and unit holders and reit tax status the board of directors may amend these policies at any time without a vote of our stockholders 

employees 

our headquarters are located at one independent drive suite 114 jacksonville florida we presently maintain 18 market offices nationwide where we conduct management leasing construction and investment activities at december 31 2009 we had 380 employees and we believe that our relations with our employees are good 

compliance with governmental regulations 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate certain hazardous or toxic substances at our shopping centers these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances the cost of required remediation and the owner’s liability for remediation could exceed the value of the property andor the aggregate assets of the owner the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral we have a number of properties that could require or are currently undergoing varying levels of environmental remediation environmental remediation is not currently expected to have a material financial impact on us due to reserves for remediation insurance programs designed to mitigate the cost of remediation and various stateregulated programs that shift the responsibility and cost to the state

 item 1a risk factors tableend risk factors related to our industry and real estate investments 

our revenues and cash flow could be adversely affected by poor market conditions where our properties are geographically concentrated 

our performance depends on the economic conditions in markets in which our properties are concentrated during the year ended december 31 2009 our properties in california florida and texas accounted for 320 136 and 154 respectively of our consolidated net operating income our revenues and cash available for distribution to stock and unit holders could be adversely affected by this geographic concentration if market conditions such as supply of retail space or demand for shopping centers deteriorate in california florida and texas relative to other geographic areas 

loss of revenues from major tenants could reduce distributions to stock and unit holders 

we derive significant revenues from anchor tenants such as kroger publix and safeway that occupy more than one center kroger publix and safeway are our three largest tenants and accounted for 49 42 and 37 respectively of our annualized base rent on a prorata basis for the year ended december 31 2009 distributions to stock and unit holders could be adversely affected by the loss of revenues in the event a major tenant 

 

  

  

  

  

 vacated anchor space including space owned by the anchor can reduce rental revenues generated by the shopping center because of the loss of the departed anchor tenant’s customer drawing power most anchors have the right to vacate and prevent retenanting by paying rent for the balance of the lease term if major tenants vacate a property then other tenants may be entitled to terminate their leases at the property 

our net income depends on the success and continued presence of our tenants 

our net income could be adversely affected if we fail to lease significant portions of our new developments or in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of any anchors or of a significant number of our nonanchor tenants within a shopping center the adverse impact on our net income may be greater than the loss of rent from the resulting unoccupied space because cotenancy clauses may allow other tenants to modify or terminate their rent or lease obligations cotenancy clauses have several variants they may allow a tenant to postpone a store opening if certain other tenants fail to open their store they may allow a tenant the opportunity to close their store prior to lease expiration if another tenant closes their store prior to lease expiration or more commonly they may allow a tenant to pay reduced levels of rent until a certain number of tenants open their stores within the same shopping center as the current recession continues to depress retail sales we could experience reductions in rent and occupancy related to tenants exercising their cotenancy clauses 

downturns in the retail industry likely will have a direct adverse impact on our revenues and cash flow 

our properties consist primarily of groceryanchored shopping centers our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space the market for retail space has been or could be adversely affected by any of the following 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 to the extent that any of these conditions occur they are likely to impact market rents for retail space occupancy in the operating portfolios our ability to recycle capital and our cash available for distributions to stock and unit holders 

our real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges 

on a periodic basis we assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our real estate properties and other investments may be impaired a property’s value is impaired only if our estimate of the aggregate future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges to be generated by the property are less than the carrying value of the property if the aggregate future cash flows are less than the carrying value of property we write down the property to its fair value in our estimate of cash flows we consider factors such as expected future operating income trends and prospects the effects of demand competition and other factors we are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of our real estate properties and other investments these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment charge results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income there can be no assurance that we will not take additional charges in the future related to the impairment of our assets any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the charge is taken 

unsuccessful development activities or a slowdown in development activities could reduce distributions to stock and unit holders 

we actively pursue development activities as opportunities arise development activities require various government and other approvals for entitlements which can significantly delay the development process we may not recover our investment in development projects for which approvals are not received we incur other risks associated with development activities including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if developments are unsuccessful funding provided from sales to coinvestment partnerships and third parties may be materially reduced and our cash flow available for distribution to stock and unit holders will be reduced our earnings and cash flow available for distribution to stock and unit holders also may be reduced if we experience a significant slowdown in our development activities 

  

we may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or releasing space 

we derive most of our revenue directly or indirectly from rent received from our tenants we are subject to the risks that upon expiration or termination of leases whether by their terms as a result of a tenant bankruptcy or otherwise leases for space in our properties may not be renewed space may not be released or the terms of renewal or release including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable than current lease terms as a result our results of operations and our net income could be reduced 

many real estate costs are fixed even if income from our properties decreases 

our financial results depend primarily on leasing space in our properties to tenants on terms favorable to us costs associated with real estate investment such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs generally are not reduced even when a property is not fully occupied rental rates decrease or other circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property as a result cash flow from the operations of our properties may be reduced if a tenant does not pay its rent or we are unable to rent our properties on favorable terms under those circumstances we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal costs additionally new properties that we may acquire or develop may not produce any significant revenue immediately and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with such new properties until they are fully leased 

we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly we may not be able to alter our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions including being unable to sell a property at a return we believe is appropriate due to the current economic environment our inability to respond quickly to adverse changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our stock and unit holders 

we carry comprehensive liability fire flood extended coverage rental loss and environmental insurance for our properties with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties we believe that the insurance carried on our properties is adequate and in accordance with industry standards there are however some types of losses such as from hurricanes terrorism wars or earthquakes which may be uninsurable or the cost of insuring against such losses may not be economically justifiable if an uninsured loss occurs we could lose both the invested capital in and anticipated revenues from the property but we would still be obligated to repay any recourse mortgage debt on the property in that event our distributions to stock and unit holders could be reduced 

adverse global market and economic conditions may continue to adversely affect us and could cause us to recognize additional impairment charges or otherwise harm our performance 

ongoing adverse market and economic conditions and market volatility will likely continue to make it difficult to value the properties and investments owned by us and our joint ventures there may be significant uncertainty in the valuation or in the stability of the value of such properties and investments that could result in a substantial decrease in the value thereof no assurance can be given that we will be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our properties investments and intangibles and those of our joint ventures in the future our failure to do so would require us to recognize additional impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion which could materially and adversely affect us and the market price of our common stock 

we are unable to predict whether or to what extent or for how long these adverse market and economic conditions will persist the continuation andor intensification of these conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flow to pay expenses maintain properties pay dividends distributions and refinance debt 

we face competition from numerous sources 

the ownership of shopping centers is highly fragmented with less than 10 owned by reit’s we face competition from other reit’s as well as from numerous small owners in the acquisition ownership and leasing of shopping centers we compete to develop shopping centers with other real estate investment trusts engaged in development activities as well as with local regional and national real estate developers 

  

we compete for the acquisition of properties through proprietary research that identifies opportunities in markets with high barriers to entry and higherthanaverage population growth and household income we seek to maximize rents per square foot by i establishing relationships with supermarket chains that are first or second in their markets or other categoryleading anchors and ii leasing nonanchor space in multiple centers to national or regional tenants we compete to develop properties by applying our proprietary research methods to identify development and leasing opportunities and by preleasing a significant portion of a center before beginning construction 

there can be no assurance however that other real estate owners or developers will not utilize similar research methods and target the same markets and anchor tenants these entities may successfully control these markets and tenants to our exclusion if we cannot successfully compete in our targeted markets our cash flow and therefore distributions to stock and unit holders may be adversely affected 

costs of environmental remediation could reduce our cash flow available for distribution to stock and unit holders 

under various federal state and local laws an owner or manager of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on the property these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances the cost of any required remediation could exceed the value of the property andor the aggregate assets of the owner 

we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers and underground petroleum storage tanks ust’s the presence of or the failure to properly remediate hazardous or toxic substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a contaminated property or to borrow using the property as collateral any of these developments could reduce cash flow and distributions to stock and unit holders 

risk factors related to our coinvestment partnerships and acquisition structure 

we do not have voting control over our joint venture investments so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued 

we have invested as a coventurer in the acquisition or development of properties these investments involve risks not present in a whollyowned project we do not have voting control over the ventures the other coventurer might i have interests or goals that are inconsistent with our interests or goals or ii otherwise impede our objectives the other coventurer also might become insolvent or bankrupt 

our coinvestment partnerships are an important part of our growth strategy the termination of our coinvestment partnerships could adversely affect distributions to stock and unit holders 

our management fee income has increased significantly as our participation in coinvestment partnerships has increased if coinvestment partnerships owning a significant number of properties were dissolved for any reason we would lose the asset and property management fees from these coinvestment partnerships which could adversely affect our cash available for distribution to stock and unit holders 

in addition termination of the coinvestment partnerships without replacing them with new coinvestment partnerships could adversely affect our growth strategy property sales to the coinvestment partnerships provide us with an important source of funding for additional developments and acquisitions without this source of capital our ability to recycle capital fund developments and acquisitions and increase distributions to stock and unit holders could be adversely affected 

our coinvestment partnerships have 25 billion of debt as of december 31 2009 of which 548 will mature through 2012 which is subject to significant refinancing risks we anticipate that as real estate values decline the refinancing of maturing loans including those maturing in our joint ventures will require us and our joint venture partners to contribute our respective prorata shares of capital in order to reduce refinancing requirements to acceptable loan to value levels required for new financings the longterm impact of the current economic crisis on our ability to access capital including access by our joint venture partners or to obtain future financing to fund maturing debt is unclear 

  

our partnership structure may limit our flexibility to manage our assets 

we invest in retail shopping centers through the operating partnership in which the parent company currently owns 99 of the outstanding common partnership units from time to time we have acquired properties through the operating partnership in exchange for limited partnership interests this acquisition structure may permit limited partners who contribute properties to us to defer some if not all of the income tax liability that they would incur if they sold the property for cash 

properties contributed to the operating partnership may have unrealized gains attributable to the difference between the fair market value and adjusted tax basis in the properties prior to contribution as a result our sale of these properties could cause adverse tax consequences to the limited partners who contributed them 

generally the operating partnership has no obligation to consider the tax consequences of its actions to any limited partner however the operating partnership may acquire properties in the future subject to material restrictions on refinancing or resale designed to minimize the adverse tax consequences to the limited partners who contribute those properties these restrictions could significantly reduce our flexibility to manage our assets by preventing us from reducing mortgage debt or selling a property when such a transaction might be in our best interest in order to reduce interest costs or dispose of an underperforming property 

risk factors related to our capital recycling and capital structure 

lack of available credit could reduce capital available for new developments and other investments and could increase refinancing risks 

the lack of available credit in the commercial real estate market is causing a decline in the sale of shopping centers and their values this reduces the available capital for new developments or other new investments which is a key part of our capital recycling strategy the lack of liquidity in the capital markets has also resulted in a significant increase in the cost to refinance maturing loans and a significant increase in refinancing risks we anticipate that as real estate values decline refinancing maturing secured loans including those maturing in our joint ventures may require us and our joint venture partners to contribute our respective prorata shares of capital in order to reduce refinancing requirements to acceptable loan to value levels required for new financings whether the credit markets will hinder our ability to access capital including access by our joint venture partners or to obtain future financing to fund maturing debt is unclear 

a reduction in the availability of capital an increase in the cost of capital and higher market capitalization rates could adversely impact our ability to recycle capital and fund developments and acquisitions and could dilute earnings 

as part of our capital recycling program we sell operating properties that no longer meet our investment standards we also develop certain retail centers because of their attractive margins with the intent of selling them to coinvestment partnerships or other third parties for a profit these sales proceeds are used to fund the construction of new developments an increase in market capitalization rates could cause a reduction in the value of centers identified for sale which would have an adverse impact on our capital recycling program by reducing the amount of cash generated and profits realized in order to meet the cash requirements of our development program we may be required to sell more properties than initially planned which would have a negative impact on our earnings 

our debt financing may reduce distributions to stock and unit holders 

we do not expect to generate sufficient funds from operations to make balloon principal payments on our debt when due if we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms we might be forced i to dispose of properties which might result in losses or ii to obtain financing at unfavorable terms either could reduce the cash flow available for distributions to stock and unit holders 

in addition if we cannot make required mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose on the property securing the mortgage causing the loss of cash flow from that property furthermore substantially all of our debt is crossdefaulted which means that a default under one loan could trigger defaults under other loans 

our organizational documents do not limit the amount of debt that may be incurred the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences including the following 

  

  

  

 covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition 

our revolving line of credit and our unsecured notes contain customary covenants including compliance with financial ratios such as ratios of total debt to gross asset value and coverage ratios coverage ratio is defined as ebitda divided by the sum of the gross interest and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders our line of credit also restricts our ability to enter into a transaction that would result in a change of control these covenants may limit our operational flexibility and our acquisition activities moreover if we breach any of the covenants in our debt agreements including the covenants above and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately even in the absence of a payment default many of our debt arrangements including our unsecured notes unsecured line of credit and our revolving credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our stock 

we depend on external sources of capital which may not be available in the future 

to qualify as a reit the parent company must among other things distribute to its stockholders each year at least 90 of its reit taxable income excluding any net capital gains because of these distribution requirements we likely will not be able to fund all future capital needs including capital for acquisitions or developments with income from operations we therefore will have to rely on thirdparty sources of capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all our access to thirdparty sources of capital depends on a number of things including the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings in addition our line of credit imposes covenants that limit our flexibility in obtaining other financing such as a prohibition on negative pledge agreements 

additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders’ interests and additional debt financing may substantially increase our degree of leverage 

settlement provisions contained in forward sale agreements subject us to certain risks 

the company entered into forward sale agreements in december 2009 with each of jp morgan securities inc and wells fargo securities llc the forward sale agreements relate to the forward sale by the company of a number of shares of common stock equal to the number of shares of common stock to be borrowed and sold by each forward seller depending on the price of our common stock at the time of settlement and the relevant settlement method we may receive proceeds from the sale of common stock upon settlement of the forward sale agreements which settlement must occur within approximately 15 months after december 2009 we intend to use any proceeds that we receive upon settlement of the forward sale agreements to repay or refinance maturing 2010 debt which may include a portion of our prorata share of the existing mortgage debt of macquarie countrywideregency ii llc as the debt comes due beginning in 2010 and other general corporate purposes which may include the payment of future maturing debt or the acquisition of additional properties 

each forward purchaser has the right to accelerate its respective forward sale agreement and require us to physically settle its forward sale agreement on a date specified by such forward purchaser upon the occurrence of certain events each forward purchaser’s decision to exercise its right to require us to settle its forward sale agreement will be made irrespective of our interests including our need for capital in such cases we could be required to issue and deliver our common stock under the terms of the physical settlement provisions of the relevant forward sale agreement irrespective of our capital needs which would result in dilution to our earnings per share and unit and return on equity in addition upon certain events of bankruptcy insolvency or reorganization relating to 

  

us the forward sale agreements will terminate without further liability of either party following any such termination we would not issue any shares and we would not receive any proceeds pursuant to the forward sale agreements 

the forward sale agreements provide for settlement on a settlement date or dates to be specified at our discretion within approximately 15 months from december 7 2009 each forward sale agreement will be physically settled unless we elect to settle such forward sale agreement in cash if we decide to physically settle a forward sale agreement delivery of our shares on any physical settlement of such forward sale agreement will result in dilution to our earnings per share and unit and return on equity if we elect cash settlement for all or a portion of the shares of our common stock included in a forward sale agreement we would expect the relevant forward purchaser or one of its affiliates to repurchase a number of shares equal to the portion for which we elect cash settlement in order to cover its obligation to return the shares of our common stock it had borrowed in connection with sales of our common stock if the market value of our common stock at the time of the repurchase is above the forward price we would pay the relevant forward purchaser under such forward sale agreement an amount in cash equal to the difference thus we would be responsible for a potentially substantial cash payment 

in addition the purchase of our common stock by the forward purchasers or their respective affiliates to unwind their hedge positions could cause the price of our common stock to increase over time thereby increasing the amount of cash we would owe to the forward purchasers upon a cash settlement of the forward sale agreements 

risk factors related to interest rates and the market for our stock 

we may be forced to deleverage our business with our operating cash flows which could result in the reduction of distributions to our stock and unit holders a reduction in investments into our business or additional equity offerings that dilute our stock and unit holders’ interests 

we depend on external financing principally debt financing to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt our access to financing depends on our credit rating the willingness of creditors to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets the disruption in the capital markets that began in 2008 has continued into 2009 limiting access to financing for many companies without access to external financing we would be required to pay outstanding debt with our operating cash flows and our operating cash flows may not be sufficient to pay our outstanding debt as it comes due if we are required to deleverage our business with operating cash flows we may be forced to reduce the amount of or eliminate altogether our distributions to stock and unit holders or refrain from making investments in our business 

we and our joint ventures have a significant amount of debt maturing in 2010 2011 and 2012 during this time period we have 6247 million maturing and our joint ventures have 13 billion maturing our prorata share is 3338 million in addition to finding creditors willing to lend to us we are dependent upon our joint venture partners to contribute their share of any amount needed to repay or refinance existing debt when lenders reduce the amount of debt our joint ventures are refinancing 

increased interest rates may reduce distributions to stock and unit holders 

we are obligated on floating rate debt of which we had 56 million as of december 31 2009 if we do not eliminate our exposure to increases in interest rates through interest rate protection or cap agreements these increases may reduce cash flow and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders 

although swap agreements enable us to convert floating rate debt to fixed rate debt and cap agreements enable us to cap our maximum interest rate they expose us to the risk that the counterparties to these hedge agreements may not perform which could increase our exposure to rising interest rates if we enter into swap agreements decreases in interest rates will increase our interest expense as compared to the underlying floating rate debt this could result in our making payments to unwind these agreements such as in connection with a prepayment of our floating rate debt 

increased market interest rates could reduce the parent company’s stock price 

the annual dividend rate on our common stock as a percentage of its market price may influence the trading price of our stock an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers to demand a higher annual dividend rate which could adversely affect the market price of our stock a decrease in the market price of our 

  

common stock could reduce our ability to raise additional equity in the public markets selling common stock at a decreased market price would have a dilutive impact on existing stockholders 

the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors many of which are out of our control including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these factors may cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of our financial condition results of operations business or prospects it is impossible to ensure that the market price of our common stock will not fall in the future 

risk factors related to federal income tax laws 

if the parent company fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes it would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 

we believe that we qualify for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes and we plan to operate so that we can continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit if we qualify as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on our income that we distribute currently to our stockholders many of the reit requirements however are highly technical and complex the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances some of which may not be totally within our control and some of which involve questions of interpretation for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income must come from specific passive sources like rent that are itemized in the reit tax laws there can be no assurance that the internal revenue service “irs” or a court would agree with the positions we have taken in interpreting the reit requirements we are also required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains the fact that we hold many of our assets through coinvestment partnerships and their subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status furthermore congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult or impossible for us to remain qualified as a reit 

also unless the irs granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we would remain disqualified as a reit for four years following the year we first failed to qualify if we failed to qualify as a reit we would have to pay significant income taxes and this would likely have a significant adverse affect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to pay any dividends to stockholders 

even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we are required to pay certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from “prohibited transactions” that income will be subject to a 100 tax in general prohibited transactions include sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business the determination as to whether a 

  

particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale while we have undertaken a significant number of asset sales in recent years we do not believe that those sales should be considered prohibited transactions but there can be no assurance that the irs would not contend otherwise 

in addition any net taxable income earned directly by our taxable affiliates including regency realty group inc “rrg” our taxable reit subsidiary is subject to federal and state corporate income tax several provisions of the laws applicable to reit’s and their subsidiaries ensure that a taxable reit subsidiary will be subject to an appropriate level of federal income taxation for example a taxable reit subsidiary is limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to an affiliated reit in addition a reit has to pay a 100 penalty tax on some payments that it receives if the economic arrangements between the reit the reit’s tenants and the taxable reit subsidiary are not comparable to similar arrangements between unrelated parties finally some state and local jurisdictions may tax some of our income even though as a reit we are not subject to federal income tax on that income to the extent that we and our affiliates are required to pay federal state and local taxes we will have less cash available for dividends to our stockholders 

a reit may not own securities in any one issuer if the value of those securities exceeds 5 of the value of the reit’s total assets or the securities owned by the reit represent more than 10 of the issuer’s outstanding voting securities or 10 of the value of the issuer’s outstanding securities an exception to these tests allows a reit to own securities of a subsidiary that exceed the 5 value test and the 10 value tests if the subsidiary elects to be a “taxable reit subsidiary” we are not able to own securities of taxable reit subsidiaries that represent in the aggregate more than 25 of the value of our total assets we currently own more than 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of rrg 

risk factors related to our ownership limitations and the florida business corporation act 

restrictions on the ownership of the parent company’s capital stock to preserve our reit status could delay or prevent a change in control 

ownership of more than 7 by value of our outstanding capital stock by certain persons is restricted for the purpose of maintaining our qualification as a reit with certain exceptions this 7 limitation may discourage a change in control and may also i deter tender offers for our capital stock which offers may be attractive to our stockholders or ii limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their capital stock that might otherwise exist if an investor attempted to assemble a block in excess of 7 of our outstanding capital stock or to effect a change in control 

the issuance of the parent company’s capital stock could delay or prevent a change in control 

our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to 30000000 shares of preferred stock and 10000000 shares of special common stock and to establish the preferences and rights of any shares issued the issuance of preferred stock or special common stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control even if a change in control were in our stockholders’ interest the provisions of the florida business corporation act regarding control share acquisitions and affiliated transactions could also deter potential acquisitions by preventing the acquiring party from voting the common stock it acquires or consummating a merger or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of our disinterested stockholders

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview of our strategy 

regency centers corporation the “parent company” began its operations as a real estate investment trust “reit” in 1993 and is the managing general partner in regency centers lp the “operating partnership” the term “the company” or “regency” means the parent company and the operating partnership collectively our key strategic goals are focused on total share and unit holder return in excess of peer indices and sustaining growth in net asset value and earnings we will achieve these goals through owning operating and investing in a highquality portfolio of primarily groceryanchored shopping centers that are tenanted by marketdominant grocers categoryleading anchors specialty retailers and restaurants located in areas with above average household incomes and population densities all of our operating investing and financing activities are performed through the operating partnership its whollyowned subsidiaries and through its investments in real estate partnerships with third parties also referred to as coinvestment partnerships or joint ventures the parent company currently owns 99 of the outstanding common partnership units of the operating partnership because of our structure and certain public debt financing the operating partnership is also a registrant 

at december 31 2009 we directly owned 216 shopping centers the “consolidated properties” located in 23 states representing 230 million square feet of gross leasable area “gla” our cost of these shopping centers and those under development is 39 billion before depreciation through coinvestment partnerships we own partial ownership interests in 184 shopping centers the “unconsolidated properties” located in 25 states and the district of columbia representing 220 million square feet of gla our investment in the partnerships that own the unconsolidated properties is 3262 million certain portfolio information described below is presented a on a combined basis which is a total of the consolidated properties and the unconsolidated properties b for our consolidated properties only and c for the unconsolidated properties that we own through coinvestment partnerships we believe that presenting the information under these methods provides a more complete understanding of the properties that we whollyown versus those that we indirectly own through entities we do not control but for which we provide asset management property management leasing investing and financing services the shopping center portfolio that we manage on a combined basis represents 400 shopping centers located in 28 states and the district of columbia and contains 450 million square feet of gla 

we earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to grocery stores major retail anchors sideshop retailers and restaurants including ground leasing or selling building pads outparcels to these same types of tenants historically we have experienced growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates in our existing shopping centers and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers our shopping centers generate substantial daily traffic by conveniently offering necessities and services this high traffic generates increased sales thereby driving higher occupancy and rentalrate growth which we expect will provide sustained growth in earnings per share and unit and net asset value over the long term 

we seek a range of strong national regional and local specialty retailers for the same reason that we choose to anchor our centers with leading grocers and major retailers who provide a mix of goods and services that meet consumer needs we have created a formal partnering process the premier customer initiative “pci” to promote mutually beneficial relationships with our sideshop retailers the objective of pci is for us to build a base of nonanchor tenants who represent the “bestinclass” operators in their respective merchandising categories such retailers reinforce the consumer appeal and other strengths of a center’s anchor help grow and stabilize a center’s occupancy reduce releasing downtime reduce tenant turnover and yield higher sustainable rents 

the recession that ended in 2009 had a significant negative impact on our 2009 operating results during 2009 we experienced less tenant demand for vacant space as well as a higher level of retail store closings although the rate of closure appears to be slowing our rent collection losses increased in most 

  

of our shopping centers and markets as we experienced a higher level of tenants defaulting on their leases a result of lower retail sales these factors contributed to a decline in our occupancy percentages new leasing rental rates and rental revenues at december 31 2009 our operating portfolio of shopping centers including our prorata share of our coinvestment partnerships were 931 leased as compared to 938 at the end of 2008 and 950 leased at the end of 2007 increasing occupancy in our shopping centers to historical levels of 95 is a key objective of our strategic plan that should generate substantial growth in our future earnings and net asset value but will likely require several years to accomplish 

we continue to closely monitor tenants who have cotenancy clauses in their lease agreements these tenants are typically located in larger format community shopping centers that contain multiple anchor tenants whose leases contain these types of clauses cotenancy clauses have several variants they may allow a tenant to postpone a store opening if certain other tenants fail to open their store they may allow a tenant the opportunity to close their store prior to lease expiration if another tenant closes their store prior to lease expiration or more commonly they may allow a tenant to pay reduced levels of rent until a certain number of tenants open their stores within the same shopping center as the weak economy continues to depress retail sales we could experience further reductions in rent and occupancy related to tenants exercising their cotenancy clauses 

during 2009 we experienced a higher tenant default rate as compared to previous years due to a national decline in retail sales these defaults were primarily local tenants which are generally defined as tenants operating five or fewer stores such as restaurants fitness centers dry cleaners and tanning salons we are closely monitoring the operating performance collections and sales of all of the tenants in our shopping centers especially those tenants operating retail formats that are experiencing significant changes in competition business practice reductions in sales and store closings in other locations we expect that as the current economy remains weak additional retailers will announce store closings andor bankruptcies that could negatively impact our shopping centers 

we grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions of operating centers and shopping center development we will continue to use our unique combination of development capabilities market presence and anchor relationships to invest in valueadded opportunities sourced from distressed owners the redevelopment of existing centers developing land that we already own and other opportunities development is customer driven meaning we generally have an executed lease from the anchor before we start construction developments serve the growth needs of our anchors and specialty retailers resulting in modern shopping centers with longterm anchor leases that produce attractive returns on our invested capital this development process typically requires three to five years from initial land or redevelopment acquisition through construction leaseup and stabilization of rental income but can take longer depending upon tenant demand for new stores and the size of the project 

in the near term fewer new store openings by retailers are resulting in reduced demand for new retail space and causing corresponding reductions in new leasing rental rates and development preleasing as a result we have scaled back our development program by decreasing the number of new projects started phasing existing developments that lack retail demand and decreasing overhead costs through reductions in force although our development program will continue to play a part of our long term business strategy new development projects will be rigorously evaluated in regard to the cost and availability of capital visibility of tenant demand to achieve a stabilized occupancy and sufficient investment returns 

we strive to maintain a conservative capital structure we will continue to cost effectively and opportunistically strengthen our balance sheet which should allow us to access various sources of capital to fund our future commitments we endeavor to continue improving our key financial ratios and to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets 816 of our consolidated real estate assets at december 31 2009 are unencumbered such assets allow us to access the secured and unsecured debt markets and maintain significant availability on our 7138 million line of credit commitment which had no outstanding balance at december 31 2009 our debt to asset ratio before the effect of accumulated depreciation including our prorata share of the debt and assets of joint ventures is 459 at december 31 

  

2009 which is favorably lower than our ratio at december 31 2008 of 500 if we were to repay a portion of our outstanding debt with our available cash balances our current debt to asset ratio would fall to 449 at december 31 2009 for the year ended 2009 our coverage ratio with our prorata share of our partnerships declined to 20 times as compared to 24 times in 2008 directly related to a reduction in our ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization which was negatively impacted by the recent recession we define our coverage ratio as ebitda divided by the sum of the gross interest and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders during 2009 standard and poor’s rating services lowered our corporate credit rating and senior unsecured debt rating from bbb to bbb primarily due to the decline in our coverage ratio and a negative retail outlook we plan to grow ebitda through growth in net operating income by returning the occupancy percentages in our shopping centers back to historic levels and by acquiring or developing shopping centers which in combination with a conservative capital structure should favorably impact our coverage ratio on a longterm basis 

capital recycling involves contributing shopping centers to coinvestment partnerships and culling nonstrategic assets from our real estate portfolio and selling those in the open market these sales proceeds are either reserved for future capital commitments related to in process development redevelopments or debt maturities or redeployed into even higherquality new developments or acquisitions that will generate sustainable revenue growth and attractive returns to the extent that we are unable to generate capital in excess of our current commitments we will reduce our new investment activity accordingly 

coinvestment partnerships provide us with a reliable capital source for shopping center acquisitions as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset management property management and other investing and financing services as asset manager we are engaged by our partners to apply similar operating investment and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the coinvestment partnerships as those applied to the portfolio that we whollyown coinvestment partnerships grow their shopping center investments through acquisitions from third parties or direct purchases from us although selling properties to coinvestment partnerships reduces our direct ownership interest it provides a source of capital that further strengthens our balance sheet while we continue to share to the extent of our ownership interest in the risks and rewards of shopping centers that meet our high quality standards and longterm investment strategy 

our coinvestment partnerships have significant levels of debt that mature through 2012 and are subject to significant borrowing risks if the capital markets again become unavailable as they were during the recent recession as a result of the declines in commercial real estate values over the past 18 months the refinancing of maturing loans will require us and our joint venture partners to each contribute our respective prorata share of capital to the joint ventures in order to reduce the amount of borrowing to acceptable loan to value levels which we expect will be required for new financings while we have to date successfully refinanced our maturing loans the weak us economy may hinder our ability to access capital including access by our joint venture partners or to obtain future financing to fund maturing debt while we believe that our joint venture partners have sufficient capital or access thereto for these future capital requirements we can provide no assurance that the weak economy will not inhibit their ability to access capital and meet their future funding commitments the impact to the company of a coinvestment partner defaulting on its share of a capital call is discussed below under “liquidity and capital resources” 

  

shopping center portfolio 

the following tables summarize general information related to our shopping center portfolio which we use to evaluate and monitor our performance 

 

  

    we seek to reduce our operating and leasing risks through diversification which we achieve by geographically diversifying our shopping centers avoiding dependence on any single property market or tenant and owning a portion of our shopping centers through coinvestment partnerships 

the following table summarizes our four largest tenants each of which is a grocery tenant occupying the shopping centers at december 31 2009 

 

  

    

the following table summarizes leasing activity in square feet “sf” for the year ended december 31 2009 for the combined properties and regency prorata gla in thousands 

 

  

   although base rent is supported by longterm lease contracts tenants who file bankruptcy are given the right to cancel any or all of their leases and close related stores or continue to operate in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues and tenant receivables we are closely monitoring industry trends and sales data to help us identify declines in retail categories or tenants who might be experiencing financial difficulties as a result of slowing sales lack of credit changes in retail formats or increased competition as a result of our findings we may reduce new leasing suspend leasing or curtail the allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements within a certain retail category or to a specific retailer 

as of december 31 2009 we had 82 video rental stores occupying our shopping centers on a combined basis that represent 67 million of annual base rent on a prorata basis blockbuster video represents the majority of our video rental leases with 71 stores and annual base rent of 57 million or 14 of our annualized base rent including our prorata share of 28 stores in the unconsolidated properties blockbuster has announced publicly that it will close many of its stores and we expect that during 2010 they will close some of the stores that they occupy in our shopping centers movie galleryhollywood video filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on february 2 2010 we currently have four movie galleryhollywood video stores occupying our shopping centers and we anticipate that these stores could close during 2010 the base rent associated with these four stores is insignificant to our annual base rent on a prorata basis 

during 2009 ej’s shoes eddie bauer bilo supermarkets ritz camerawolf cameraboater’s world the walking company and max  erma’s each filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and inkstop filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation of these 22 leases six leases have been assumed and 14 leases have been rejected the combined annual base rent on a prorata basis associated with these leases is approximately 13 million or less than 1 of our annual base rent on a prorata basis 

in january and february 2010 fili’s enterprises inc doing business as daphne’s cafe along with pizzeria uno and hollywood videomovie gallery filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection of these 20 leases none have been assumed and 11 leases have been rejected the combined annual 

  

base rent on a prorata basis associated with these leases is approximately 14 million or less than 1 of our annual base rent on a prorata basis 

we continue to monitor and communicate with those tenants who have announced store closings or are experiencing financial distress we expect as the weak economy continues additional retailers will announce store closings andor bankruptcies that could negatively impact our shopping centers while retail sales remain depressed we could experience further reductions in rent and occupancy related to tenants exercising their cotenancy clauses as discussed previously however we are not currently aware of the pending bankruptcy or announced store closings of any tenants in our shopping centers beyond those described above that would individually cause a material reduction in our revenues and no tenant represents more than 5 of our annual base rent on a prorata basis 

liquidity and capital resources 

our parent company has no capital commitments other than its guarantees of the commitments of our operating partnership which are discussed further below under contractual obligations the parent company will from time to time access the capital markets for the purpose of issuing new equity and will simultaneously contribute all of the offering proceeds to the operating partnership in exchange for additional partnership units any new debt is issued by our operating partnership or by our coinvestment partnerships accordingly the discussion below regarding liquidity and capital resources is presented on a consolidated basis for the company the following table summarizes net cash flows related to operating investing and financing activities of the company for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 in thousands 

 

 during 2009 we completed the following capital sourcing transactions 

 

  

  

  

 on december 31 2009 our cash balance was 995 million we operate our business such that we expect net cash provided by operating activities in combination with proceeds generated from gains realized on sales of development properties and land will provide the necessary funds to pay our 

  

scheduled mortgage loan principal payments capital expenditures necessary to maintain our shopping centers and distributions to our share and unit holders net cash provided by operating activities plus gains from the sale of development properties and land of 58 million 343 million and 639 million totaled 1997 million 2535 million and 2821 million for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively during the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 we incurred capital expenditures to maintain our shopping centers of 144 million 154 million and 151 million we paid scheduled principal payments of 52 million 48 million and 45 million and we paid distributions of 1831 million 2229 million and 2043 million respectively during 2009 these expenditures and distributions exceeded our cash provided by operating activities and gains by 30 million due to a decline in our revenues and gains which is discussed further below under results from operations our board of directors anticipated these declines and accordingly reduced our quarterly dividend to 04625 per share and unit beginning in may 2009 from the previous 0725 paid in march 2009 our dividend distribution policy is set by our board of directors who continuously review our financial results and make decisions they believe prudent about distribution rates we plan to continue paying an aggregate amount of distributions to our stock and unit holders that at a minimum meet the requirements to continue qualifying as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

commitments available to us under our operating partnership’s unsecured line of credit the “line” and revolving credit facility total 7138 million as of february 26 2010 we had no balance outstanding on the line or the revolving credit facility the line is available to us through january 2011 at which time we have the option to extend 6000 million of the commitment to january 2012 based upon our ongoing discussions with our line banks we believe we will be able to successfully negotiate and extend the line at a commitment level sufficient to meet our working capital and investment needs when it matures 

we currently estimate that we will require approximately 9161 million through 2012 primarily to repay 6247 million of maturing debt complete inprocess developments and to fund our prorata share of estimated capital contributions to our coinvestment partnerships for repayment of debt included in these capital requirements are 5840 million of unsecured public debt as further described below under notes payable which we intend to repay at maturity from the proceeds of new unsecured issues to the extent that issuing unsecured debt is cost prohibitive or unavailable we believe that we have sufficient unsecured assets available for secured mortgage financing whose proceeds could be used to repay the unsecured debt at maturity when necessary the line is available to fund our capital needs also as mentioned previously we will receive 2358 million of net proceeds once we settle the 80 million common share forward equity offering in the future 

at december 31 2009 we had 40 properties under construction or undergoing major renovations on a combined basis which when completed will represent a net investment of 8207 million after projected sales of adjacent land and outparcels this compares to 45 properties that were under construction at december 31 2008 representing an investment of 9932 million upon completion we estimate that we will earn an average return on investment from our current development projects of 66 when completed and fully leased average returns have declined over previous years’ primarily as a result of longer lease up periods and reduced market rental rates costs necessary to complete the current development projects net of reimbursements and projected land sales are estimated to be approximately 341 million 

our joint ventures have 13 billion of secured mortgage loans and credit lines maturing through 2012 we believe that in order to refinance the maturing joint venture loans we along with our joint venture partners will be required to contribute our prorata share of the capital necessary to reduce the amount of borrowings to acceptable loan to value levels required for this type of financing we currently estimate that we will contribute approximately 2064 million to our joint ventures through 2012 for our prorata share of the repayment of maturing debt net of the proceeds from new debt issues and we estimate our joint venture partners will contribute 3048 million for their share a more detailed loan maturity schedule is included below under notes payable 

we believe that our joint venture partners are financially sound and have sufficient capital or 

  

access thereto to fund future capital requirements we communicate with our coinvestment partners regularly regarding the operating and capital budgets of our coinvestment partnerships and believe that we will successfully complete the refinancing of our joint venture debt as it matures in the event that a coinvestment partner was unable to fund its share of the capital requirements of the coinvestment partnership we would have the right but not the obligation to loan the defaulting partner the amount of its capital call at an interest rate at the lesser of prime plus a predefined spread or the maximum rate allowed by law a decision to loan to a defaulting joint venture partner which would be secured by the defaulting partner’s partnership interest would be based on the fair value of the coinvestment partnership assets our joint venture partner’s financial health and would be subject to an evaluation of our own capital commitments and sources to fund those commitments alternatively should we determine that our joint venture partners will not have sufficient capital to meet future capital needs we could trigger liquidation of the partnership for the coinvestment partnerships that have distributioninkind “dik” provisions and own multiple properties a liquidation of the coinvestment partnership could be completed by either a dik of the properties to each joint venture partner in proportion to its partnership interest open market sale or a combination of both methods our coinvestment partnership properties have been financed with nonrecourse loans that represent 99 of the total debt of the coinvestment partnerships at december 31 2009 including lines of credit we and our partners have no guarantees related to these loans in those coinvestment partnerships which have dik provisions if we trigger liquidation by distribution in kind each partner would receive title to properties selected in a rotation process for distribution and would assume any related loans secured by the properties distributed the loan agreements generally provide for assumption by either joint venture partner after obtaining any required lender consent we would only be responsible for those loans we assume through the dik and only to the extent of the value of the property we receive since after assumption through the dik the loans would remain nonrecourse we also have a 50 investment interest in a single asset joint venture with an 85 million loan which contains guarantees from each partner limited however to their respective interest 

our preferred stock and preferred units though callable by us are not redeemable in cash at the option of the holders 

although common or preferred equity raised in the public markets by the parent company is an option to fund future capital needs access to these markets could be limited at times during 2009 we successfully completed 6079 million of common stock offerings when conditions for the issuance of equity are acceptable we will evaluate issuing equity to fund new acquisition opportunities fund new developments or repay maturing debt at december 31 2009 the parent company and the operating partnership each had existing shelf registration statements available for the issuance of new equity or debt securities respectively 

investments in real estate partnerships 

we account for certain investments in real estate partnerships using the equity method we have determined that these investments are not variable interest entities and do not require consolidation under financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” topic 810 and therefore are subject to the voting interest model in determining our basis of accounting major decisions including property acquisitions not meeting preestablished investment criteria dispositions financings annual budgets and dissolution of the joint ventures are subject to the approval of all partners 

recognition of gains from sales to coinvestment partnerships is recorded on only that portion of the sales not attributable to our ownership interest unless there are certain provisions in the partnership agreement which allow the company a unilateral right to initiate a dik upon liquidation as described further below under our critical accounting policies and note 1b summary of significant accounting policies in our consolidated financial statements each included herein the presence of such dik provisions requires that we apply a more restrictive method of gain recognition “restricted gain method” on sales of properties to these coinvestment partnerships this method considers our potential ability to receive property through a dik on which partial gain has been recognized and ensures maximum gain deferral upon sale to a coinvestment partnership containing these unilateral dik rights “dikjv” 

  

the operations and gains related to properties sold to our investments in real estate partnerships are not classified as discontinued operations because we continue to provide to these shopping centers property management services under market rate agreements with our coinvestment partnerships for those properties acquired by the joint venture from unrelated parties we are required to contribute our prorata share based on our ownership interest of the purchase price to the coinvestment partnerships 

at december 31 2009 we had investments in real estate partnerships of 3262 million the following table is a summary of unconsolidated combined assets and liabilities of these coinvestment partnerships and our prorata share see note below at december 31 2009 and 2008 dollars in thousands

during 2008 we entered into a 3415 million term loan facility the “term facility” under an agreement with wells fargo bank and a syndicate of other banks that matures in february 2011 the term facility originally included a term loan of 2277 million plus a 1138 million revolving credit facility in december 2009 we paid off the balance of the term loan and it is no longer available to us however the revolving credit facility remains available to us at our discretion at december 31 2009 and 2008 the balance on the term facility was zero and 2277 million respectively at december 31 2009 the revolving credit facility had a variable interest rate equal to libor plus 100 basis points as compared to libor plus 90 basis points at december 31 2008 and an annual facility fee of 20 basis points subject to maintaining our corporate credit and senior unsecured ratings at bbb at december 31 2008 the term loan had a variable interest rate of 330 or libor plus 105 basis points 

on september 30 2009 standard and poor’s rating services lowered our corporate credit rating and senior unsecured debt rating to bbb from bbb primarily related to the reduction in our coverage ratio in 2009 as a result of this downgrade the interest rate on the line increased to libor plus 55 basis points and the interest rate on the revolving portion of the term facility increased to libor plus 100 basis points respectively effective october 1 2009 

including both the line commitment and the term facility collectively “unsecured credit facilities” we currently have 7138 million of total capacity and the interest rate spread paid is dependent upon our maintaining specific investmentgrade ratings we are also required to comply with certain financial covenants as defined in the credit agreement such as minimum net worth ratio of total liabilities to gross asset value “gav” and ratio of recourse secured indebtedness to gav ratio of ebitda to fixed charges and other covenants customary with this type of unsecured financing as of december 31 2009 management believes we are in compliance with all financial covenants for our unsecured credit facilities our unsecured credit facilities are used to finance the acquisition and development of real estate and for general workingcapital purposes

payment was funded from available cash and we recorded a loss of 27 million for this early extinguishment of debt 

outstanding debt at december 31 2009 and 2008 consists of the following in thousands 

 

 at december 31 2009 997 of our total debt had fixed interest rates compared with 858 at december 31 2008 we intend to limit the percentage of variable interest rate debt to be no more than 30 of total debt which we believe to be an acceptable risk currently our variable rate debt represents less than 1 of our total debt 

the carrying value of our variable rate notes payable and the unsecured credit facilities are based upon a spread above libor which is lower than the spreads available in the current credit market causing the fair value of such variable rate debt to be below its carrying value the fair value of fixed rate loans are estimated using cash flows discounted at current market rates available to us for debt with similar terms and maturities fixed rate loans assumed in connection with real estate acquisitions are recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements at fair value at the time of acquisition excluding those loans assumed in dik liquidations which are assumed at carrying value based on the estimates used the fair value of notes payable and the unsecured credit facilities is approximately 14 billion and 13 billion at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

as of december 31 2009 scheduled principal repayments on notes payable and the unsecured credit facilities were as follows in thousands 

 

 at december 31 2009 our investments in real estate partnerships had notes payable of 25 billion maturing through 2028 of which 970 had weighted average fixed interest rates of 56 the remaining notes payable had variable interest rates based on libor plus a spread in a range of 145 to 150 basis points our prorata share of these loans was 5855 million we and our partners have no guarantees related to these loans except for an 85 million loan related to our ownership interest in one single asset real estate partnership where we are only responsible for our prorata share of the loan as of december 31 2009 scheduled principal repayments on notes payable held by our investments in real estate partnerships were as follows in thousands 

  

 we are exposed to capital market risk such as changes in interest rates in order to manage the volatility related to interest rate risk we originate new debt with fixed interest rates or we may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes on march 10 2006 we entered into four forwardstarting interest rate swaps totaling 3967 million with fixed rates of 5399 5415 5399 and 5415 on april 16 2009 we paid 200 million to partially settle 1060 million of the 3967 million interest rate swaps in place to hedge the 1060 million mortgage loan issued on july 1 2009 described previously for 907 million of the remaining swaps we continue to expect to issue new secured or unsecured debt for a term of 7 to 12 years prior to july 1 2010 for 2000 million of the remaining swaps we continue to expect to issue new debt for a term of 7 to 12 years during the period between march 31 2010 and march 31 2011 the fair value of these swaps was a liability of 284 million at december 31 2009 if we were to no longer expect to issue new debt within the terms and periods described above we would be required to immediately charge the change in the fair value of these swaps to net income as well as all future changes in value during december 2009 following the successful completion of our 80 million share common stock offering discussed previously we revised our assumptions of future debt issues by delaying a portion of our expected issuances into 2011 although we still expect to issue new debt within the time frames originally contemplated the change in our issuance assumptions caused a portion of our swaps to become ineffective due to an overhedged position and resulted in us recognizing a loss on hedge ineffectiveness of 33 million the valuation of these derivative instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives including the period to maturity and uses observable marketbased inputs including interest rate curves and implied volatilities we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements although we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize level 3 inputs such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by ourselves and our counterparties

critical accounting policies and estimates 

knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial statements the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities at a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period these accounting estimates are based upon but not limited to our judgments about historical results current economic activity and industry accounting standards they are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness however the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates 

revenue recognition and accounts receivable – accounts receivable represent revenues recognized in our financial statements and include base rent percentage rent and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs insurance and real estate taxes we analyze tenant receivables historical bad debt levels customer creditworthiness and current economic trends when 

  

evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts our reported net income loss is directly affected by our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable 

recognition of gains from the sales of real estate – profits from sales of real estate are not recognized under the full accrual method by us unless a sale is consummated the buyer’s initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property a receivable if applicable is not subject to future subordination we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership and we do not have substantial continuing involvement with the property 

we sell shopping center properties to joint ventures in exchange for cash equal to the fair value of the percentage interest acquired by our partners we have accounted for those sales as “partial sales” and recognized gains on those partial sales in the period the properties were sold to the extent of the percentage interest sold and in the case of certain joint venture partnerships we apply a more restrictive method of recognizing gains as discussed further below the gains and operations associated with properties sold to these joint venture partnerships are not classified as discontinued operations because we continue to partially own and manage these shopping centers 

certain dikjvs give either partner the unilateral right to elect to dissolve the joint venture partnership and upon such an election receive a distribution inkind of the assets of the joint venture partnership equal to its respective ownership interests the liquidation provisions require that all of the properties owned by the joint venture partnership be appraised to determine their respective and collective fair values as a general rule if we initiate the liquidation process our partner has the right to choose the first property that it will receive in liquidation and we have the right to choose the next property that we will receive in liquidation if our partner initiates the liquidation process the order of the selection process is reversed the process then continues with alternating selection of properties by each partner until the balance of each partner’s capital account on a fair value basis has been distributed after the final selection to the extent that the fair value of properties in the dikjv is not distributable in a manner that equals the balance of each partner’s capital account a cash payment would be made to the other partner by the partner receiving a fair value in excess of its capital account the partners may also elect to liquidate some or all of the properties through sales rather than through the dik process 

we have concluded that these dik dissolution provisions constitute insubstance callput options and represent a form of continuing involvement with respect to property that we sold to these joint venture partnerships limiting our recognition of gain related to the partial sale this more restrictive method of gain recognition the restricted gain method considers our potential ability to receive property through a dik on which partial gain has been recognized and ensures as discussed below maximum gain deferral upon sale to a dikjv we have applied the restricted gain method to partial sales of property to joint venture partnerships that contain such unilateral dik provisions 

profit shall be recognized by a method determined by the nature and extent of the seller’s continuing involvement and the profit recognized shall be reduced by the maximum exposure to loss we have concluded that the restricted gain method accomplishes this objective 

under the restricted gain method for purposes of gain deferral we consider the aggregate pool of properties sold into the dikjv as well as the aggregate pool of properties which will be distributed in the dik process as a result upon the sale of properties to a dikjv we perform a hypothetical dik liquidation analysis assuming that we would choose only those properties that we have sold to the dikjv in an amount equal to our capital account for purposes of calculating the gain to be deferred we assume that the company will select properties in a dik liquidation that would otherwise have generated the highest gain to us when originally sold to the dikjv and include for such determination the fair value in properties that could be received in excess of the company’s capital account the deferred gain to be recorded upon a sale of a property to a dikjv is calculated whenever a property is sold to the dikjv by us during the periods when there are no property sales to a dikjv the deferred gain is not recalculated 

because the contingency associated with the possibility of receiving a particular property back 

  

upon liquidation which forms the basis of the restricted gain method is not satisfied at the property level but at the aggregate level no gain is recognized on property sold by the dikjv to a third party or received by us upon actual dissolution instead the property received upon actual dissolution is recorded at the carrying value of our investment in the dikjv on the date of dissolution reduced by the deferred gain 

capitalization of costs – we capitalize the acquisition of land the construction of buildings and other specifically identifiable development costs incurred by recording them into properties in development in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets in summary a project changes from nonoperating to operating when it is substantially completed and held available for occupancy at that time costs are no longer capitalized other development costs include predevelopment costs essential to the development of the property as well as interest real estate taxes and direct employee costs incurred during the development period predevelopment costs are incurred prior to land acquisition during the due diligence phase and include contract deposits legal engineering and other professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center at december 31 2009 and 2008 we capitalized predevelopment costs of approximately 816000 and 77 million respectively of which approximately 325000 and 23 million respectively were refundable contract deposits if we determine that the development of a specific project undergoing due diligence is no longer probable we immediately expense all related capitalized predevelopment costs not considered recoverable during the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 we expensed predevelopment costs of approximately 38 million 155 million and 53 million respectively recorded in other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations interest costs are capitalized into each development project based on applying our weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the actual development costs expended we cease interest cost capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements but in no event would we capitalize interest on the project beyond 12 months after substantial completion of the building shell during the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 we capitalized interest of 191 million 365 million and 354 million respectively on our development projects we have a staff of employees the “investment group” who support our development program all direct internal costs attributable to these development activities are capitalized as part of each development project during the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 we capitalized 65 million 278 million and 390 million respectively of direct costs incurred by the investment group the capitalization of costs is directly related to the actual level of development activity occurring as a result of the current economic downturn development activity slowed significantly during 2009 resulting in a reduction in capitalized costs and a corresponding increase in general and administrative expenses as noncapitalized investment group costs were charged to earnings during 2009 we significantly reduced our investment group staff to adjust to a lower level of development activity expected in the future as compared to periods prior to 2009 if accounting standards issued in the future were to limit the amount of internal costs that may be capitalized we could incur additional increases in general and administrative expenses which would further reduce net income 

real estate acquisitions – upon acquisition of operating real estate properties we estimate the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land building and improvements and identify intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and belowmarket leases inplace leases and tenant relationships and assumed debt based on these estimates we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities we evaluate the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets each reporting period and account for any changes in estimated useful lives over the revised remaining useful life 

valuation of real estate investments – our longlived assets primarily real estate held for investment are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted if we determine that the carrying amount of a property is not recoverable we write down the asset to fair value for properties to be “held and used” for long term investment we estimate undiscounted future cash flows over the expected investment term 

  

including the estimated future value of the asset upon sale at the end of the investment period future value is generally determined by applying a marketbased capitalization rate to the estimated future net operating income in the final year of the expected investment term if after applying this method a property is determined to be impaired we determine the provision for impairment based upon current market resale values through comparable sales information and other market data if available or by applying a market capitalization rate to current estimated net operating income for properties “held for sale” we estimate current market resale values through appraisal less expected costs to sell a loss in value of an investment under the equity method of accounting which is other than a temporary decline must be recognized in the period in which the loss occurs in the case of our investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships we calculate the present value of our investment by discounting estimated future cash flows over the expected term of the investment methods of determining fair value can fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including changes in the general economy of those markets in which we operate our estimated holding period of the property tenant credit quality and demand for new retail stores if as a result of a change in our strategy for a specific property which we own directly or through our coinvestment partnerships a property previously classified as held and used is changed to held for sale or if its estimated holding period changes such change could cause us to determine that the property is impaired and a provision for impairment in relation to that property would be recorded by us either directly or through a reduction of our equity in income of real estate partnerships 

discontinued operations – the application of current accounting principles that govern the classification of any of our properties as heldforsale on the balance sheet or the presentation of results of operations and gains on the sale of these properties as discontinued requires management to make certain significant judgments we classify an operating property or a property in development as heldforsale when we determine that the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition the property is being actively marketed for sale and management believes it is probable that a sale will be consummated within one year given the nature of real estate sales contracts it is not unusual for such contracts to allow a contractual buyer a due diligence period to evaluate the property with the right to cancel the contract without any financial loss in addition certain other matters critical to the final sale such as financing arrangements often remain pending even upon contract acceptance as a result properties under contract may not close within the expected time period or may not close at all therefore any properties categorized as heldforsale represent only those properties that management has determined are likely to close within the requirements set forth above in order to determine if the results of operations and gain on sale should be reflected as discontinued operations prior to the sale we evaluate the extent of involvement and significance of cash flows the sale will have with a property after the sale any property sold in which we have significant continuing involvement or cash flows most often sales to coinvestment partnerships in which we continue to manage the property is not considered to be discontinued in addition any property which we sell to an unrelated third party but which we retain a property management function is not considered discontinued therefore only properties sold or to be sold to unrelated third parties where we will have no significant continuing involvement or significant cash flows are classified as discontinued and its operations including any mortgage interest and gain on sale are reported in discontinued operations so that the operations are clearly distinguished prior periods are also reclassified to reflect the operations of these properties as discontinued operations when we sell operating properties to our joint ventures or to third parties and will have continuing involvement the operations and gains on sales are included in income from continuing operations if circumstances arise that previously were considered unlikely and as a result we decide not to sell a property previously classified as held for sale the property is reclassified as held and used and is measured individually at the lower of its i carrying amount before the property was classified as held for sale adjusted for any depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held and used or ii the fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell any required adjustment to the carrying amount of the property reclassified as held and used is included in income from continuing operations in the period of the subsequent decision not to sell if a property is reclassified as held and used the results of operations of the property previously reported in discontinued operations are reclassified and included in income from continuing operations for all periods presented 

investments in real estate partnerships – in addition to owning real estate directly we invest in 

  

real estate through our coinvestment partnerships as asset and property manager we conduct the business of the unconsolidated properties held in the coinvestment partnerships in the same way that we conduct the business of the consolidated properties that are whollyowned therefore the critical accounting policies as described are also applicable to our investments in the real estate partnerships we account for all investments in which we do not have a controlling financial ownership interest using the equity method we have determined that these investments are not variable interest entities and do not require consolidation and therefore are subject to the voting interest model in determining our basis of accounting decisions including property acquisitions and dispositions financings certain leasing arrangements annual budgets and dissolution of the joint ventures are subject to the approval of all partners or in the case of the fund its advisory committee 

income tax status – the prevailing assumption underlying the operation of our business is that the parent company will continue to operate in order to qualify as a reit as defined under the internal revenue code the “code” the parent company is required to meet certain income and asset tests on a periodic basis to ensure that it continues to qualify as a reit as a reit the parent company is allowed to reduce taxable income by all or a portion of its distributions to stockholders we evaluate the transactions that we enter into and determine their impact on our reit status determining our taxable income calculating distributions and evaluating transactions requires us to make certain judgments and estimates as to the positions we take in our interpretation of the code because many types of transactions are susceptible to varying interpretations under federal and state income tax laws and regulations our positions are subject to change at a later date upon final determination by the taxing authorities however we reassess such positions at each reporting period 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in january 2010 the fasb issued accounting standards update “asu” no 201006 “fair value measurements and disclosures 820 – improving disclosures about fair value measurements” “asu 201006” asu 201006 provides amendments to subtopic 82010 and requires new disclosures for transfers in and out of levels 1 and 2 and activity in level 3 fair value measurements asu 201006 also clarifies existing disclosure requirements for the level of disaggregation for each class of assets and liabilities and for the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value asu 201006 is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after december 15 2009 except for the disclosures about purchases sales issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level 3 fair value measurements which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2010 and for interim periods within those fiscal years we adopted this asu on december 31 2009 

in december 2009 the fasb issued asu no 200917 “improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities” “asu 200917” asu 200917 was issued to reflect the amendments from statement 167 “amendments to fasb interpretation no 46r” as a revision to fasb interpretation no 46 revised december 2003 “consolidation of variable interest entities” asu 200917 changes how a reporting entity determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated the determination of whether a reporting entity is required to consolidate another entity is based on among other things the other entity’s purpose and design and the reporting entity’s ability to direct the activities of the other entity that most significantly impact the other entity’s economic performance asu 200917 was effective january 1 2010 and early application is not permitted we have evaluated the adoption of this asu and it will not have an effect on our results of operations or financial position as we do not currently have any variable interests that we believe would require consolidation 

results from operations – 2009 vs 2008 

comparison of the years ended december 31 2009 to 2008 

at december 31 2009 on a combined basis we were operating or developing 400 shopping centers as compared to 440 shopping centers at december 31 2008 the decline in properties is related to the liquidation of the assets of mcwr i where the properties were distributed through a dik to 

  

mcw and regency and in which we received six properties 

we identify our shopping centers as either properties in development or operating properties properties in development are defined as properties that are in the construction or leaseup process and have not reached their initial full occupancy a development property becomes an operating property at the earlier to occur of attaining 95 leased and rent paying or four years from the start of site work regardless of the  leased at december 31 2009 on a combined basis we had 40 development properties as compared to 45 properties at december 31 2008 

our revenues decreased by 67 million or 13 to 4892 million in 2009 as summarized in the following table in thousands 

 

 our decline in revenues was related to a onetime transaction fee earned and recognized in 2008 which is more fully described in the table and discussion below the increase in minimum rent relates primarily to new properties distributed to us as part of the mcwr i dik liquidation and new rent generated by the development properties in addition to collecting minimum rent from our tenants we also collect percentage rent from certain tenants based on their sales volumes which is lower than 2008 due to previous percentage rent tenants renewing their leases upon expiration and converting their percentage rent to higher base rent recoveries from tenants represent reimbursements from tenants for their prorata share of the operating maintenance and real estate tax expenses that we incur to operate our shopping centers recoveries from tenants were higher in 2009 due to increases in our operating expenses but our recoveries as a percentage of the expenses related only to our operating properties declined to 773 from 830 in 2008 as a result of a decline in our occupancy percentage and an increase in nonrecoverable expenses 

our operating properties excluding those in development on a prorata basis were 931 leased at december 31 2009 as compared to 938 at the end of 2008 our renewal rate of expiring leases was 747 for the year ended but rental rates on leases executed during 2009 declined 27 as compared to the previous rental rates earned on the same gla under previous leases during 2008 our renewal rate was 795 and rental rates on leases executed grew by 106 our lease renewal rates and rental growth rates in 2009 were severely impacted by the recent recession we anticipate that occupancy levels in our operating properties could fluctuate between 900 and 925 during 2010 and average rental rates on leases executed in 2010 could decline by 2 to 8 both of which could result in reduced revenues through 2010 

we earn fees at marketbased rates for asset management disposition property management leasing acquisition and financing services that we provide to our coinvestment partnerships and third parties as follows in thousands 

 

 asset management fees which are tied to the value of the real estate we manage in the coinvestment partnerships declined during 2009 due to an overall decline in commercial real estate values 

  

during the past 18 months and also due to a reduction in the number of joint venture partnership properties we manage as a result of the dik liquidation of mcwr i property management fees which are calculated based on a percentage of revenues earned in the joint venture partnerships declined as a result of an 116 decline in 2009 joint venture partnership revenues as compared to 2008 leasing commissions were higher in 2009 as we leased more space in 2009 as compared to 2008 however tenant moveouts on a square foot basis outpaced new leasing during 2009 causing a net decline in our occupancy rate the decrease in transaction fees relates to a 197 million portfolio incentive return fee earned and recognized in 2008 not recurring in 2009 during 2009 we received a 78 million disposition fee from mcw in relation to mcw’s partial sale of its investment in mcwr ii to gri 

our operating expenses increased by 303 million or 109 to 3080 million in 2009 the following table summarizes our operating expenses in thousands 

 

 increases in operating maintenance and real estate taxes along with depreciation and amortization expense are primarily related to the six properties distributed to us as part of the mcwr i dik liquidation during 2009 not included in the 2008 amounts 1113 million of recently completed developments commencing operations in the current year and general increases in expenses incurred by the operating properties general and administrative expense is 94 higher in 2009 primarily related to 75 million in severance and benefit payments associated with two reductions in force completed during 2009 offset by reductions in incentive compensation for not achieving targeted performance levels during 2009 we increased the allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for past due amounts reflecting to a significantly higher tenant default rate on rental payments as tenants struggled in a period of much lower consumer spending the decline in other expenses is due to a reduction in preacquisition development costs being written off as a result of much lower new development pursuit activity 

the following table presents the change in interest expense from 2009 to 2008 in thousands 

 

 interest on unsecured credit facilities decreased by 67 million as a result of lower average outstanding balances on our credit facilities in 2009 as compared to 2008 at december 31 2009 the balance of our line was zero we had repaid the term loan portion of our unsecured term facility and we completed a partial tender offer of outstanding unsecured debt interest on notes payable increased as a result of issuing 1060 million secured mortgage loans in addition to four mortgage loans assumed as part of the mcwr i dik liquidation capitalized interest declined as inprocess developments were completed during 2009 and new development activity declined 

during 2009 we sold 18 outparcels for net proceeds of 278 million and recognized a gain of approximately 219000 whereas during 2008 we sold 12 outparcels for net proceeds of 382 million and recognized a gain of 12 million during 2009 we also sold eight operating properties to the usaa 

  

partnership for net proceeds of 1033 million and recognized gains of 191 million recorded under the restricted gain method during 2008 we sold four properties to several joint ventures for net proceeds of 1105 million and recognized gains of 138 million recorded under the restricted gain method 

during the year ended december 31 2009 we recorded a provision for impairment of 1044 million of which 937 million related to land held for future development or sale during 2009 a prospective anchor tenant for several development sites expressed considerable uncertainty about the timing and location of future stores given the continuation of the weak economy and reductions in consumer spending as a result we reevaluated and reduced the probability of future development at these sites and accordingly reduced our carrying value in the land parcels to estimated fair value included in the impairment loss was a 102 million provision related to operating properties that became targeted for sale in the near future which caused us to reevaluate and reduce our expected holding periods for these assets and corresponding future cash flows we also recorded a reserve of 465000 on a note receivable in default during the year ended december 31 2008 we recorded a provision for impairment of 349 million of which 72 million related to land held for future development or sale 206 million related to operating properties 11 million related to a note receivable in default and 60 related to our investment in real estate partnerships 

our equity in income loss of investments in real estate partnerships decreased by 317 million during 2009 as follows in thousands 

 

  

  the decrease in our equity in income loss of investments in real estate partnerships is primarily related to a provision for impairment of 1044 million recognized by mcwr ii associated with multiple shopping centers that became targeted for sale in the near future our prorata share of this provision for impairment was 261 million excluding the impairment the declines in revenues or losses incurred by our coinvestment partnerships were directly related to reductions in operating revenues as occupancy levels declined in 2009 and to increased allowances for doubtful accounts as they also experienced a significantly higher tenant default rate during a difficult economic environment 

income from discontinued operations was 59 million for the year ended december 31 2009 related to the operations of shopping centers sold or classified as heldforsale in 2009 and 2008 whereas income from discontinued operations was 220 million for the year ended december 31 2008 income from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2009 includes gains from the sale of four properties in development for net proceeds of 298 million and gains of 56 million one operating 

  

property which was sold for net proceeds of 195 million and a gain of approximately 273000 and the operations of shopping centers sold or classified as heldforsale in 2009 and 2008 income from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2008 includes gains from the sale of seven properties in development for net proceeds of 553 million and gains of 140 million three operating properties which were sold for net proceeds of 309 million and gains of 35 million and the operations of shopping centers sold or classified as heldforsale in 2009 and 2008 if we sell a property or classify a property as heldforsale we are required to reclassify its operations into discontinued operations for all prior periods which results in a reclassification of amounts previously reported as continuing operations into discontinued operations 

related to our parent company’s results our net loss attributable to common stockholders for the year ended 2009 was 564 million a decrease of 1729 million as compared with net income of 1165 million in 2008 the decline in net income was primarily related to the 1044 million provision for impairment recorded in 2009 our 261 million prorata share of the provision for impairment recorded by mcwr ii and a reduction in gains from the sale of real estate during 2009 as compared to 2008 our diluted net loss per share was 074 in 2009 as compared to diluted net income per share of 166 in 2008 

related to our operating partnership results our net loss attributable to common unit holders for the year ended 2009 was 566 million a decrease 1740 million as compared with net income of 1174 million in 2008 for the same reasons stated above our diluted net loss per unit was 074 in 2009 as compared to net income per unit of 166 in 2008 

comparison of the years ended december 31 2008 to 2007 

our revenues increased by 599 million or 137 to 4959 million in 2008 as summarized in the following table in thousands 

 

 the increase in revenues was primarily related to higher minimum rent from i growth in rental rates from the renewal of expiring leases or releasing vacant space in the operating properties ii minimum rent generated from shopping center acquisitions in 2007 and iii recently completed shopping center developments commencing operations in the current year recoveries increased as a result of an increase in our operating expenses the increase in management transaction and other fees is primarily related to the recognition of a 197 million portfolio incentive return fee in december 2008 the fee was earned based upon columbia outperforming the ncreif index since the inception of the partnership and a hurdle rate outlined in the partnership agreement 

fees earned for asset management disposition property management leasing acquisition and financing services from our coinvestment partnerships and third parties are summarized as follows in thousands 

  

 the increase in transaction fees of 201 million is related to the 197 million portfolio incentive return fee discussed above asset and property management fees increased during 2008 as a result of providing those management services to mcwrdesco for the entire year during 2008 as compared to only a portion of 2007 when mcwrdesco was formed 

our operating expenses increased by 298 million or 120 to 2777 million in 2008 as summarized in the following table in thousands 

 

 the increase in operating maintenance and real estate taxes was primarily due to new properties acquired during 2007 operating for the entire year during 2008 recently completed developments commencing operations during 2007 and to general increases in expenses incurred by the operating properties on average approximately 79 of these costs are recovered from our tenants through recoveries included in our revenues general and administrative expense declined as a result of reducing incentive compensation directly tied to performance targets associated with reductions in new development and reduced earning metrics both of which were directly impacted by the economic downturn during 2008 during 2008 we also recorded restructuring charges of 24 million for employee severance and benefits related to employee reductions in force the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily related to acquisitions in 2007 operating for a full year in 2008 and recently completed developments commencing operations in the current year the increase in other expenses is related to expensing more predevelopment costs in 2008 than in 2007 directly related to a slowing development program due to the current economic environment 

the following table presents the change in interest expense from 2008 to 2007 in thousands 

 

 interest on unsecured credit facilities increased during 2008 by 25 million due to the increase in the outstanding balance under the unsecured credit facilities interest expense on notes payable increased during 2008 by 106 million due to higher outstanding debt balances including the issuance of 4000 million of unsecured debt in september 2007 the acquisition of shopping centers in 2007 and the mortgage debt placed on a consolidated joint venture in 2008 the higher development project costs also 

  

resulted in an increase in capitalized interest 

gains on sale of real estate included in continuing operations were 203 million in 2008 as compared to 522 million in 2007 included in 2008 gains are a 53 million gain from the sale of 12 outparcels for net proceeds of 382 million a 12 million gain recognized on two outparcels originally deferred at the time of sale and a 138 million gain net of the greater of our ownership interest or the gain deferral under the restricted gain method described in our critical accounting policies from the sale of four properties in development to joint ventures for net proceeds of 1105 million included in 2007 gains are a 72 million gain from the sale of 27 outparcels for net proceeds of 559 million a 409 million gain from the sale of five properties in development to the fund for net proceeds of 1028 million a 22 million gain related to the partial sale of our interest in the fund and a 19 million gain from our share of a contractual earn out payment related to a property previously sold to a joint venture there were no property sales to dikjv’s in 2007 

during 2008 we established a provision for impairment of approximately 349 million 34 million of which was reclassed to discontinued operations when the property was sold in 2009 included in the provision is 278 million for estimated impairment losses on eight operating properties one large parcel of land held for future development along with several smaller land outparcels 60 million on two of our investments in real estate partnerships and 11 million related to a note receivable 

our equity in income loss of investments in real estate partnerships decreased by 128 million during 2008 as follows in thousands 

 

 the decrease in our equity in income loss of investments in real estate partnerships is primarily related to higher gains recorded in 2007 from the sale of shopping centers sold by mcwr i as well as the sale of a shopping center owned by a joint venture classified above in other investments in real estate partnerships 

income from discontinued operations was 220 million for the year ended december 31 2008 related to the sale of seven properties in development and three operating properties sold to unrelated parties for net proceeds of 862 million including the operations of shopping centers sold or classified as heldforsale in 2008 income from discontinued operations was 340 million for the year ended december 31 2007 related to the sale of four properties in development and three operating properties to unrelated parties for net proceeds of 1123 million and including the operations of shopping centers sold or classified as heldforsale in 2008 and 2007 in compliance with statement 144 if we sell a property or classify a property as heldforsale we are required to reclassify its operations into discontinued operations for all prior periods which results in a reclassification of amounts previously reported as continuing operations into discontinued operations our income from discontinued operations is shown net of income taxes of 20 million for the year ended december 31 2007 

  

related to our parent company’s results net income attributable to common stockholders for the year ended decreased 675 million to 1165 million in 2008 as compared with 1840 million in 2007 primarily related to lower gains recognized from the sale of real estate and the provision for impairment recorded in 2008 as discussed previously diluted earnings per share was 166 in 2008 as compared to 265 in 2007 

related to our operating partnership’s results net income attributable to common unit holders for the year ended decreased 682 million to 1174 million in 2008 as compared with 1856 million in 2007 for the reasons stated above diluted earnings per unit was 166 in 2008 as compared to 265 in 2007 

environmental matters 

we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers and underground petroleum storage tanks we believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations generally we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to nonchlorinated solvent systems where available we have applied and been accepted into statesponsored environmental programs we have a blanket environmental insurance policy that covers us against thirdparty liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination we have also placed environmental insurance where possible on specific properties with known contamination in order to mitigate our environmental risk we monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites we also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so we estimate the cost associated with these legal obligations to be approximately 32 million all of which has been reserved we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position liquidity or operations however we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities that any previous owner occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants by the condition of nearby properties or by unrelated third parties or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us 

inflationdeflation 

inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers however more recent data suggests inflation will eventually become a greater concern as the economy begins to recover from the recent recession substantially all of our longterm leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation such provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rent based on tenants’ gross sales which generally increase as prices rise andor escalation clauses which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices in addition many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years which permits us to seek increased rents upon rerental at market rates most of our leases require tenants to pay their prorata share of operating expenses including commonarea maintenance real estate taxes insurance and utilities thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation however during deflationary periods or periods of economic weakness minimum rents and percentage rents will decline as the supply of available retail space exceeds demand and consumer spending declines occupancy declines resulting from a weak economic period will also likely result in lower recovery rates of our operating expenses

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk 

we are exposed to two significant components of interest rate risk our line commitment has a variable interest rate that is based upon libor plus a spread of 55 basis points and our revolving credit facility has a variable interest rate based upon libor plus a spread of 100 basis points libor rates charged on our unsecured credit facilities change monthly the spread on the unsecured credit facilities is dependent upon maintaining specific credit ratings if our credit ratings are downgraded the spread on the unsecured credit facilities would increase resulting in higher interest costs we are also exposed to higher interest rates when we refinance our existing longterm fixed rate debt the objective of our interest rate risk management is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we borrow primarily at fixed interest rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps caps or treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 

we have 3752 million of fixed rate debt maturing in 2010 and 2011 that has a weighted average fixed interest rate of 795 which includes 3340 million of unsecured longterm debt during 2006 we entered into four forwardstarting interest rate swaps the “swaps” totaling 3967 million with fixed rates of 5399 5415 5399 and 5415 we designated these swaps as cash flow hedges to lock in the underlying treasury rates on 3340 million of the financing expected to occur in 2010 and 2011 as a result of a decline in 10 year treasury interest rates since the inception of the swaps the fair value of the swaps as of december 31 2009 is reflected as a liability of 284 million in accompanying consolidated balance sheet it remains highly probable that the forecasted transactions will occur as projected at the inception of the swaps and therefore the change in fair value of the swaps is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the accompanying consolidated financial statements if we were to no longer expect to issue debt as originally forecasted we would be required to immediately expense the change in fair value of the swaps to net income including all future changes until settled during the year ended december 31 2009 we had 33 million of hedge ineffectiveness recognized in earnings attributable to our revised assumptions of future debt issues to the extent that future 10year treasury rates at the future settlement dates are higher than current rates this liability will decline if a liability exists at the dates the swaps are settled the liability will be amortized over the term of the respective debt issuances as additional interest expense in addition to the stated interest rates on the new debt on april 16 2009 we paid 200 million to settle and partially settle 1060 million of our 3967 million of interest rate swaps in place to hedge forecasted debt on july 1 2009 we closed on mortgage loans of 1060 million secured by eight properties with an interest rate of 775 and a 10year term for 907 million of the remaining swaps we continue to expect to issue new secured or unsecured debt for a term of 7 to 12 years prior to july 1 2010 for 2000 million of the remaining swaps we continue to expect to issue new debt for a term of 7 to 12 years during the period between march 31 2010 and march 31 2011 we continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt to repay maturing debt or fund our commitments based upon the current capital markets our current credit ratings and the number of high quality unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings we expect that we will be able to successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund our obligations an increase of 10 in the interest rate of new debt issued above that of maturing debt would result in additional annual interest expense of 33 million subject to the impact of the annual amortization that would be incurred as a result of settling the swaps 

our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the table below presents the principal cash flows in thousands weighted average interest rates of remaining debt and the fair value of total debt in thousands as of december 31 2009 by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes although the average interest rate for variable rate debt is included in the table those rates represent rates that existed at december 31 2009 and are subject to change on a monthly basis 

  

the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2009 and does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date since firm commitments are not presented the table has limited predictive value as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at that time and actual interest rates 

 

  

 the fair value of total debt in the table above is 14 billion versus the face value of 19 billion which suggests that as new debt is issued in the future to repay maturing debt the cost of new debt issuances will be higher than the current cost of existing debt

 item 1 business 

regency is a qualified real estate investment trust “reit” which began operations in 1993 our primary operating and investment goal is longterm growth in earnings per share and total shareholder return which we work to achieve by focusing on a strategy of owning operating and developing highquality community and neighborhood shopping centers that are tenanted by marketdominant grocers categoryleading anchors specialty retailers and restaurants located in areas with above average household incomes and population densities all of our operating investing and financing activities are performed through our operating partnership regency centers lp “rclp” rclp’s wholly owned subsidiaries and through its investments in coinvestment partnerships with third party investors regency currently owns 99 of the outstanding operating partnership units of rclp 

at december 31 2007 we directly owned 232 shopping centers the “consolidated properties” located in 23 states representing 257 million square feet of gross leasable area “gla” our cost of these shopping centers is 40 billion before depreciation through coinvestment partnerships we own partial interests in 219 shopping centers the “unconsolidated properties” located in 27 states and the district of columbia representing 254 million square feet of gla our investment in the partnerships that own the unconsolidated properties is 4329 million certain portfolio information described below is presented a on a combined basis which is a total of the consolidated properties and the unconsolidated properties b for our consolidated properties only and c for the unconsolidated properties that we own through coinvestment partnerships we believe that presenting the information under these methods provides a more complete understanding of the properties that we whollyown versus those that we partiallyown but for which we provide asset management property management leasing investing and financing services the shopping center portfolio that we manage on a combined basis represents 451 shopping centers located in 29 states and the district of columbia and contains 511 million square feet of gla 

we earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to marketleading grocers major retail anchors specialty sideshop retailers and restaurants including ground leasing or selling building pads outparcels to these tenants we experience growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates at currently owned shopping centers and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers community and neighborhood shopping centers generate substantial daily traffic by conveniently offering necessities and services this high traffic generates increased sales thereby driving higher occupancy and rentalrate growth which we expect will sustain our growth in earnings per share and increase the value of our portfolio over the long term 

  

index to financial statements we seek a range of strong national regional and local specialty retailers for the same reason that we choose to anchor our centers with leading grocers and major retailers who provide a mix of goods and services that meet consumer needs we have created a formal partnering process—the premier customer initiative “pci”—to promote mutually beneficial relationships with our specialty retailers the objective of pci is for regency to build a base of specialty tenants who represent the “bestinclass” operators in their respective merchandising categories such retailers reinforce the consumer appeal and other strengths of a center’s anchor help to stabilize a center’s occupancy reduce releasing downtime reduce tenant turnover and yield higher sustainable rents 

we grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions of operating centers and new shopping center development where we acquire the land and construct the building development is customer driven meaning we generally have an executed lease from the anchor before we start construction developments serve the growth needs of our anchors and specialty retailers resulting in modern shopping centers with longterm anchor leases that produce attractive returns on our invested capital this development process generally requires three to four years from initial land or redevelopment acquisition through construction leaseup and stabilization of rental income but can take longer depending upon the size of the project generally anchor tenants begin operating their stores prior to the completion of construction of the entire center resulting in rental income during the development phase 

we intend to maintain a conservative capital structure to fund our growth programs which should preserve our investmentgrade ratings our approach is founded on our selffunding business model this model utilizes center “recycling” as a key component which requires ongoing monitoring of each center to ensure that it continues to meet our investment standards we sell the operating properties that no longer measure up to our standards we also develop certain retail centers because of their attractive profit margins with the intent of selling them to coinvestment partnerships or other third parties upon completion these sale proceeds are redeployed into new higherquality developments and acquisitions that are expected to generate sustainable revenue growth and more attractive returns 

joint venturing of shopping centers also provides us with a capital source for new developments and acquisitions as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset and property management services as asset manager we are engaged by our partners to apply similar operating investment and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the coinvestment partnerships coinvestment partnerships grow their shopping center investments through acquisitions from third parties or direct purchases from regency although selling properties to coinvestment partnerships reduces our ownership interest we continue to share in the risks and rewards of centers that meet our high quality standards and longterm investment strategy 

competition 

we are among the largest publiclyheld owners of shopping centers in the nation based on revenues number of properties gross leasable area and market capitalization there are numerous companies and private individuals engaged in the ownership development acquisition and operation of shopping centers which compete with us in our targeted markets this results in competition for attracting anchor tenants as well as the acquisition of existing shopping centers and new development sites we believe that the principal competitive factors in attracting tenants in our market areas are location demographics rental costs tenant mix property age and maintenance we believe that our competitive advantages include our locations within our market areas the design quality of our shopping centers the strong demographics surrounding our shopping centers our relationships with our anchor tenants and our sideshop and outparcel retailers our pci program which allows us to provide retailers with multiple locations our practice of maintaining and renovating our shopping centers and our ability to source and develop new shopping centers 

changes in policies 

our board of directors establishes the policies that govern our investment and operating strategies including among others development and acquisition of shopping centers tenant and market focus debt and equity financing policies quarterly distributions to stockholders and reit tax status the board of directors may amend these policies at any time without a vote of our stockholders 

  

index to financial statements employees 

our headquarters are located at one independent drive suite 114 jacksonville florida we presently maintain 21 market offices nationwide where we conduct management leasing construction and investment activities at december 31 2007 we had 568 employees and we believe that our relations with our employees are good 

compliance with governmental regulations 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate certain hazardous or toxic substances at our shopping centers these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances the cost of required remediation and the owners liability for remediation could exceed the value of the property andor the aggregate assets of the owner the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent the property or borrow using the property as collateral we have a number of properties that could require or are currently undergoing varying levels of environmental remediation environmental remediation is not currently expected to have a material financial effect on us due to reserves for remediation insurance programs designed to mitigate the cost of remediation and various stateregulated programs that shift the responsibility and cost to the state

 item 1a risk factors 

risk factors related to our industry and real estate investments 

our revenues and cash flow could be adversely affected by poor market conditions where properties are geographically concentrated 

regency’s performance depends on the economic conditions in markets in which our properties are concentrated during the year ended december 31 2007 our properties in california florida and texas accounted for 584 of our consolidated net operating income our revenues and cash available for distribution to stockholders could be adversely affected by this geographic concentration if market conditions in these areas such as an oversupply of retail space or a reduction in the demand for shopping centers become more competitive relative to other geographic areas 

loss of revenues from major tenants could reduce distributions to stockholders 

we derive significant revenues from anchor tenants such as kroger publix and safeway that occupy more than one center distributions to stockholders could be adversely affected by the loss of revenues in the event a major tenant 

 

  

  

  

  

 vacated anchor space including space owned by the anchor can reduce rental revenues generated by the shopping center because of the loss of the departed anchor tenant’s customer drawing power most anchors have the right to vacate and prevent retenanting by paying rent for the balance of the lease term if major tenants vacate a property then other tenants may be entitled to terminate their leases at the property 

downturns in the retailing industry likely will have a direct adverse impact on our revenues and cash flow 

our properties consist primarily of groceryanchored shopping centers our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space the market for retail space has been or could be adversely affected by any of the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

index to financial statements   

  

  

  

 to the extent that any of these conditions occur they are likely to impact market rents for retail space occupancy in the operating portfolios our ability to recycle capital and our cash available for distribution to stockholders 

unsuccessful development activities or a slowdown in development activities could reduce distributions to stockholders 

we actively pursue development activities as opportunities arise development activities require various government and other approvals for entitlements which can significantly delay the development process we may not recover our investment in development projects for which approvals are not received we incur other risks associated with development activities including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if developments are unsuccessful funding provided from contributions to coinvestment partnerships and sales to third parties may be materially reduced and our cash flow available for distribution to stockholders will be reduced our earnings and cash flow available for distribution to stockholders also may be reduced if we experience a significant slowdown in our development activities 

uninsured loss may adversely affect distributions to stockholders 

we carry comprehensive liability fire flood extended coverage rental loss and environmental insurance for our properties with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties we believe that the insurance carried on our properties is adequate in accordance with industry standards there are however some types of losses such as from hurricanes terrorism wars or earthquakes which may be uninsurable or the cost of insuring against such losses may not be economically justifiable if an uninsured loss occurs we could lose both the invested capital in and anticipated revenues from the property but we would still be obligated to repay any recourse mortgage debt on the property in that event our distributions to stockholders could be reduced 

we face competition from numerous sources 

the ownership of shopping centers is highly fragmented with less than 10 owned by real estate investment trusts we face competition from other real estate investment trusts as well as from numerous small owners in the acquisition ownership and leasing of shopping centers we compete to develop shopping centers with other real estate investment trusts engaged in development activities as well as with local regional and national real estate developers 

  

index to financial statements we compete in the acquisition of properties through proprietary research that identifies opportunities in markets with high barriers to entry and higherthanaverage population growth and household income we seek to maximize rents per square foot by 1 establishing relationships with supermarket chains that are first or second in their markets or other categoryleading anchors and 2 leasing nonanchor space in multiple centers to national or regional tenants we compete to develop properties by applying our proprietary research methods to identify development and leasing opportunities and by preleasing a significant portion of a center before beginning construction 

there can be no assurance however that other real estate owners or developers will not utilize similar research methods and target the same markets and anchor tenants that we target these entities may successfully control these markets and tenants to our exclusion if we cannot successfully compete in our targeted markets our cash flow and therefore distributions to stockholders may be adversely affected 

costs of environmental remediation could reduce our cash flow available for distribution to stockholders 

under various federal state and local laws an owner or manager of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on the property these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances the cost of any required remediation could exceed the value of the property andor the aggregate assets of the owner 

we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers and underground petroleum storage tanks ust’s the presence of or the failure to properly remediate hazardous or toxic substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent a contaminated property or to borrow using the property as collateral any of these developments could reduce cash flow and distributions to stockholders 

risk factors related to our coinvestment partnerships and acquisition structure 

we do not have voting control over our joint venture investments so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued 

we have invested as a coventurer in the acquisition or development of properties as of december 31 2007 our investments in real estate partnerships represented 104 of our total assets these investments involve risks not present in a whollyowned project we do not have voting control over the ventures the coventurer might 1 have interests or goals that are inconsistent with our interests or goals or 2 otherwise impede our objectives the coventurer also might become insolvent or bankrupt 

our coinvestment partnerships account for a significant portion of our revenues and net income in the form of management fees and are an important part of our growth strategy the termination of our coinvestment partnerships could adversely affect distributions to stockholders 

our management fee income has increased significantly as our participation in coinvestment partnerships has increased if coinvestment partnerships owning a significant number of properties were dissolved for any reason we would lose the asset management and property management fees from these coinvestment partnerships which could adversely affect our ability to recycle capital and fund developments and acquisitions and the amount of cash available for distribution to stockholders 

in addition termination of the coinvestment partnerships without replacing them with new coinvestment partnerships could adversely affect our growth strategy property sales to the coinvestment partnerships provide us with an important source of funding for additional developments and acquisitions without this source of capital our ability to recycle capital fund developments and acquisitions and to increase distributions to stockholders could be adversely affected 

  

index to financial statements our partnership structure may limit our flexibility to manage our assets 

we invest in retail shopping centers through regency centers lp the operating partnership in which we currently own 99 of the outstanding common partnership units from time to time we acquire properties through our operating partnership in exchange for limited partnership interests this acquisition structure may permit limited partners who contribute properties to us to defer some if not all of the income tax liability that they would incur if they sold the property for cash 

properties contributed to our operating partnership may have unrealized gain attributable to the difference between the fair market value and adjusted tax basis in the properties prior to contribution as a result our sale of these properties could cause adverse tax consequences to the limited partners who contributed them 

generally our operating partnership has no obligation to consider the tax consequences of its actions to any limited partner however our operating partnership may acquire properties in the future subject to material restrictions on refinancing or resale designed to minimize the adverse tax consequences to the limited partners who contribute those properties these restrictions could significantly reduce our flexibility to manage our assets by preventing us from reducing mortgage debt or selling a property when such a transaction might be in our best interest in order to reduce interest costs or dispose of an underperforming property 

risk factors related to our capital recycling and capital structure 

a reduction in the availability of capital an increase in the cost of capital and higher market capitalization rates could adversely impact regency’s ability to recycle capital and fund developments and acquisitions and could dilute earnings 

as part of our capital recycling program we sell operating properties that no longer meet our investment standards we also develop certain retail centers because of their attractive margins with the intent of selling them to coinvestment partnerships or other third parties for a profit these sale proceeds are used to fund the construction of new developments an increase in market capitalization rates could cause a reduction in the value of centers identified for sale which would have an adverse impact on our capital recycling program by reducing the amount of cash generated and profits realized in order to meet the cash requirements of our development program we may be required to sell more properties than initially planned which would have a dilutive impact on our earnings 

our debt financing may reduce distributions to stockholders 

we do not expect to generate sufficient funds from operations to make balloon principal payments when due on our debt if we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms we might be forced 1 to dispose of properties which might result in losses or 2 to obtain financing at unfavorable terms either could reduce the cash flow available for distributions to stockholders 

in addition if we cannot make required mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose on the property securing the mortgage causing the loss of cash flow from that property furthermore substantially all of our debt is crossdefaulted which means that a default under one loan could trigger defaults under other loans 

our organizational documents do not limit the amount of debt that may be incurred the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences including the following 

 

  

  

 covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition 

our revolving line of credit and our unsecured notes contain customary covenants including compliance with financial ratios such as ratios of total debt to gross asset value and fixed charge coverage ratios our line of credit also 

  

index to financial statements restricts our ability to enter into a transaction that would result in a change of control these covenants may limit our operational flexibility and our acquisition activities moreover if we breach any of these covenants the resulting default could cause the acceleration of our indebtedness even in the absence of a payment default if we are not able to refinance our indebtedness after a default or unable to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms distributions to stockholders and our financial condition would be adversely affected 

we depend on external sources of capital which may not be available in the future 

to qualify as a reit we must among other things distribute to our stockholders each year at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding any net capital gains because of these distribution requirements we likely will not be able to fund all future capital needs including capital for acquisitions or developments with income from operations we therefore will have to rely on thirdparty sources of capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all our access to thirdparty sources of capital depends on a number of things including the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings in addition our line of credit imposes covenants that limit our flexibility in obtaining other financing such as a prohibition on negative pledge agreements 

additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders’ interests and additional debt financing may substantially increase our degree of leverage 

risk factors related to interest rates and the market for our stock 

increased interest rates may reduce distributions to stockholders 

we are obligated on floating rate debt and if we do not eliminate our exposure to increases in interest rates through interest rate protection or cap agreements these increases may reduce cash flow and our ability to make distributions to stockholders 

although swap agreements enable us to convert floating rate debt to fixed rate debt and cap agreements enable us to cap our maximum interest rate they expose us to the risk that the counterparties to these hedge agreements may not perform which could increase our exposure to rising interest rates if we enter into swap agreements decreases in interest rates will increase our interest expense as compared to the underlying floating rate debt this could result in our making payments to unwind these agreements such as in connection with a prepayment of the floating rate debt cap agreements do not protect us from increases up to the capped rate 

increased market interest rates could reduce our stock prices 

the annual dividend rate on our common stock as a percentage of its market price may influence the trading price of our stock an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers to demand a higher annual dividend rate which could adversely affect the market price of our stock a decrease in the market price of our common stock could reduce our ability to raise additional equity in the public markets selling common stock at a decreased market price would have a dilutive impact on existing shareholders 

risk factors related to federal income tax laws 

if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 

we believe that we qualify for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes and we plan to operate so that we can continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit if we qualify as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on our income that we distribute currently to our stockholders many of the reit requirements however are highly technical and complex the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances some of which may not be totally within our control and some of which involve questions of interpretation for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income must come from specific passive 

  

index to financial statements sources like rent that are itemized in the reit tax laws there can be no assurance that the irs or a court would agree with the positions we have taken in interpreting the reit requirements we also are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains the fact that we hold many of our assets through coinvestment partnerships and their subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status furthermore congress and the internal revenue service might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult or impossible for us to remain qualified as a reit 

also unless the irs granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we would remain disqualified as a reit for four years following the year we first failed to qualify if we failed to qualify as a reit we would have to pay significant income taxes this would likely have a significant adverse affect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to pay any dividends to stockholders 

even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we are required to pay certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from “prohibited transactions” that income will be subject to a 100 tax in general prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business the determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale while we have undertaken a significant number of asset sales in recent years we do not believe that those sales should be considered prohibited transactions but there can be no assurance that the irs would not contend otherwise 

in addition any net taxable income earned directly by our taxable affiliates including regency realty group inc is subject to federal and state corporate income tax several provisions of the laws applicable to reits and their subsidiaries ensure that a taxable reit subsidiary will be subject to an appropriate level of federal income taxation for example a taxable reit subsidiary is limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to an affiliated reit in addition a reit has to pay a 100 penalty tax on some payments that it receives if the economic arrangements between the reit the reit’s tenants and the taxable reit subsidiary are not comparable to similar arrangements between unrelated parties finally some state and local jurisdictions may tax some of our income even though as a reit we are not subject to federal income tax on that income to the extent that we and our affiliates are required to pay federal state and local taxes we will have less cash available for distributions to our stockholders 

a reit may not own securities in any one issuer if the value of those securities exceeds 5 of the value of the reit’s total assets or the securities owned by the reit represent more than 10 of the issuer’s outstanding voting securities or 10 of the value of the issuer’s outstanding securities an exception to these tests allows a reit to own securities of a subsidiary that exceed the 5 value test and the 10 value tests if the subsidiary elects to be a “taxable reit subsidiary” we are not able to own securities of taxable reit subsidiaries that represent in the aggregate more than 20 of the value of our total assets we currently own more than 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of regency realty group inc which has elected to be a taxable reit subsidiary 

risk factors related to our ownership limitations the florida business corporation act and certain other matters 

restrictions on the ownership of our capital stock to preserve our reit status could delay or prevent a change in control 

ownership of more than 7 by value of our outstanding capital stock by certain persons is restricted for the purpose of maintaining our qualification as a reit with certain exceptions this 7 limitation may discourage a change in control and may also i deter tender offers for our capital stock which offers may be attractive to our stockholders or ii limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their capital stock that might otherwise exist if an investor attempted to assemble a block in excess of 7 of our outstanding capital stock or to effect a change in control 

the issuance of our capital stock could delay or prevent a change in control 

our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to 30000000 shares of preferred stock and 10000000 shares of special common stock and to establish the preferences and rights of any shares issued the 

  

index to financial statements issuance of preferred stock or special common stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control even if a change in control were in our stockholders’ interest the provisions of the florida business corporation act regarding control share acquisitions and affiliated transactions could also deter potential acquisitions by preventing the acquiring party from voting the common stock it acquires or consummating a merger or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of our disinterested stockholders

 we intend to pay regular quarterly distributions to our common stockholders future distributions will be declared and paid at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon cash generated by operating activities our financial condition capital requirements annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended and such other factors as our board of directors deem relevant distributions by us to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes will be taxable to stockholders as either ordinary dividend income or capital gain income if so declared by us distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will be treated as a nontaxable return of capital such distributions have the effect of deferring taxation until the sale of a stockholder’s common stock in order to maintain our qualification as a reit we must make annual distributions to stockholders of at least 90 of our taxable income under certain circumstances which we do not expect to occur we could be required to make distributions in excess of cash available for distributions in order to meet such requirements we currently maintain the regency centers corporation dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan which enables our stockholders to automatically reinvest distributions as well as make voluntary cash payments towards the purchase of additional shares 

under the loan agreement of our line of credit in the event of any monetary default we may not make distributions to stockholders except to the extent necessary to maintain our reit status 

we sold the following equity securities during the quarter ended december 31 2007 that we did not report on form 8k because they represent in the aggregate less than 1 of our outstanding common stock all shares were issued to one accredited investor an unrelated party in a transaction exempt from registration pursuant to section 42 of the securities act of 1933 in exchange for an equal number of common units of our operating partnership regency centers lp

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview and operating philosophy 

regency is a qualified real estate investment trust “reit” which began operations in 1993 our primary operating and investment goal is longterm growth in earnings per share and total shareholder return which we work to achieve by focusing on a strategy of owning operating and developing highquality community and neighborhood shopping centers that are tenanted by marketdominant grocers categoryleading anchors specialty retailers and restaurants located in areas with above average household incomes and population densities all of our operating investing and financing activities are performed through our operating partnership regency centers lp “rclp” rclp’s wholly owned subsidiaries and through its investments in coinvestment partnerships with third parties regency currently owns 99 of the outstanding operating partnership units of rclp 

  

index to financial statements at december 31 2007 we directly owned 232 shopping centers the “consolidated properties” located in 23 states representing 257 million square feet of gross leasable area “gla” our cost of these shopping centers is 40 billion before depreciation through coinvestment partnerships we own partial interests in 219 shopping centers the “unconsolidated properties” located in 27 states and the district of columbia representing 254 million square feet of gla our investment in the partnerships that own the unconsolidated properties is 4329 million certain portfolio information described below is presented a on a combined basis which is a total of the consolidated properties and the unconsolidated properties b for our consolidated properties only and c for the unconsolidated properties that we own through coinvestment partnerships we believe that presenting the information under these methods provides a more complete understanding of the properties that we whollyown versus those that we partiallyown but for which we provide asset management property management leasing investing and financing services the shopping center portfolio that we manage on a combined basis represents 451 shopping centers located in 29 states and the district of columbia and contains 511 million square feet of gla 

we earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to marketleading grocers major retail anchors specialty sideshop retailers and restaurants including ground leasing or selling building pads outparcels to these potential tenants we experience growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates at currently owned shopping centers and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers community and neighborhood shopping centers generate substantial daily traffic by conveniently offering daily necessities and services this high traffic generates increased sales thereby driving higher occupancy and rentalrate growth which we expect will sustain our growth in earnings per share and increase the value of our portfolio over the long term 

we seek a range of strong national regional and local specialty retailers for the same reason that we choose to anchor our centers with leading grocers and major retailers who provide a mix of goods and services that meet consumer needs we have created a formal partnering process—the premier customer initiative “pci”—to promote mutually beneficial relationships with our specialty retailers the objective of pci is for regency to build a base of specialty tenants who represent the “bestinclass” operators in their respective merchandising categories such retailers reinforce the consumer appeal and other strengths of a center’s anchor help to stabilize a center’s occupancy reduce releasing downtime reduce tenant turnover and yield higher sustainable rents 

we grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions of operating centers and new shopping center development where we acquire the land and construct the building development is customer driven meaning we generally have an executed lease from the anchor before we start construction developments serve the growth needs of our anchors and specialty retailers resulting in modern shopping centers with longterm anchor leases that produce attractive returns on our invested capital this development process generally requires three to four years from initial land or redevelopment acquisition through construction leaseup and stabilization of rental income but can take longer depending upon the size of the project generally anchor tenants begin operating their stores prior to the completion of construction of the entire center resulting in rental income during the development phase 

we intend to maintain a conservative capital structure to fund our growth program which should preserve our investmentgrade ratings our approach is founded on our selffunding business model this model utilizes center “recycling” as a key component which requires ongoing monitoring of each center to ensure that it continues to meet our investment standards we sell the operating properties that no longer measure up to our standards we also develop certain retail centers because of their attractive profit margins with the intent of selling them to coinvestment partnerships or other third parties upon completion these sale proceeds are redeployed into new higherquality developments and acquisitions that are expected to generate sustainable revenue growth and more attractive returns 

joint venturing of shopping centers also provides us with a capital source for new developments and acquisitions as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset and property management services as asset manager we are engaged by our partners to apply similar operating investment and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the coinvestment partnerships coinvestment partnerships grow their shopping center investments through acquisitions from third parties or direct purchases from regency although selling properties to coinvestment partnerships reduces our ownership interest we continue to share in the risks and rewards of centers that meet our high quality standards and longterm investment strategy we currently have no obligations or liabilities of the coinvestment partnerships beyond our economic ownership interest 

  

index to financial statements we have identified certain significant risks and challenges affecting our industry and we are addressing them accordingly the current economic downturn could result in a decline in occupancy levels at our shopping centers which would reduce our rental revenues we believe that our investment focus on neighborhood and community shopping centers that conveniently provide daily necessities should minimize the current economy’s negative impact to our shopping centers although we may incur slower income growth and potentially no growth depending upon the severity of the economic downturn increased competition and the slowing economy could result in higher than usual retailer store closings we are closely monitoring the operating performance and tenants’ sales in our shopping centers including those tenants operating retail formats that are experiencing significant changes in competition or business practice we also continue to monitor retail trends and market our shopping centers based on consumer demand in the current environment retailers are reducing their demand for new stores a significant slowdown in retailer new store demand could cause a corresponding reduction in our shopping center development program that would reduce our future rental revenues and profits from development sales a significant reduction in our development program including future developments being pursued could reduce our net income as a result of i potentially higher writeoffs of predevelopment costs on new development pursuits ii lower capitalized interest from not converting land currently owned and held for future development into an active development or stopping development of a current project and iii reduced capitalized employee costs see critical accounting policies and estimates—capitalization of costs described further below based upon our current pipeline of development projects undergoing due diligence which is our best indication of retailer expansion plans the presence of our development teams in key markets in combination with their excellent relationships with leading anchor tenants we remain cautiously optimistic about our development program however if economic growth stalls our volume of new development activity may be less than that of historical levels until the economy returns to its historical levels of growth 

shopping center portfolio 

the following tables summarize general operating statistics related to our shopping center portfolio which we use to evaluate and monitor our performance 

 

 we seek to reduce our operating and leasing risks through diversification which we achieve by geographically diversifying our shopping centers avoiding dependence on any single property market or tenant and owning a portion of our shopping centers through coinvestment partnerships 

  

index to financial statements the following summarizes the four largest grocery tenants occupying our shopping centers at december 31 2007 

 

  

  although base rent is supported by longterm lease contracts tenants who file bankruptcy are given the right to cancel any or all of their leases and close related stores or to continue to operate in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues we continually monitor industry trends and sales data to help us identify declines in retail categories or tenants who might be experiencing financial difficulties especially in light of the current downturn in the economy we continue to monitor the video rental industry while its operators transition to different rental formats including online rental programs at december 31 2007 we had leases with 123 video rental stores representing 89 million of annual rental income to the consolidated properties and our prorata share of the unconsolidated properties 

in october 2007 movie gallery filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection movie gallery has closed six stores and has served notice of five additional store closings the annual base rent on a prorata basis is approximately 860000 or 24 associated with these eleven stores subsequent to these closings we expect that movie gallery will continue to operate 21 stores with annual base rent on a prorata basis of approximately 950000 or 26 

we are not aware at this time of the current or pending bankruptcy of any other tenants that would cause a significant reduction in our revenues and no tenant represents more than 6 of the total of our annual base rental revenues and our prorata share of the base revenues of the unconsolidated properties 

liquidity and capital resources 

we expect that cash generated from operating activities combined with gains on the sale of development properties will provide the necessary funds to pay our operating expenses interest expense scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness capital expenditures necessary to maintain and improve our shopping centers and dividends to stockholders net cash provided by operating activities was 2243 million 2168 million and 2054 million and gains from the sale of real estate were 796 million 1248 million and 767 million for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively during 2007 2006 and 2005 we incurred capital expenditures to improve our shopping centers of 151 million 140 million and 144 million we paid scheduled principal payments of 45 million 45 million and 55 million to our lenders on mortgage loans and we paid dividends to our stockholders and unit holders of 2043 million 1852 million and 1674 million respectively the increase in dividends during 2007 relates to a 109 increase in our annual dividend per common share 

we intend to continue to grow our portfolio by investing in shopping centers through ground up development of new centers or acquisition of existing centers because development and acquisition activities are discretionary in nature they are not expected to burden the capital resources we have currently available for liquidity requirements however our development program continues to be a significant part of our business model and we expect to continue to start new development projects each year based upon retailer store demand capital availability and adequate investment returns we expect to meet our longterm capital investment requirements for development acquisitions and maturing secured mortgage loans primarily from i residual cash generated from operating activities after the payments described above ii draws on our line of credit and iii proceeds from the sale or joint venturing of real estate we would expect that maturing unsecured public debt would be repaid from the proceeds of similar new issues 

  

index to financial statements in the future although we have no maturing public debt in 2008 we do have 50 million and 160 million maturing in 2009 and 2010 respectively although common or preferred equity raised in the public markets is a funding option and we consider our access to these markets to be good we do not currently anticipate issuing equity to fund our development program or repay maturing debt we would consider issuing equity as part of a financing plan to maintain our leverage ratios at acceptable levels as determined by our board of directors at december 31 2007 we had an unlimited amount available under our shelf registration for equity securities and rclp had 200 million available for debt under its shelf registration 

the following table summarizes net cash flows related to operating investing and financing activities in thousands 

 

 at december 31 2007 we had 49 properties under construction or undergoing major renovations on a combined basis which when completed will represent a net investment of 11 billion after projected sales of adjacent land and outparcels this compares to 47 properties that were under construction at the end of 2006 representing an investment of 11 billion upon completion we estimate that we will earn an average return on our investment from our current development projects of 839 on a fully allocated basis including direct internal costs and the cost to acquire any residual interests held by minority development partners average returns have declined over previous years primarily the result of higher costs associated with the acquisition of land and construction we believe that our development returns are sufficient on a risk adjusted basis costs necessary to complete the current development projects net of projected land sales are estimated to be 4474 million and will likely be expended through 2011 the costs to complete these developments will be funded from our 6000 million line of credit which had 3920 million of available funding at december 31 2007 and from expected proceeds from the future sale of shopping centers as part of the capital recycling program described above 

during 2007 we acquired five shopping centers for a purchase price of 1060 million which included the assumption of 423 million in debt net of a 12 million discount in accordance with statement 141 acquired lease intangible assets and acquired lease intangible liabilities of 93 million and 47 million respectively were recorded for these acquisitions the acquisitions were accounted for as a purchase business combination and the results of their operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition

index to financial statements recognition of gains from sales to coinvestment partnerships is recorded on only that portion of the sales not attributable to our ownership interest the gains and operations are not recorded as discontinued operations because of our continuing involvement in these shopping centers columbia regcal the coinvestment partnerships with mcw and the fund intend to continue to acquire retail shopping centers some of which they may acquire directly from us for those properties acquired from unrelated parties we are required to contribute our prorata share of the purchase price to the partnerships 

contractual obligations 

we have debt obligations related to our mortgage loans unsecured notes and our unsecured line of credit as described further below we have shopping centers that are subject to noncancelable longterm ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to us to construct andor operate a shopping center in addition we have noncancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from which we conduct our business the table excludes obligations for approximately 34 million related to environmental remediation as discussed below under environmental matters as the timing of the remediation is not currently known the table also excludes obligations related to construction or development contracts because payments are only due upon the satisfactory performance under the contract costs necessary to complete the 49 development projects currently in process are estimated to be 4474 million and will likely be expended through 2011 the following table summarizes our debt maturities including interest excluding recorded debt premiums that are not obligations and obligations under noncancelable operating leases as of december 31 2007 including our prorata share of obligations within unconsolidated coinvestment partnerships in thousands 

 

  

 notes payable 

outstanding debt at december 31 2007 and 2006 consists of the following in thousands 

 

   

index to financial statements mortgage loans are secured and may be prepaid but could be subject to yield maintenance premiums mortgage loans are generally due in monthly installments of principal and interest and mature over various terms through 2018 we intend to repay mortgage loans at maturity from proceeds from our unsecured line of credit the “line” fixed interest rates on mortgage loans range from 522 to 895 and average 637 we have one variable rate mortgage loan with an interest rate equal to libor plus a spread of 100 basis points 

on june 5 2007 rclp completed the sale of 4000 million of tenyear senior unsecured notes the 5875 notes are due june 15 2017 and were priced at 99527 to yield 5938 the net proceeds were used to reduce the line 

in february 2007 we entered into a new loan agreement under the line which increased the commitment to 6000 million with the right to increase the facility size an additional 1500 million subject to additional lender syndication the line has a fouryear term which expires in 2011 with a oneyear extension at our option and the interest rate was reduced to libor plus 55 contractual interest rates were 5425 at december 31 2007 and 6125 at december 31 2006 based on libor plus 55 and 75 respectively the balance on the line was 2080 million at december 31 2007 

the spread on the line is dependent upon maintaining specific investmentgrade ratings we are also required to comply and are in compliance with certain financial covenants such as minimum net worth total liabilities to gross asset value “gav” recourse secured debt to gav fixed charge coverage and other covenants customary with this type of unsecured financing the line is used primarily to finance the development and acquisition of real estate but is also available for general workingcapital purposes on december 5 2007 standard and poor’s rating services raised regency’s corporate credit and senior unsecured ratings to bbb from bbb as a result of this upgrade the interest rate on the line was reduced to libor plus 40 effective january 1 2008 

as of december 31 2007 scheduled principal repayments on notes payable and the line were as follows in thousands 

 

 our investments in real estate partnerships had notes and mortgage loans payable of 27 billion at december 31 2007 which mature through 2028 our prorata share of these loans was 6533 million of which 936 had weighted average fixed interest rates of 53 and the remaining had variable interest rates based on libor plus a spread in a range of 50 to 100 basis points the loans are primarily nonrecourse but for those that are guaranteed by a joint venture our liability does not extend beyond our economic interest in the joint venture 

we are exposed to capital market risk such as changes in interest rates in order to manage the volatility related to interestrate risk we originate new debt with fixed interest rates or we may enter into interestrate hedging arrangements we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes we engage outside experts who evaluate and make recommendations about hedging strategies when appropriate we account for derivative instruments under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended “statement 133” on march 10 2006 we entered into four forwardstarting interest rate swaps totaling 3967 million with fixed rates of 5399 5415 5399 and 5415 we 

  

index to financial statements designated these swaps as cash flow hedges to fix the rate on 4000 million of new financing expected to occur in 2010 and 2011 and these proceeds will be used to repay maturing debt at that time the change in fair value of these swaps from inception was a liability of 98 million at december 31 2007 and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income loss 

at december 31 2007 894 of our total debt had fixed interest rates compared with 880 at december 31 2006 we intend to limit the percentage of variable interestrate debt to be no more than 30 of total debt which we believe to be an acceptable risk currently our variable rate debt represents 107 of our total debt based upon the variable interestrate debt outstanding at december 31 2007 if variable interest rates were to increase by 1 our annual interest expense would increase by 21 million 

on february 26 2008 we were notified by wells fargo bank that they had received commitments from a group of banks which in combination with their commitment will provide us with an estimated 3415 million threeyear term loan facility the “term facility” the term facility will include a term loan amount of 2277 million that will fund at closing plus a 1138 million revolver component that is accessible by us at our discretion the term facility will be subject to similar loan covenants that are contained within the line and our other unsecured fixed rate loans the term loan has a variable interest rate equal to libor plus 105 basis points and the revolver has a variable interest rate equal to libor plus 110 basis points both of which are subject to our current debt ratings the term facility does not affect the company’s existing 6000 million line commitment the proceeds from the funding of the term facility will be used for general working capital purposes including the reduction of any debt balances at our discretion the term facility is expected to close during march 2008 subject to final terms and conditions 

equity transactions 

from time to time we issue equity in the form of exchangeable operating partnership units or preferred units of rclp or in the form of common or preferred stock of regency centers corporation as previously discussed these sources of longterm equity financing allow us to fund our growth while maintaining a conservative capital structure 

preferred units 

we have issued preferred units in various amounts since 1998 the net proceeds of which were used to reduce the balance of the line we issue preferred units primarily to institutional investors in private placements generally the preferred units may be exchanged by the holders for cumulative redeemable preferred stock after a specified date at an exchange rate of one share for one unit the preferred units and the related preferred stock are not convertible into regency common stock at december 31 2007 and 2006 only the series d preferred units were outstanding with a face value of 500 million and a fixed distribution rate of 745 these units may be called by us in 2009 and have no stated maturity or mandatory redemption included in the series d preferred units are original issuance costs of 842023 that will be expensed if they are redeemed in the future 

preferred stock 

as of december 31 2007 we had three series of preferred stock outstanding two of which underlie depositary shares held by the public the depositary shares each represent 110 th of a share of the underlying preferred stock and have a liquidation preference of 25 per depository share in 2003 we issued 745 series 3 cumulative redeemable preferred stock underlying three million depositary shares in 2004 we issued 725 series 4 cumulative redeemable preferred stock underlying five million depositary shares in 2005 we issued three million shares or 750 million of 670 series 5 preferred stock with a liquidation preference of 25 per share all series of preferred stock are perpetual are not convertible into common stock of the company and are redeemable at par upon our election beginning five years after the issuance date the terms of the preferred stock do not contain any unconditional obligations that would require us to redeem the securities at any time or for any purpose 

on january 1 2008 the company split each share of existing series 3 and series 4 preferred stock each having a liquidation preference of 250 per share and a redemption price of 250 per share into ten shares of series 3 and series 4 stock respectively each having a liquidation preference of 25 per share and a redemption price of 25 per 

  

index to financial statements share the company then exchanged each series 3 and 4 depository share into shares of new series 3 and 4 stock respectively which have the same dividend rights and other rights and preferences identical to the depositary shares 

common stock 

on april 5 2005 we entered into an agreement to sell 4312500 shares of common stock to an affiliate of citigroup global markets inc “citigroup” at 4660 per share in connection with a forward sale agreement the “forward sale agreement” on august 1 2005 we issued 3782500 shares to citigroup for net proceeds of approximately 1755 million and on september 7 2005 the remaining 530000 shares were issued for net proceeds of 244 million the proceeds from the sales were used to reduce the line and redeem the series e and f preferred units 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial results and discussion and analysis of these results the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities at a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period these accounting estimates are based upon but not limited to our judgments about historical results current economic activity and industry accounting standards they are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness however the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates 

revenue recognition and tenant receivables—tenant receivables represent revenues recognized in our financial statements and include base rent percentage rent and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs insurance and real estate taxes we analyze tenant receivables historical bad debt levels customer creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts in addition we analyze the accounts of tenants in bankruptcy and we estimate the recovery of prepetition and postpetition claims our reported net income is directly affected by our estimate of the recoverability of tenant receivables 

recognition of gains from the sales of real estate—we account for profit recognition on sales of real estate in accordance with sfas statement no 66 “accounting for sales of real estate” profits from sales of real estate will not be recognized under the full accrual method by us unless i a sale has been consummated ii the buyer’s initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property iii we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership and iv we do not have significant continuing involvement with the property recognition of gains from sales to coinvestment partnerships is recorded on only that portion of the sales not attributable to our ownership interest 

capitalization of costs—we capitalize the acquisition of land the construction of buildings and other specifically identifiable development costs incurred by recording them into “properties in development” on our consolidated balance sheets and account for them in accordance with sfas no 67 “accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects” sfas 67 and eitf issue no 9711 “accounting for internal costs relating to real estate property acquisitions” in summary sfas 67 establishes that a rental project changes from nonoperating to operating when it is substantially completed and held available for occupancy at that time costs should no longer be capitalized other development costs include predevelopment costs essential to the development of the property as well as interest real estate taxes and direct employee costs incurred during the development period predevelopment costs are incurred prior to land acquisition during the due diligence phase and include contract deposits legal engineering and other professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center if we determine that the development of a specific project undergoing due diligence was no longer probable we would immediately expense all related capitalized predevelopment costs not considered recoverable at december 31 2007 we had 227 million of capitalized predevelopment costs and during 2007 we expensed 53 million related to developments that were no longer considered probable interest costs are capitalized into each development project 

  

index to financial statements based on applying our weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the actual development costs expended we generally cease interest cost capitalization when the property is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements but in no event would we capitalize interest on the project beyond 12 months after substantial completion of the building shell during 2007 we capitalized interest on our development projects of 354 million we have a large staff of employees who support the due diligence land acquisition construction anchor leasing and financial analysis the “investment group” of our development program all direct internal costs related to these development activities are capitalized as part of each development project during 2007 we capitalized 390 million of direct costs incurred by the investment group if future accounting standards were to limit the amount of internal costs that may be capitalized or if our development activity were to decline significantly without a proportionate decrease in internal costs we could incur a significant increase in our operating expenses and a reduction in net income 

real estate acquisitions—upon acquisition of operating real estate properties we estimate the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land building and improvements and identified intangible assets liabilities consisting of above and belowmarket leases inplace leases and tenant relationships and assumed debt in accordance with sfas no 141 “business combinations” “statement 141” based on these estimates we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets acquired and liabilities assumed we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities we evaluate the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets each reporting period and account for any changes in estimated useful lives over the revised remaining useful life 

valuation of real estate investments—our longlived assets primarily real estate held for investment are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted the review involves a number of assumptions and estimates used to determine whether impairment exists depending on the asset we use varying methods to determine fair value of the asset such as i estimating discounted future cash flows ii determining resale values by market or iii applying a capitalization rate to net operating income using prevailing rates in a given market these methods of determining fair value can fluctuate significantly as a result of a number of factors including changes in the general economy of those markets in which we operate tenant credit quality and demand for new retail stores capitalization rates may change and could rise above existing levels causing our real estate values to decline if we determine that the carrying amount of a property is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value we will write down the asset to fair value for “heldandused” assets and to fair value less costs to sell for “heldforsale” assets 

discontinued operations—the application of current accounting principles that govern the classification of any of our properties as heldforsale on the balance sheet or the presentation of results of operations and gains on the sale of these properties as discontinued requires management to make certain significant judgments in evaluating whether a property meets the criteria set forth by sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment and disposal of longlived assets” “statement 144” we make a determination as to the point in time that it is probable that a sale will be consummated given the nature of all real estate sales contracts it is not unusual for such contracts to allow potential buyers a period of time to evaluate the property prior to formal acceptance of the contract in addition certain other matters critical to the final sale such as financing arrangements often remain pending even upon contract acceptance as a result properties under contract may not close within the expected time period or may not close at all due to these uncertainties it is not likely that we can meet the criteria of statement 144 prior to the sale formally closing therefore any properties categorized as heldforsale represent only those properties that management has determined are probable to close within the requirements set forth in statement 144 prior to sale we evaluate the extent of involvement and significance of cash flows it will have with a property subsequent to its sale in order to determine if the results of operations and gain on sale should be reflected as discontinued consistent with statement 144 any property sold in which we have significant continuing involvement or cash flows most often sales to coinvestment partnerships is not considered to be discontinued in addition any property which we sell to an unrelated third party but we retain a property or asset management function is not considered discontinued therefore based on our evaluation of statement 144 only properties sold or to be sold to unrelated third parties where we will have no significant continuing involvement or significant cash flows are classified as discontinued 

  

index to financial statements investments in real estate coinvestment partnerships—in addition to owning real estate directly we invest in real estate through our coinvestment partnerships also referred to as joint ventures joint venturing provides us with a capital source to acquire real estate and to earn our prorata share of the net income from the coinvestment partnerships in addition to fees for services as asset and property manager we conduct the business of the unconsolidated properties held in the coinvestment partnerships in the same way that we conduct the business of the consolidated properties that are whollyowned therefore the critical accounting policies as described are also applicable to our investments in the coinvestment partnerships we account for all investments in which we do not have a controlling financial interest using the equity method we have determined that these investments are not variable interest entities as defined in the fin 46r and do not require consolidation under eitf 045 or sop 789 and therefore are subject to the voting interest model in determining our basis of accounting major decisions including property acquisitions and dispositions financings annual budgets and dissolution of the ventures are subject to the approval of all partners or in the case of the fund its advisory committee 

income tax status—the prevailing assumption underlying the operation of our business is that we will continue to operate in order to qualify as a reit as defined under the internal revenue code we are required to meet certain income and asset tests on a periodic basis to ensure that we continue to qualify as a reit as a reit we are allowed to reduce taxable income by all or a portion of our distributions to stockholders we evaluate the transactions that we enter into and determine their impact on our reit status determining our taxable income calculating distributions and evaluating transactions requires us to make certain judgments and estimates as to the positions we take in our interpretation of the internal revenue code because many types of transactions are susceptible to varying interpretations under federal and state income tax laws and regulations our positions are subject to change at a later date upon final determination by the taxing authorities

we earn fees for asset management property management leasing acquisition and financing services that we provide to our coinvestment partnerships and third parties summarized as follows in thousands 

 

 property management fees increased in 2007 as a result of providing property management services to mcwrdesco and the fund asset management fees were higher in 2007 because the agreement to provide asset management services to mcwr ii did not commence until december 2006 and the closing and related commencement of the agreements with the fund did not occur until december 2006 acquisition and financing fees earned in 2007 include a 32 million acquisition fee from mcwrdesco related to the acquisition of 32 retail centers described above acquisition and financing fees earned in 2006 include fees earned as part of the acquisition of the first washington portfolio by mcwr ii

 the increase in operating maintenance and real estate taxes was primarily due to acquisitions and recently completed developments commencing operations in the current year and to general price increases incurred by the operating properties net of properties sold on average approximately 80 of these costs are recovered from our tenants through reimbursements included in our revenues 

the increase in general and administrative expense is related to annual salary increases and higher costs associated with incentive compensation in addition to increased staffing and recruiting costs to manage the growth in our shopping center development program 

the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily related to acquisitions and recently completed developments commencing operations in the current year net of properties sold 

the decrease in other expenses is related to lower income tax expense incurred by regency realty group inc “rrg” our taxable reit subsidiary rrg is subject to federal and state income taxes and files separate tax returns

 property management fees increased in 2006 as a result of managing the first washington portfolio acquisition for mcwr ii for an entire 12 months during 2006 as compared to seven months during 2005 this also resulted in higher leasing commissions earned during 2006 acquisition and financing fees were lower in 2006 due to a lower level of acquisition activity in 2006 as compared to 2005 fees earned in 2005 were primarily related to the acquisition of the first washington portfolio by mcwr ii during 2006 we earned additional fees from mcwr ii for achieving certain income performance results related to the first washington portfolio 

  

index to financial statements our operating expenses increased by 341 million or 17 to 2394 million in 2006 related to increased operating and maintenance costs general and administrative costs and depreciation expense as further described below the following table summarizes our operating expenses in thousands 

 

 the increase in operating maintenance and real estate taxes was primarily due to shopping center developments that were recently completed and did not incur operating expenses for a full 12 months during the previous year and to general price increases incurred by the operating properties net of properties sold on average approximately 80 of these costs are recovered from our tenants as expense reimbursements and included in our revenues 

the increase in general and administrative expense is related to additional salary costs for new employees hired to manage the first washington portfolio under a property management agreement with mcwr ii as well as staffing increases related to increases in our shopping center development program 

the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily related to new development properties recently completed and placed in service in the current year net of properties sold or if placed in service in the previous year were not operational for a full 12 months

index to financial statements our equity in income loss of investments in real estate partnerships coinvestment partnerships or joint ventures increased 55 million to 26 million in 2006 as follows in thousands 

 

 the increase was primarily a result of mcwr ii earning revenues for a full year from the first washington portfolio as compared to seven months during 2005 mcwr i recorded higher gains from the sale of real estate during 2006 as compared to 2005 columbia recorded lower gains from the sale of real estate during 2006 as compared to 2005

we review our real estate portfolio for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of an asset we determine whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property’s carrying value to an estimate of fair value based upon methods described in our critical accounting policies in the event a property is impaired we write down the asset to fair value for “heldandused” assets and to fair value less costs to sell for “heldfor sale” assets during 2006 and 2005 we established provisions for loss of 500000 and 550000 respectively to adjust operating properties to their estimated fair values 

income from discontinued operations was 631 million in 2006 related to eight operating and three development properties sold to unrelated parties for net proceeds of 1496 million income from discontinued operations was 651 million in 2005 related to nine operating and five development properties sold to unrelated parties for net proceeds of 1752 million and to the operations of shopping centers sold or classified as heldforsale in 2006 and 2005 in compliance with statement 144 if we sell an asset in the current year we are required to reclassify its operating income into discontinued operations for all prior periods this practice results in a reclassification of amounts previously reported as continuing operations into discontinued operations our income from discontinued operations is shown net of minority interest of exchangeable operating partnership units totaling 830793 and 13 million for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively and income taxes totaling 36 million for the year ended december 31 2005

index to financial statements net income for common stockholders increased 529 million to 1988 million in 2006 as compared with 1459 million in 2005 primarily related to increases in revenues described above and higher gains recognized from sale of real estate diluted earnings per share was 289 in 2006 as compared to 223 in 2005 or 30 higher 

environmental matters 

we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers and underground petroleum storage tanks ust’s we believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations generally we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to nonchlorinated solvent systems where available we have applied and been accepted into statesponsored environmental programs we have a blanket environmental insurance policy that covers us against thirdparty liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination we have also placed environmental insurance where possible on specific properties with known contamination in order to mitigate our environmental risk we monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites we also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so we estimate the cost associated with these legal obligations to be approximately 34 million all of which has been reserved we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material affect on our financial position liquidity or operations however we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies with respect to our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities that any previous owner occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants by the condition of nearby properties or by unrelated third parties or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us 

inflation 

inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers however more recently inflation has been increasing and may become a greater concern within the current economy substantially all of our longterm leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation such provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rent based on tenants’ gross sales which generally increase as prices rise andor escalation clauses which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices in addition many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years which permits us to seek increased rents upon rerental at market rates most of our leases require tenants to pay their prorata share of operating expenses including commonarea maintenance real estate taxes insurance and utilities thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

we are exposed to two components of interestrate risk our line has a variable interest rate that is based upon libor plus a spread of 55 basis points libor rates charged on the line change monthly based upon our current line balance a 1 increase in libor would equate to an additional 21 million of interest costs per year the spread on the line is dependent upon maintaining specific credit ratings if our credit ratings were downgraded the spread on the line would increase resulting in higher interest costs we are also exposed to higher interest rates when we refinance our existing longterm fixed rate debt the objective of our interestrate risk management is to limit the impact of interestrate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we borrow primarily at fixed interest rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interestrate swaps caps or treasury locks in order to mitigate our interestrate risk on a related financial instrument we do not enter into derivative or interestrate transactions for speculative purposes we have approximately 4281 million of fixed rate debt maturing in 2010 and 2011 which includes 4000 million of unsecured longterm debt during 2006 we entered into four forwardstarting interest rate swaps totaling 3967 million with fixed rates of 5399 5415 5399 and 5415 we designated these swaps as cash flow hedges to fix the future interest rates on the 4000 million of financing expected to occur in 2010 and 2011 

our interestrate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the table below presents the principal cash flows in thousands weighted average interest rates of remaining debt and the fair value of total debt in thousands as of december 31 2007 by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interestrate changes 

 

 as the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2007 it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date moreover because firm commitments are not presented in the table above the information presented above has limited predictive value as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interestrate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at that time and actual interest rates

 item 1 business tableend regency is a qualified real estate investment trust “reit” which began operations in 1993 our primary operating and investment goal is longterm growth in earnings per share and total shareholder return which we work to achieve by focusing on a strategy of owning operating and developing highquality community and neighborhood shopping centers that are tenanted by marketdominant grocers categoryleading anchors specialty retailers and restaurants located in areas with above average household incomes and population densities all of our operating investing and financing activities are performed through our operating partnership regency centers lp “rclp” rclp’s wholly owned subsidiaries and through its investments in joint ventures with third parties regency currently owns 99 of the outstanding operating partnership units of rclp 

at december 31 2006 we directly owned 218 shopping centers the “consolidated properties” located in 22 states representing 247 million square feet of gross leasable area “gla” our cost of these shopping centers is 35 billion before depreciation through joint ventures we own partial interests in 187 shopping centers the “unconsolidated properties” located in 24 states and the district of columbia representing 225 million square feet of gla our investment at cost in the unconsolidated properties is 4341 million certain portfolio information described within this form 10k is presented a on a combined basis which is a total of the consolidated properties and the unconsolidated properties b for our consolidated properties only and c for the unconsolidated properties that we own through joint ventures we believe that presenting the information under these methods provides a more complete understanding of the properties that we whollyown versus those that we partiallyown but for which we provide full property management asset management investing and financing services the shopping center portfolio that we manage on a combined basis represents 405 shopping centers located in 28 states and the district of columbia and contains 472 million square feet of gla 

we earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to marketleading grocers major retail anchors specialty sideshop retailers and restaurants including ground leasing or selling building pads outparcels to these tenants we experience growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates at currently owned shopping centers and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers community and neighborhood shopping centers generate substantial daily traffic by conveniently offering daily necessities and services this high traffic generates increased sales thereby driving higher occupancy and rentalrate growth which we expect will sustain our growth in earnings per share and increase the value of our portfolio over the long term 

we seek a range of strong national regional and local specialty retailers for the same reason that we choose to anchor our centers with leading grocers and major retailers who provide a mix of goods and services that meet consumer needs we have created a formal partnering process – the premier customer initiative “pci” – to promote mutually beneficial relationships with our specialty retailers the objective of pci is for regency to build a base of specialty tenants who represent the “bestinclass” operators in their respective merchandising categories such retailers reinforce the consumer appeal and other strengths of a center’s anchor help to stabilize a center’s occupancy reduce releasing downtime reduce tenant turnover and yield higher sustainable rents 

  

we grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions of operating centers and new shopping center development where we acquire the land and construct the building development is customer driven meaning we generally have an executed lease from the anchor before we start construction developments serve the growth needs of our anchors and specialty retailers resulting in modern shopping centers with longterm anchor leases that produce attractive returns on our invested capital this development process can require up to 36 months or longer from initial land or redevelopment acquisition through construction leaseup and stabilization of rental income depending upon the size of the project generally anchor tenants begin operating their stores prior to the completion of construction of the entire center resulting in rental income during the development phase 

we intend to maintain a conservative capital structure to fund our growth programs which should preserve our investmentgrade ratings our approach is founded on our selffunding business model this model utilizes center “recycling” as a key component which requires ongoing monitoring of each center to ensure that it continues to meet our investment standards we sell the operating properties that no longer measure up to our standards we also develop certain retail centers because of their attractive profit margins with the intent of selling them to joint ventures or other third parties upon completion these sale proceeds are redeployed into new higherquality developments and acquisitions that are expected to generate sustainable revenue growth and more attractive returns 

joint venturing of shopping centers also provides us with a capital source for new developments and acquisitions as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset and property management services as asset manager we are engaged by our partners to apply similar operating investment and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the joint ventures joint ventures grow their shopping center investments through acquisitions from third parties or direct purchases from regency although selling properties to joint ventures reduces our ownership interest we continue to share in the risks and rewards of centers that meet our high quality standards and longterm investment strategy 

competition 

we are among the largest publiclyheld owners of shopping centers in the nation based on revenues number of properties gross leasable area and market capitalization there are numerous companies and private individuals engaged in the ownership development acquisition and operation of shopping centers which compete with us in our targeted markets this results in competition for attracting anchor tenants as well as the acquisition of existing shopping centers and new development sites we believe that the principal competitive factors in attracting tenants in our market areas are location demographics rental costs tenant mix property age and maintenance we believe that our competitive advantages include our locations within our market areas the design quality of our shopping centers the strong demographics surrounding our shopping centers our relationships with our anchor tenants and our sideshop and outparcel retailers our pci program which allows us to provide retailers with multiple locations our practice of maintaining and renovating our shopping centers and our ability to source and develop new shopping centers 

changes in policies 

our board of directors establishes the policies that govern our investment and operating strategies including among others development and acquisition of shopping centers tenant and market focus debt and equity financing policies quarterly distributions to stockholders and reit tax status the board of directors may amend these policies at any time without a vote of our stockholders 

employees 

our headquarters are located at one independent drive suite 114 jacksonville florida we presently maintain 21 market offices nationwide where we conduct management leasing construction and investment activities at december 31 2006 we had 499 employees and we believe that our relations with our employees are good 

compliance with governmental regulations 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate certain hazardous or toxic substances at our shopping centers these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances the cost of required remediation and the owner’s liability for remediation could exceed the value of the 

  

property andor the aggregate assets of the owner the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent the property or borrow using the property as collateral we have a number of properties that could require or are currently undergoing varying levels of environmental remediation environmental remediation is not currently expected to have a material financial effect on us due to reserves for remediation insurance programs designed to mitigate the cost of remediation and various stateregulated programs that shift the responsibility and cost to the state

 item 1a risk factors tableend risk factors related to our industry and real estate investments 

our revenues and cash flow could be adversely affected by poor market conditions where properties are geographically concentrated 

regency’s performance depends on the economic conditions in markets in which our properties are concentrated during the year ended december 31 2006 our properties in california florida and texas accounted for 45 of our consolidated net operating income our revenues and cash available for distribution to stockholders could be adversely affected by this geographic concentration if market conditions in these areas such as an oversupply of retail space or a reduction in the demand for shopping centers become more competitive relative to other geographic areas 

loss of revenues from major tenants could reduce distributions to stockholders 

we derive significant revenues from anchor tenants such as kroger publix and safeway that occupy more than one center distributions to stockholders could be adversely affected by the loss of revenues in the event a major tenant 

 

  

  

  

  

 vacated anchor space including space owned by the anchor can reduce rental revenues generated by the shopping center because of the loss of the departed anchor tenant’s customer drawing power most anchors have the right to vacate and prevent retenanting by paying rent for the balance of the lease term if major tenants vacate a property then other tenants may be entitled to terminate their leases at the property 

downturns in the retailing industry likely will have a direct adverse impact on our revenues and cash flow 

our properties consist primarily of groceryanchored shopping centers our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space the market for retail space has been or could be adversely affected by any of the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 to the extent that any of these conditions occur they are likely to impact market rents for retail space and our cash available for distribution to stockholders 

  

unsuccessful development activities or a slowdown in development activities could reduce distributions to stockholders 

we actively pursue development activities as opportunities arise development activities require various government and other approvals for entitlements which can significantly delay the development process we may not recover our investment in development projects for which approvals are not received we incur other risks associated with development activities including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 if we sustain material losses due to an unsuccessful development project our cash flow available for distribution to stockholders will be reduced our earnings and cash flow available for distribution to stockholders also may be reduced if we experience a significant slowdown in our development activities 

uninsured loss may adversely affect distributions to stockholders 

we carry comprehensive liability fire flood extended coverage rental loss and environmental insurance for our properties with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties we believe that the insurance carried on our properties is adequate in accordance with industry standards there are however some types of losses such as from hurricanes terrorism wars or earthquakes which may be uninsurable or the cost of insuring against such losses may not be economically justifiable if an uninsured loss occurs we could lose both the invested capital in and anticipated revenues from the property but we would still be obligated to repay any recourse mortgage debt on the property in that event our distributions to stockholders could be reduced 

we face competition from numerous sources 

the ownership of shopping centers is highly fragmented with less than 10 owned by real estate investment trusts we face competition from other real estate investment trusts as well as from numerous small owners in the acquisition ownership and leasing of shopping centers we compete to develop shopping centers with other real estate investment trusts engaged in development activities as well as with local regional and national real estate developers 

we compete in the acquisition of properties through proprietary research that identifies opportunities in markets with high barriers to entry and higherthanaverage population growth and household income we seek to maximize rents per square foot by establishing relationships with supermarket chains that are first or second in their markets or other categoryleading anchors and leasing nonanchor space in multiple centers to national or regional tenants we compete to develop properties by applying our proprietary research methods to identify development and leasing opportunities and by preleasing a significant portion of a center before beginning construction 

there can be no assurance however that other real estate owners or developers will not utilize similar research methods and target the same markets and anchor tenants that we target these entities may successfully control these markets and tenants to our exclusion if we cannot successfully compete in our targeted markets our cash flow and therefore distributions to stockholders may be adversely affected 

costs of environmental remediation could reduce our cash flow available for distribution to stockholders 

under various federal state and local laws an owner or manager of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on the property these laws often impose liability 

  

without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances the cost of any required remediation could exceed the value of the property andor the aggregate assets of the owner 

we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers and underground petroleum storage tanks ust’s the presence of or the failure to properly remediate hazardous or toxic substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent a contaminated property or to borrow using the property as collateral any of these developments could reduce cash flow and distributions to stockholders 

risk factors related to our joint ventures and acquisition structure 

we do not have voting control over our joint venture investments so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued 

we have invested as a coventurer in the acquisition or development of properties as of december 31 2006 our investments in real estate partnerships represented 118 of our total assets these investments involve risks not present in a whollyowned project we do not have voting control over the ventures the coventurer might 1 have interests or goals that are inconsistent with our interests or goals or 2 otherwise impede our objectives the coventurer also might become insolvent or bankrupt 

our joint ventures account for a significant portion of our revenues and net income in the form of management fees and are an important part of our growth strategy the termination of our joint ventures could adversely affect distributions to stockholders 

our management fee income has increased significantly as our participation in joint ventures has increased if joint ventures owning a significant number of properties were dissolved for any reason we would lose the asset management and property management fees from these joint ventures which could adversely affect the amount of cash available for distribution to stockholders 

in addition termination of the joint ventures without replacing them with new joint ventures could adversely affect our growth strategy property sales to the joint ventures provide us with an important source of funding for additional developments and acquisitions without this source of capital our ability to grow and to increase distributions to stockholders could be adversely affected 

our partnership structure may limit our flexibility to manage our assets 

we invest in retail shopping centers through regency centers lp the operating partnership in which we currently own 99 of the outstanding common partnership units from time to time we acquire properties through our operating partnership in exchange for limited partnership interests this acquisition structure may permit limited partners who contribute properties to us to defer some if not all of the income tax liability that they would incur if they sold the property 

properties contributed to our operating partnership may have unrealized gain attributable to the difference between the fair market value and adjusted tax basis in the properties prior to contribution as a result the sale of these properties could cause adverse tax consequences to the limited partners who contributed them 

generally our operating partnership has no obligation to consider the tax consequences of its actions to any limited partner however our operating partnership may acquire properties in the future subject to material restrictions on refinancing or resale designed to minimize the adverse tax consequences to the limited partners who contribute those properties these restrictions could significantly reduce our flexibility to manage our assets by preventing us from reducing mortgage debt or selling a property when such a transaction might be in our best interest in order to reduce interest costs or dispose of an underperforming property 

  

risk factors related to our capital recycling and capital structure 

an increase in market capitalization rates could reduce the value of the centers we sell requiring us to sell more properties than initially planned in order to fund our development program an increase in property dispositions would dilute our earnings 

as part of our capital recycling program we sell operating properties that no longer meet our investment standards we also develop certain retail centers because of their attractive margins with the intent of selling them to joint ventures or other third parties for a profit these sale proceeds are used to fund the construction of new developments an increase in market capitalization rates could cause a reduction in the value of centers identified for sale which would have an adverse impact on our capital recycling program by reducing the amount of cash generated and profits realized in order to meet the cash requirements of our development program we may be required to sell more properties than initially planned which would have a dilutive impact on our earnings 

our debt financing may reduce distributions to stockholders 

we do not expect to generate sufficient funds from operations to make balloon principal payments when due on our debt if we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms we might be forced 1 to dispose of properties which might result in losses or 2 to obtain financing at unfavorable terms either could reduce the cash flow available for distributions to stockholders 

in addition if we cannot make required mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose on the property securing the mortgage causing the loss of cash flow from that property furthermore substantially all of our debt is crossdefaulted which means that a default under one loan could trigger defaults under other loans 

our organizational documents do not limit the amount of debt that may be incurred the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences including the following 

 

  

  

 covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition 

our revolving line of credit and our unsecured notes contain customary covenants including compliance with financial ratios such as ratios of total debt to gross asset value and fixed charge coverage ratios our line of credit also restricts our ability to enter into a transaction that would result in a change of control these covenants may limit our operational flexibility and our acquisition activities moreover if we breach any of these covenants the resulting default could cause the acceleration of our indebtedness even in the absence of a payment default if we are not able to refinance our indebtedness after a default or unable to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms distributions to stockholders and our financial condition would be adversely affected 

we depend on external sources of capital which may not be available in the future 

to qualify as a reit we must among other things distribute to our stockholders each year at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding any net capital gains because of these distribution requirements we likely will not be able to fund all future capital needs including capital for acquisitions with income from operations we therefore will have to rely on thirdparty sources of capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all our access to thirdparty sources of capital depends on a number of things including the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings in addition our line of credit imposes covenants that limit our flexibility in obtaining other financing such as a prohibition on negative pledge agreements 

  

additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders’ interests and additional debt financing may substantially increase our degree of leverage 

risk factors related to interest rates and the market for our stock 

increased interest rates may reduce distributions to stockholders 

we are obligated on floating rate debt and if we do not eliminate our exposure to increases in interest rates through interest rate protection or cap agreements these increases may reduce cash flow and our ability to make distributions to stockholders 

although swap agreements enable us to convert floating rate debt to fixed rate debt and cap agreements enable us to cap our maximum interest rate they expose us to the risk that the counterparties to these hedge agreements may not perform which could increase our exposure to rising interest rates if we enter into swap agreements decreases in interest rates will increase our interest expense as compared to the underlying floating rate debt this could result in our making payments to unwind these agreements such as in connection with a prepayment of the floating rate debt cap agreements do not protect us from increases up to the capped rate 

increased market interest rates could reduce our stock prices 

the annual dividend rate on our common stock as a percentage of its market price may influence the trading price of our stock an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers to demand a higher annual dividend rate which could adversely affect the market price of our stock a decrease in the market price of our common stock could reduce our ability to raise additional equity in the public markets selling common stock at a decreased market price would have a dilutive impact on existing shareholders 

risk factors related to federal income tax laws 

if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 

we believe that we qualify for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes and we plan to operate so that we can continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit if we qualify as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on our income that we distribute currently to our stockholders many of the reit requirements however are highly technical and complex the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances some of which may not be totally within our control and some of which involve questions of interpretation for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income must come from specific passive sources like rent that are itemized in the reit tax laws there can be no assurance that the irs or a court would agree with the positions we have taken in interpreting the reit requirements we also are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains the fact that we hold many of our assets through joint ventures and their subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status furthermore congress and the internal revenue service might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult or impossible for us to remain qualified as a reit 

also unless the irs granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we would remain disqualified as a reit for four years following the year we first failed to qualify if we failed to qualify as a reit we would have to pay significant income taxes this likely would have a significant adverse affect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to pay any dividends to stockholders 

even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we are required to pay certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from “prohibited transactions” that income will be subject to a 100 tax in general prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business the determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale while we have undertaken a significant number of asset sales in recent years we do not believe that those sales should be considered prohibited transactions but there can be no assurance that the irs would not contend otherwise 

  

in addition any net taxable income earned directly by our taxable affiliates including regency realty group inc is subject to federal and state corporate income tax several provisions of the laws applicable to reits and their subsidiaries ensure that a taxable reit subsidiary will be subject to an appropriate level of federal income taxation for example a taxable reit subsidiary is limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to an affiliated reit in addition a reit has to pay a 100 penalty tax on some payments that it receives if the economic arrangements between the reit the reit’s tenants and the taxable reit subsidiary are not comparable to similar arrangements between unrelated parties finally some state and local jurisdictions may tax some of our income even though as a reit we are not subject to federal income tax on that income to the extent that we and our affiliates are required to pay federal state and local taxes we will have less cash available for distributions to our stockholders 

a reit may not own securities in any one issuer if the value of those securities exceeds 5 of the value of the reit’s total assets or the securities owned by the reit represent more than 10 of the issuer’s outstanding voting securities or 10 of the value of the issuer’s outstanding securities an exception to these tests allows a reit to own securities of a subsidiary that exceed the 5 value test and the 10 value tests if the subsidiary elects to be a “taxable reit subsidiary” we are not able to own securities of taxable reit subsidiaries that represent in the aggregate more than 20 of the value of our total assets we currently own more than 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of regency realty group inc which has elected to be a taxable reit subsidiary 

risk factors related to our ownership limitations the florida business corporation act and certain other matters 

restrictions on the ownership of our capital stock to preserve our reit status could delay or prevent a change in control 

ownership of more than 7 by value of our outstanding capital stock by certain persons is restricted for the purpose of maintaining our qualification as a reit with certain exceptions this 7 limitation may discourage a change in control and may also i deter tender offers for our capital stock which offers may be attractive to our stockholders or ii limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their capital stock that might otherwise exist if an investor attempted to assemble a block in excess of 7 of our outstanding capital stock or to effect a change in control 

the issuance of our capital stock could delay or prevent a change in control 

our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to 30000000 shares of preferred stock and 10000000 shares of special common stock and to establish the preferences and rights of any shares issued the issuance of preferred stock or special common stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control even if a change in control were in our stockholders’ interest the provisions of the florida business corporation act regarding control share acquisitions and affiliated transactions could also deter potential acquisitions by preventing the acquiring party from voting the common stock it acquires or consummating a merger or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of our disinterested stockholders

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview and operating philosophy 

regency is a qualified real estate investment trust “reit” which began operations in 1993 our primary operating and investment goal is longterm growth in earnings per share and total shareholder return which we work to achieve by focusing on a strategy of owning operating and developing highquality community and neighborhood shopping centers that are tenanted by marketdominant grocers categoryleading anchors specialty retailers and restaurants located in areas with above average household incomes and population densities all of our operating investing and financing activities are performed through our operating partnership regency centers lp “rclp” rclp’s wholly owned subsidiaries and through its investments in joint ventures with third parties regency currently owns 99 of the outstanding operating partnership units of rclp 

at december 31 2006 we directly owned 218 shopping centers the “consolidated properties” located in 22 states representing 247 million square feet of gross leasable area “gla” our cost of these shopping centers is 35 billion before depreciation through joint ventures we own partial interests in 187 shopping centers the “unconsolidated properties” located in 24 states and the district of columbia representing 225 million square feet of gla our investment at cost in the unconsolidated properties is 4341 million certain portfolio information described below is presented a on a combined basis which is a total of the consolidated properties and the unconsolidated properties b for our consolidated properties only and c for the unconsolidated properties that we own through joint ventures we believe that presenting the information under these methods provides a more complete understanding of the properties that we whollyown versus those that we partiallyown but for which we provide full property management asset management investing and financing services the shopping center portfolio that we manage on a combined basis represents 405 shopping centers located in 28 states and the district of columbia and contains 472 million square feet of gla 

we earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to marketleading grocers major retail anchors specialty sideshop retailers and restaurants including ground leasing or selling building pads outparcels to these tenants we experience growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates at currently owned shopping centers and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers community and neighborhood shopping centers generate substantial daily traffic by conveniently offering daily necessities and services this high traffic generates increased sales thereby driving higher occupancy and rentalrate growth which we expect will sustain our growth in earnings per share and increase the value of our portfolio over the long term 

we seek a range of strong national regional and local specialty retailers for the same reason that we choose to anchor our centers with leading grocers and major retailers who provide a mix of goods and services that meet consumer needs we have created a formal partnering process — the premier customer initiative “pci” — to promote mutually beneficial relationships with our specialty retailers the objective of pci is for regency to build a base of specialty tenants who represent the “bestinclass” operators in their respective merchandising categories such retailers reinforce the consumer appeal and other strengths of a center’s anchor help to stabilize a center’s occupancy reduce releasing downtime reduce tenant turnover and yield higher sustainable rents 

we grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions of operating centers and new shopping center development where we acquire the land and construct the building development is customer driven meaning we generally have an executed lease from the anchor before we start construction developments serve the growth needs of our anchors and specialty retailers resulting in modern shopping centers with longterm anchor leases that produce attractive returns on our invested capital this development process can require up to 36 months or longer from initial land or redevelopment acquisition through construction leaseup and stabilization of rental income depending upon the size of the project generally anchor tenants begin operating their stores prior to the completion of construction of the entire center resulting in rental income during the development phase 

  

we intend to maintain a conservative capital structure to fund our growth programs which should preserve our investmentgrade ratings our approach is founded on our selffunding business model this model utilizes center “recycling” as a key component which requires ongoing monitoring of each center to ensure that it continues to meet our investment standards we sell the operating properties that no longer measure up to our standards we also develop certain retail centers because of their attractive profit margins with the intent of selling them to joint ventures or other third parties upon completion these sale proceeds are redeployed into new higherquality developments and acquisitions that are expected to generate sustainable revenue growth and more attractive returns 

joint venturing of shopping centers also provides us with a capital source for new developments and acquisitions as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset and property management services as asset manager we are engaged by our partners to apply similar operating investment and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the joint ventures joint ventures grow their shopping center investments through acquisitions from third parties or direct purchases from regency although selling properties to joint ventures reduces our ownership interest we continue to share in the risks and rewards of centers that meet our high quality standards and longterm investment strategy we have no obligations or liabilities of the joint ventures beyond our ownership interest percentage 

we have identified certain significant risks and challenges affecting our industry and we are addressing them accordingly an economic downturn could result in declines in occupancy levels at our shopping centers which would reduce our rental revenues however we believe that our investment focus on neighborhood and community shopping centers that conveniently provide daily necessities will minimize the impact of a downturn in the economy increased competition from supercenters and industry consolidation could result in retailer store closings however we closely monitor the operating performance and tenants’ sales in our shopping centers that operate near supercenters as well as those tenants operating retail formats that are experiencing significant changes in competition or business practice we also continue to monitor retail trends and merchandise our shopping centers based on consumer demand a significant slowdown in retailer demand for new stores could cause a corresponding reduction in our shopping center development program that would likely reduce our future rental revenues and profits from development sales as well as increase our operating expenses as a result of reducing our capitalized employee costs see critical accounting policies and estimates – capitalization of costs described further below however based upon our current pipeline of development projects undergoing due diligence which is our best indication of retailer expansion plans the presence of our development teams in key markets in combination with their excellent relationships with leading anchor tenants we believe that we will be able to sustain our development program at current averages in the foreseeable three to five year period 

  

shopping center portfolio 

the following tables summarize general operating statistics related to our shopping center portfolio which we use to evaluate and monitor our performance the portfolio information below is presented a on a combined basis b for consolidated properties and c for unconsolidated properties the definitions of which are provided above 

 

 we seek to reduce our operating and leasing risks through diversification which we achieve by geographically diversifying our shopping centers avoiding dependence on any single property market or tenant and owning a portion of our shopping centers through joint ventures 

  

the following table is a list of the shopping centers summarized by state and in order of largest holdings presented on a combined basis 

 

   

the following table is a list of the shopping centers summarized by state and in order of largest holdings presented for the consolidated properties

 the unconsolidated properties are encumbered by mortgage loans of 24 billion 

  

the following summarizes the four largest grocery tenants occupying our shopping centers at december 31 2006 

 

    although base rent is supported by longterm lease contracts tenants who file bankruptcy are able to cancel their leases and close their related stores in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues we continually monitor industry trends and sales data to help us identify declines in retail categories or tenants who might be experiencing financial difficulties we continue to monitor the video rental industry while its operators transition to different rental formats including online rental programs at december 31 2006 we had leases with 137 video rental stores representing 98 million of annual rental income pertaining to consolidated properties and our pro rata share of the unconsolidated properties we are not aware at this time of the current or pending bankruptcy of any of our tenants that would cause a significant reduction in our revenues and no tenant represents more than 7 of the total of our annual base rental revenues and our prorata share of the base revenues of the unconsolidated properties 

liquidity and capital resources 

we expect that cash generated from operating activities will provide the necessary funds to pay our operating expenses interest expense scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness capital expenditures necessary to maintain and improve our shopping centers and dividends to stockholders net cash provided by operating activities was 2168 million 2054 million and 1815 million for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively during 2006 2005 and 2004 we incurred capital expenditures of 140 million 144 million and 117 million to improve our shopping centers we paid scheduled principal payments of 45 million 55 million and 57 million to our lenders on mortgage loans and we paid dividends to our stockholders and unit holders of 1852 million 1674 million and 1548 million respectively the increase in dividends during 2006 was primarily related to a 200 million equity offering completed during 2005 as described below under equity capital transactions and an increase in our annual dividend rate of 82 

we intend to continue to grow our portfolio by investing in shopping centers through ground up development of new centers or acquisition of existing centers because development and acquisition activities are discretionary in nature they are not expected to burden the capital resources we have currently available for liquidity requirements we expect to meet our longterm capital investment requirements for development and acquisitions as well as the redemption of preferred stock and the repayment of maturing debt from i residual cash generated from operating activities after the payments described above ii proceeds from the sale of real estate iii joint venturing of real estate iv refinancing of debt and v equity raised in the capital markets 

  

the following table summarizes net cash flows related to operating investing and financing activities in thousands 

 

 at december 31 2006 we had an unlimited amount under our shelf registration for equity securities based on the new securities and exchange commission “sec” rules and rclp had 600 million available for debt under its shelf registration we believe that our ability to access the capital markets as a source of funds to meet capital requirements is good 

at december 31 2006 we had 47 properties under construction or undergoing major renovations on a combined basis which when completed will represent a net investment of 11 billion after projected sales of adjacent land and outparcels this compares to 31 projects that were under construction at the end of 2005 representing an investment of 7351 million upon completion we estimate that we will earn an average return on our investment on our current development projects of 79 on a fully allocated basis including direct internal costs and the cost to acquire any residual interests held by minority development partners these average returns are approximately 110 basis points less than the projected yields on the developments that were under construction at the end of 2005 which is primarily the result of higher costs associated with the acquisition of land and construction while the average return on investment has declined from historical levels the company believes that our development returns are sufficient on a risk adjusted basis costs necessary to complete the current development projects net of projected land sales are estimated to be 532 million and will likely be expended through 2010 the costs to complete these developments will be funded from our 500 million line of credit which had 379 million of available funding at december 31 2006 and from expected proceeds from the future sale of shopping centers as part of the capital recycling program described above in february 2007 we increased the commitment of our line of credit to 600 million with the ability to expand it to 750 million as discussed further below in notes payable 

on april 11 2006 we acquired a 100 interest in a shopping center for a purchase price of 631 million which includes the assumption of 440 million in debt the acquisition was accounted for as a business combination purchase and the results of its operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition during 2006 we also acquired six shopping centers through our joint ventures for a combined purchase price of 1593 million as further described below 

during 2006 we sold 100 of our interest in 11 properties for proceeds of 1496 million net of debt repayments and closing costs the operating income and gains from these properties and properties classified as held for sale are included in discontinued operations we also sold partial interests in six completed development properties to our joint ventures for 1350 million or 100 million net after excluding our ownership interests in the joint ventures the details of the sales to joint ventures are further described below 

  

investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships joint ventures 

at december 31 2006 we had investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships of 4341 million the following is a summary of unconsolidated combined assets and liabilities of these joint ventures and our prorata share see note below at december 31 2006 and 2005 dollars in thousands 

 

  we account for all investments in which we own 50 or less and do not have a controlling financial interest using the equity method we have determined that these investments are not variable interest entities and therefore are subject to the voting interest model in determining our basis of accounting major decisions including property acquisitions not meeting preestablished investment criteria dispositions financings annual budgets and dissolution of the ventures are subject to the approval of all partners investments in real estate partnerships are primarily composed of joint ventures where we invest with three coinvestment partners and a recently formed openend real estate fund “regency retail partners” as further described below in addition to earning our prorata share of net income in each of these partnerships we receive fees for asset management property management investment and financing services during the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 we received fees from these joint ventures of 308 million 268 million and 93 million respectively our investments in real estate partnerships as of december 31 2006 and 2005 consist of the following in thousands

on june 1 2005 mcwr ii closed on the acquisition of a retail shopping center portfolio the “first washington portfolio” for a purchase price of approximately 28 billion including the assumption of approximately 686 million of mortgage debt and the issuance of approximately 16 billion of new mortgage loans on the properties acquired the first washington portfolio acquisition was accounted for as a purchase business combination by mcwr ii at december 31 2005 mcwr ii was owned 6495 by an affiliate of mcw 3495 by regency and 01 by macquarieregency management llc “us manager” us manager is owned 50 by regency and 50 by an affiliate of macquarie bank limited on january 13 2006 we sold a portion of our investment in mcwr ii to mcw for net cash of 1132 million and reduced our ownership interest from 35 to 2495 and recorded a gain of 95 million on the partial sale of our interest the proceeds from the sale were used to reduce our unsecured line of credit at december 31 2006 mcwr ii is owned 75 by mcw’s affiliate 2490 by regency and 01 by us manager including our share of us manager our effective ownership is 2495 and is reflected as such under the equity method in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

  

as of december 31 2006 mcwr ii owned 97 shopping centers had total assets of 27 billion and a net loss of 247 million for the year ended our share of mcwr ii’s total assets and net loss was 6760 million and 70 million respectively as a result of the significant amount of depreciation and amortization expense being recorded by mcwr ii in connection with the acquisition of the first washington portfolio the joint venture may continue to report a net loss in future years but is expected to produce positive cash flow from operations during 2006 mcwr ii sold eight shopping centers for 1224 million to unrelated parties for a gain of 15 million mcwr ii acquired four shopping centers from us for a sales price of 624 million or 468 million on a net basis after excluding our 2495 ownership interest during 2005 mcwr ii sold one shopping center for 97 million to an unrelated party with a gain of 35127 

our investment in the four joint ventures with mcw totals 3030 million and represents 83 of our total assets at december 31 2006 our prorata share of the assets and net loss of these ventures was 8575 million and 16 million respectively which represents 234 and less than 1 of our total assets and net income available for common stockholders respectively 

in december 2006 we formed regency retail partners the “fund” an openend infinitelife investment fund in which we currently have an ownership interest of 268 we expect to reduce our ownership interest to 20 during 2007 as other partners are admitted into the fund the fund will have the exclusive right to acquire all future regencydeveloped large format community centers upon stabilization that meet the fund’s investment criteria a community center is generally defined as a shopping center with at least 250000 square feet of gla including tenantowned gla

recognition of gains from sales to joint ventures is recorded on only that portion of the sales not attributable to our ownership interest the gains and operations are not recorded as discontinued operations because of our continuing involvement in these shopping centers columbia regcal the joint ventures with mcw and the fund intend to continue to acquire retail shopping centers some of which they may acquire directly from us for those properties acquired from unrelated parties we are required to contribute our prorata share of the purchase price to the partnerships 

contractual obligations 

we have debt obligations related to our mortgage loans unsecured notes and our unsecured line of credit as described further below we have shopping centers that are subject to noncancelable longterm ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to us to construct andor operate a shopping center in addition we have noncancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from which we conduct our business the table excludes obligations for approximately 38 million related to environmental remediation as discussed below under environmental matters as the timing of the remediation is not currently known the table also excludes obligations related to construction or development contracts because payments are only due upon the satisfactory performance under the contract costs necessary to complete the 47 development projects currently in process are estimated to be 532 million and will likely be expended through 2010 the following table summarizes our debt maturities including interest excluding recorded debt premiums that are not obligations and obligations under noncancelable operating leases as of december 31 2006 including our prorata share of obligations within unconsolidated joint ventures in thousands 

  

  notes payable 

outstanding debt at december 31 2006 and 2005 consists of the following in thousands 

 

 mortgage loans are secured and may be prepaid but could be subject to yield maintenance premiums mortgage loans are generally due in monthly installments of interest and principal and mature over various terms through 2017 variable interest rates on mortgage loans are currently based on libor plus a spread in a range of 90 to 130 basis points fixed interest rates on mortgage loans range from 522 to 895 and average 653 

at december 31 2006 we had an unsecured revolving line of credit the “line” with an outstanding balance of 121 million contractual interest rates on the line which are based on libor plus 75 were 6125 and 5125 at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively the spread that we pay on the line is dependent upon maintaining specific investmentgrade ratings we are also required to comply and are in compliance with certain financial covenants such as minimum net worth total liabilities to gross asset value “gav” recourse secured debt to gav fixed charge coverage and other covenants customary with this type of unsecured financing the line is used primarily to finance the development and acquisition of real estate but is also available for general workingcapital purposes 

  

in february 2007 we entered into a new loan agreement under the line which increased the commitment to 600 million with the right to increase the facility size to 750 million the contractual interest rate will be reduced to libor plus 55 based upon our current debt ratings and will have an initial term of 48 months followed by a 12 month extension option the line will continue to be subject to similar financial covenants and investmentgrade ratings as exist currently 

as of december 31 2006 scheduled principal repayments on notes payable and the line were as follows in thousands 

 

 our investments in real estate partnerships had notes and mortgage loans payable of 24 billion at december 31 2006 which mature through 2028 our proportionate share of these loans was 6108 million of which 947 had average fixed interest rates of 52 and the remaining had variable interest rates based on libor plus a spread in a range of 90 to 125 basis points the loans are primarily nonrecourse but for those that are guaranteed by a joint venture our liability does not extend beyond our ownership percentage of the joint venture 

we are exposed to capital market risk such as changes in interest rates in order to manage the volatility related to interestrate risk we originate new debt with fixed interest rates or we may enter into interestrate hedging arrangements we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes we engage outside experts who evaluate and make recommendations about hedging strategies when appropriate we account for derivative instruments under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended “statement 133” on march 10 2006 we entered into four forwardstarting interest rate swaps totaling 3967 million with fixed rates of 5399 5415 5399 and 5415 the company designated these swaps as cash flow hedges to fix the rate on 400 million of new financing expected to occur in 2010 and 2011 the proceeds of which will be used to repay maturing debt at that time the change in fair value of these swaps from inception was a liability of 29 million at december 31 2006 and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income loss 

at december 31 2006 880 of our total debt had fixed interest rates compared with 851 at december 31 2005 we intend to limit the percentage of variable interestrate debt to be no more than 30 of total debt which we believe to be an acceptable risk currently our variable rate debt represented 120 of our total debt based upon the variable interestrate debt outstanding at december 31 2006 if variable interest rates were to increase by 1 our annual interest expense would increase by 19 million 

  

equity transactions 

from time to time we issue equity in the form of exchangeable operating partnership units or preferred units of rclp or in the form of common or preferred stock of regency centers corporation as previously discussed these sources of longterm equity financing allow us to fund our growth while maintaining a conservative capital structure 

preferred units 

we have issued preferred units in various amounts since 1998 the net proceeds of which were used to reduce the balance of the line we issue preferred units primarily to institutional investors in private placements generally the preferred units may be exchanged by the holders for cumulative redeemable preferred stock at an exchange rate of one share for one unit the preferred units and the related preferred stock are not convertible into regency common stock at december 31 2006 and 2005 only the series d preferred units were outstanding with a face value of 50 million and a fixed distribution rate of 745 these units may be called by us in 2009 and have no stated maturity or mandatory redemption included in the series d preferred units are original issuance costs of 842023 that will be expensed if they are redeemed in the future

critical accounting policies and estimates 

knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial results and discussion and analysis of these results the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities at a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period these accounting estimates are based upon but not limited to our judgments about historical results current economic activity and industry accounting standards they are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness however the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates 

  

revenue recognition and tenant receivables – tenant receivables represent revenues recognized in our financial statements and include base rent percentage rent and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs insurance and real estate taxes we analyze tenant receivables historical bad debt levels customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts in addition we analyze the accounts of tenants in bankruptcy and we estimate the recovery of prepetition and postpetition claims our reported net income is directly affected by our estimate of the recoverability of tenant receivables 

recognition of gains from the sales of real estate – we account for profit recognition on sales of real estate in accordance with sfas statement no 66 “accounting for sales of real estate” profits from sales of real estate will not be recognized by us unless i a sale has been consummated ii the buyer’s initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property iii we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership and iv we do not have significant continuing involvement with the property recognition of gains from sales to joint ventures is recorded on only that portion of the sales not attributable to our ownership interest 

capitalization of costs – we capitalize the acquisition of land the construction of buildings and other specifically identifiable development costs incurred by recording them into “properties in development” on our consolidated balance sheets other development costs include predevelopment costs essential to the development of the property as well as interest real estate taxes and direct employee costs incurred during the development period predevelopment costs are incurred prior to land acquisition during the due diligence phase and include contract deposits legal engineering and other professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center if we were to determine that the development of a specific project undergoing due diligence was no longer probable we would immediately expense all related capitalized predevelopment costs not considered recoverable interest costs are capitalized into each development project based on applying our weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the actual development costs expended we cease interest capitalization when the property is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements we have a large staff of employees who support the due diligence land acquisition construction leasing financial analysis and accounting of our development program all direct internal costs related to development activities are capitalized as part of each development project if future accounting standards limit the amount of internal costs that may be capitalized or if our development activity were to decline significantly without a proportionate decrease in internal costs we could incur a significant increase in our operating expenses 

real estate acquisitions – upon acquisition of operating real estate properties we estimate the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land building and improvements and identified intangible assets liabilities consisting of above and belowmarket leases inplace leases and tenant relationships and assumed debt in accordance with sfas no 141 “business combinations” “statement 141” based on these estimates we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities we evaluate the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets each reporting period and account for any changes in estimated useful lives over the revised remaining useful life 

valuation of real estate investments – our longlived assets primarily real estate held for investment are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted the review involves a number of assumptions and estimates used to determine whether impairment exists depending on the asset we use varying methods such as i estimating future cash flows ii determining resale values by market or iii applying a capitalization rate to net operating income using prevailing rates in a given market these methods of determining fair value can fluctuate significantly as a result of a number of factors including changes in the general economy of those markets in which we operate tenant credit quality and demand for new retail stores if we determine that the carrying amount of a property is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value we will write down the asset to fair value for “heldandused” assets and to fair value less costs to sell for “heldforsale” assets 

  

discontinued operations – the application of current accounting principles that govern the classification of any of our properties as heldforsale on the balance sheet or the presentation of results of operations and gains on the sale of these properties as discontinued requires management to make certain significant judgments in evaluating whether a property meets the criteria set forth by sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment and disposal of longlived assets” “statement 144” the company makes a determination as to the point in time that it can be reasonably certain that a sale will be consummated given the nature of all real estate sales contracts it is not unusual for such contracts to allow potential buyers a period of time to evaluate the property prior to formal acceptance of the contract in addition certain other matters critical to the final sale such as financing arrangements often remain pending even upon contract acceptance as a result properties under contract may not close within the expected time period or may not close at all due to these uncertainties it is not likely that the company can meet the criteria of statement 144 prior to the sale formally closing therefore any properties categorized as held for sale represent only those properties that management has determined are likely to close within the requirements set forth in statement 144 the company also makes judgments regarding the extent of involvement it will have with a property subsequent to its sale in order to determine if the results of operations and gain on sale should be reflected as discontinued consistent with statement 144 any property sold to an entity in which the company has significant continuing involvement most often joint ventures is not considered to be discontinued in addition any property which the company sells to an unrelated third party but retains a property or asset management function is also not considered discontinued therefore only properties sold or to be sold to unrelated third parties that the company in its judgment has no significant continuing involvement with are classified as discontinued 

investments in real estate joint ventures – in addition to owning real estate directly we invest in real estate through our coinvestment joint ventures joint venturing provides us with a capital source to acquire real estate and to earn our prorata share of the net income from the joint ventures in addition to fees for services as asset and property manager we conduct the business of the unconsolidated properties held in the joint ventures in the same way that we conduct the business of the consolidated properties that are whollyowned therefore the critical accounting policies as described are also applicable to our investments in the joint ventures we account for all investments in which we own 50 or less and do not have a controlling financial interest using the equity method we have determined that these investments are not variable interest entities as defined in the fasb interpretation no 46r “consolidation of variable interest entities” and do not require consolidation under eitf issue no 045 “determining whether a general partner or the general partners as a group controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights” and therefore are subject to the voting interest model in determining our basis of accounting major decisions including property acquisitions and dispositions financings annual budgets and dissolution of the ventures are subject to the approval of all partners or in the case of the fund its advisory committee 

income tax status – the prevailing assumption underlying the operation of our business is that we will continue to operate in order to qualify as a reit as defined under the internal revenue code we are required to meet certain income and asset tests on a periodic basis to ensure that we continue to qualify as a reit as a reit we are allowed to reduce taxable income by all or a portion of our distributions to stockholders we evaluate the transactions that we enter into and determine their impact on our reit status determining our taxable income calculating distributions and evaluating transactions requires us to make certain judgments and estimates as to the positions we take in our interpretation of the internal revenue code because many types of transactions are susceptible to varying interpretations under federal and state income tax laws and regulations our positions are subject to change at a later date upon final determination by the taxing authorities 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the sec’s staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 108 “considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements” this bulletin requires that registrants quantify errors using both a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in a misstated amount that when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered is material the guidance in this bulletin must be applied to financial reports covering the first fiscal year ending after november 15 2006 the adoption of sab 108 did not have a material affect on our consolidated financial statements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement no 157 “fair value measurements” this statement defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements this statement applies to accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements except for sharebased payments transactions under fasb statement no 123r this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 as statement no 157 does not require any new fair value measurements or remeasurements of previously computed fair values we do not believe adoption of this statement will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” fin 48 clarifies the accounting and reporting for uncertainties in income tax law this interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns under fin 48 tax positions shall initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities such tax positions shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts we will adopt this interpretation in the first quarter of 2007 the cumulative effects if any of applying this interpretation will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption we have begun the process of evaluating the expected effect of fin 48 and the adoption is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

in april 2006 the fasb issued fsp fin 46r6 “determining the variability to be considered in applying fasb interpretation no 46r” that became effective beginning in the third quarter of 2006 fsp fin no 46r6 clarifies that the variability to be considered in applying interpretation 46r shall be based on an analysis of the design of the variable interest entity the adoption of this fsp has not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

in october 2005 the fasb issued staff position no fas 131 “accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period” this fsp requires that rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases incurred during a construction period be recognized as rental expense however fsp no fas 131 does not address lessees that account for the sale or rental of real estate projects under fasb statement no 67 “accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects” and therefore we will continue to apply fasb statement no 67 

  

results from operations 

comparison of the years ended december 31 2006 to 2005 

at december 31 2006 on a combined basis we were operating or developing 405 shopping centers as compared to 393 shopping centers at the end of 2005 we identify our shopping centers as either development properties or operating properties development properties are defined as properties that are in the construction or initial leaseup process and have not reached their initial full occupancy reaching full occupancy generally means achieving at least 93 leased and rent paying on newly constructed or renovated gla at december 31 2006 on a combined basis we were developing 47 properties as compared to 31 properties at the end of 2005 

our revenues increased by 397 million or 10 to 4203 million in 2006 as summarized in the following table in thousands 

 

 the increase in revenues was primarily related to higher minimum rent from growth in rental rates from renewing expiring leases or releasing vacant space in the operating properties and from new minimum rent generated from recently completed developments commencing operations in the current year in addition to collecting minimum rent from our tenants we also collect percentage rent based upon their sales volumes recoveries from tenants represents reimbursements from tenants for their prorata share of the operating maintenance and real estate tax expenses that we incur to operate our shopping centers 

we earn fees for asset management property management leasing investing and financing services that we provide to our joint ventures and third parties summarized as follows in thousands 

 

 property management fees increased in 2006 as a result of managing the first washington portfolio for mcwr ii which was acquired on june 1 2005 this also resulted in higher leasing commissions earned during 2006 investing and financing fees are transaction based and not necessarily recurring the fees earned in 2005 related to the initial acquisition of the first washington portfolio by mcwr ii during 2006 we earned additional fees from mcwr ii for achieving certain income performance results related to the first washington portfolio although lower than the amount earned in 2005 

  

our equity in income of real estate partnerships joint ventures increased 55 million to 26 million in 2006 as follows in thousands 

 

 the increase was primarily a result of mcwr ii earning revenues for a full year from the first washington portfolio as compared to seven months during 2005 and incurring lower amortization expense in the first washington portfolio during 2006 mcwr i recorded higher gains in 2006 from the sale of real estate as compared to 2005 

our operating expenses increased by 350 million or 17 to 2405 million in 2006 related to increased operating and maintenance costs general and administrative costs and depreciation expense as further described below the following table summarizes our operating expenses in thousands 

 

 the increase in operating maintenance and real estate taxes was primarily due to shopping center developments that were recently completed and did not incur operating expenses for a full 12 months during the previous year and to general price increases incurred by the operating properties on average approximately 80 of these costs are recovered from our tenants as expense reimbursements and included in our revenues 

the increase in general and administrative expense is related to additional salary costs for new employees hired to manage the first washington portfolio under a property management agreement with mcwr ii as well as staffing increases related to increases in our shopping center development program 

the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily related to new development properties recently completed and placed in service in the current year or if placed in service in the previous year were not operational for a full 12 months 

the increase in other expenses pertains to an increase in the income tax provision of regency realty group inc “rrg” our taxable reit subsidiary from 493709 in 2005 to 118 million in 2006 rrg is subject to federal and state income taxes and files separate tax returns rclp also incurred intangible taxes of 18 million in 2006 as compared to 352416 in 2005 

our interest expense net of interest capitalization decreased 68 million to 797 million in 2006 from 

  

865 million in 2005 this decrease is attributable to a higher level of interest incurred that is directly related to the construction of new shopping centers and therefore capitalized into properties under development during 2006 we capitalized interest of 240 million as compared to 124 million in 2005 the average balance of development in process was 553 million in 2006 as compared to 390 million in 2005 average interest rates on our outstanding debt increased to 645 at december 31 2006 compared to 634 at december 31 2005 our weighted average outstanding debt at december 31 2006 and 2005 was 16 billion 

gains from the sale of real estate were 656 million in 2006 as compared to 190 million in 2005 2006 includes 202 million from the sale of 30 outparcels for net proceeds of 535 million 359 million from the sale of six shopping centers to joint ventures for net proceeds of 1227 million and a 95 million gain related to the partial sale of our interest in mcwr ii as discussed previously 2005 includes 87 million in gains from the sale of 26 outparcels for net proceeds of 290 million and 103 million in gains related to the sale of three development properties and one operating property these gains are included in continuing operations rather than discontinued operations because they were either properties that had no operating income or they were properties sold to joint ventures where we have continuing involvement through our equity investment 

we review our real estate portfolio for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of an asset we determine whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property’s carrying value to an estimate of fair value based upon methods described in our critical accounting policies in the event a property is impaired we write down the asset to fair value for “heldandused” assets and to fair value less costs to sell for “heldfor sale” assets during 2006 and 2005 we established provisions for loss of 500000 and 550000 respectively to adjust operating properties to their estimated fair values 

income from discontinued operations was 634 million in 2006 related to eight operating and three development properties sold to unrelated parties for net proceeds of 1496 million income from discontinued operations was 655 million in 2005 related to nine operating and five development properties sold to unrelated parties for net proceeds of 1752 million and to the operations of shopping centers sold or classified as heldforsale in 2006 and 2005 in compliance with statement 144 if we sell an asset in the current year we are required to reclassify its operating income into discontinued operations for all prior periods this practice results in a reclassification of amounts previously reported as continuing operations into discontinued operations our income from discontinued operations is shown net of minority interest of exchangeable operating partnership units totaling 881971 and 13 million for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively and income taxes totaling 36 million for the year ended december 31 2005 

minority interest of preferred units declined 44 million to 37 million in 2006 as a result of redeeming 125 million of preferred units in 2005 preferred stock dividends increased 29 million to 197 million in 2006 as a result of the issuance of 75 million of preferred stock in 2005 

net income for common stockholders increased 529 million to 1988 million in 2006 as compared with 1459 million in 2005 primarily related to increases in revenues described above and higher gains recognized from sale of real estate diluted earnings per share was 289 in 2006 as compared to 223 in 2005 or 30 higher 

comparison of the years ended december 31 2005 to 2004

our revenues increased by 23 million or 6 to 3806 million in 2005 as summarized in the following table in thousands 

 

 the increase in revenues was primarily related to higher minimum rent from growth in rental rates from renewing expiring leases or releasing vacant space in the operating properties and from new minimum rent generated from recently completed developments commencing operations in the current year in addition to collecting minimum rent from our tenants we also collect percentage rent based upon their sales volumes during 2005 increased tenant sales volumes resulted in a 17 increase in our percentage rent recoveries from tenants represents reimbursements from tenants for their prorata share of the operating maintenance and real estate tax expenses that we incur to operate our shopping centers

 as a result of mcwr ii acquiring the first washington portfolio on june 1 2005 we recorded 138 million in fees related to investment and financing services that we provided to mcwr ii mcwr ii paid us approximately 212 million for these services however the amount recognized as fee income includes only that portion of fees paid by the venture not owned by us we managed the first washington portfolio for a period of seven months during 2005 and received property management fees from mcwr ii which accounted for the majority of the increase in property management fees above 2004 we also received higher property management and asset management fees from our other joint ventures during 2005 related to acquisitions that they completed during 2004 and 2005 

  

our equity in income of real estate partnerships joint ventures declined 131 million to a loss of 29 million in 2005 as follows in thousands 

 

 the loss was a result of the significant amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded by mcwr ii related to its acquisition of the first washington portfolio on june 1 2005 excluding the depreciation and amortization mcwr ii produced positive cash flow from operations during the period 

our operating expenses increased by 101 million or 5 to 2056 million in 2005 related to increased operating and maintenance costs general and administrative costs and depreciation expense as further described below the following table summarizes our operating expenses in thousands 

 

 the increase in operating maintenance and real estate taxes was primarily due to shopping center developments that were recently completed and did not incur operating expenses for a full 12 months during the previous year and to general price increases incurred by the operating properties on average approximately 80 of these costs are recovered from our tenants as expense reimbursements and included in our revenues 

the increase in general and administrative expense is related to additional salary costs for new employees necessary to manage the first washington portfolio under a property management agreement with mcwr ii and higher stock based compensation expenses associated with the early adoption of statement 123r which requires the expensing of stock options during 2005 we recorded compensation expense associated with stock options of 14 million 

the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily related to new development properties recently completed and placed in service in the current year or if placed in service in the previous year were not operational for a full 12 months 

the reduction in other expenses pertains to a decline in the income tax provision of rrg from 65 million in 2004 to 493709 in 2005 

our interest expense net of interest capitalization increased 68 million to 865 million in 2005 

  

from 797 million in 2004 primarily related to the financing of our investment in mcwr ii during 2005 we capitalized interest of 124 million as compared to 112 million in 2004 interest incurred that is directly related to the construction of new shopping centers is capitalized into properties under development on june 1 2005 we borrowed 275 million on the bridge loan and 122 million on the line to fund our investment during july and august we repaid the bridge loan and reduced the line using a portion of the proceeds from the 200 million forward sale agreement a 75 million preferred stock offering and the issuance of 350 million of 548 fixed rate debt average interest rates on our outstanding debt increased to 634 at december 31 2005 compared to 624 at december 31 2004 our weighted average outstanding debt at december 31 2005 was 16 billion compared to 15 billion at december 31 2004 

gains from the sale of operating properties and properties in development were 190 million in 2005 as compared to 394 million in 2004 included in 2005 are gains of 87 million from the sale of 26 outparcels for net proceeds of 290 million and gains of 103 million related to the sale of three development properties and one operating property included in 2004 are gains of 189 million from the sale of 41 outparcels for net proceeds of 604 million and gains of 205 million from shopping centers sold these gains are included in continuing operations rather than discontinued operations because they were either properties that had no operating income or they were properties sold to joint ventures where we have continuing involvement through our equity investment 

we review our real estate portfolio for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of an asset we determine whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property’s carrying value to an estimate of fair value based upon methods described in our critical accounting policies in the event a property is impaired we write down the asset to fair value for “heldandused” assets and to fair value less costs to sell for “heldfor sale” assets during 2005 and 2004 we established provisions for loss of 550000 and 810000 respectively to adjust operating properties to their estimated fair values the provision for loss on properties subsequently sold to third parties is included in operating income from discontinued operations 

income from discontinued operations was 655 million in 2005 related to 14 properties sold to unrelated parties for net proceeds of 1752 million and four properties classified as heldforsale income from discontinued operations was 369 million in 2004 related to the operations of shopping centers sold or classified as heldforsale in 2005 and 2004 in compliance with statement 144 if we sell an asset in the current year we are required to reclassify its operating income into discontinued operations for all prior periods this practice results in a reclassification of amounts previously reported as continuing operations into discontinued operations our income from discontinued operations is shown net of minority interest of exchangeable partnership units totaling 13 million and 699059 and income taxes totaling 36 million and 23 million for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively 

minority interest of preferred units declined 117 million to 81 million in 2005 as a result of redeeming 54 million of preferred units in 2005 and redeeming 125 million of preferred units in 2004 preferred stock dividends increased 81 million to 167 million in 2005 as a result of the issuance of 75 million of preferred stock in 2005 and 125 million of preferred stock in 2004 

net income for common stockholders increased 182 million to 1459 million in 2005 as compared with 1277 million in 2004 diluted earnings per share were 223 in 2005 compared with 208 in 2004 or 7 higher a result of the increase in net income 

environmental matters 

we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers and underground petroleum storage tanks ust’s we believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and 

  

regulations generally we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to nonchlorinated solvent systems where available we have applied and been accepted into statesponsored environmental programs we have a blanket environmental insurance policy that covers us against thirdparty liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination we have also placed environmental insurance where possible on specific properties with known contamination in order to mitigate our environmental risk we monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites we also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so we estimate the cost associated with these legal obligations to be approximately 38 million all of which has been reserved we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material affect on our financial position liquidity or operations however we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies with respect to our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities that any previous owner occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants by the condition of nearby properties or by unrelated third parties or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us 

inflation 

inflation has remained relatively low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers however substantially all of our longterm leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation such provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rent based on tenants’ gross sales which generally increase as prices rise andor escalation clauses which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices in addition many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years which permits us to seek increased rents upon rerental at market rates most of our leases require tenants to pay their prorata share of operating expenses including commonarea maintenance real estate taxes insurance and utilities thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk 

we are exposed to interestrate changes primarily related to the variable interest rate on the line and the refinancing of longterm debt which currently contain fixed interest rates the objective of our interestrate risk management is to limit the impact of interestrate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we borrow primarily at fixed interest rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interestrate swaps caps or treasury locks in order to mitigate our interestrate risk on a related financial instrument we do not enter into derivative or interestrate transactions for speculative purposes 

our interestrate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the table below presents the principal cash flows in thousands weighted average interest rates of remaining debt and the fair value of total debt in thousands as of december 31 2006 by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interestrate changes 

 

 we currently have 4347 million of fixed rate debt maturing in 2010 and 2011 on march 10 2006 the company entered into four forwardstarting interest rate swaps totaling 3967 million with fixed rates of 5399 5415 5399 and 5415 the company designated these swaps as cash flow hedges to fix 400 million of fixed rate financing expected to occur in 2010 and 2011 the proceeds of which will be used to repay debt maturing in those years the change in fair value of these swaps from inception has generated a liability of 29 million at december 31 2006 which is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2006 it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date moreover because firm commitments are not presented in the table above the information presented above has limited predictive value as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interestrate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at that time and actual interest rates

 item 1 business 

regency is a qualified real estate investment trust “reit” which began operations in 1993 our primary operating and investment goal is longterm growth in earnings per share and total shareholder return which we hope to achieve by focusing on a strategy of owning operating and developing highquality community and neighborhood shopping centers that are tenanted by marketdominant grocers categoryleading anchors specialty retailers and restaurants located in areas with above average household incomes and population densities we own manage lease acquire and develop shopping centers through our operating partnership regency centers lp “rclp” in which we currently own approximately 98 of the outstanding operating partnership units regency’s operating investing and financing activities are generally performed by rclp its wholly owned subsidiaries and its joint ventures with third parties 

currently we operate and manage a real estate investment portfolio that totals 73 billion at cost before depreciation with 393 shopping centers in 27 states and the district of columbia including approximately 41 billion in real estate assets composed of 180 shopping centers owned by unconsolidated joint ventures in 23 states and the district of columbia portfolio information is presented a on a combined basis including unconsolidated joint ventures “combined basis” b on a basis that excludes the unconsolidated joint ventures “consolidated properties” and c on a basis that includes only the unconsolidated joint ventures “unconsolidated properties” we believe that providing our shopping center portfolio information under these methods provides a more complete understanding of the properties that we own including those that we partially own and for which we provide property and asset management services at december 31 2005 our gross leasable area “gla” on a combined basis totaled 462 million square feet and was 913 leased the portfolio contains 508 million square feet when anchored owned buildings are included the gla for the 213 consolidated properties totaled 244 million square feet and was 880 leased including shopping centers under construction and partially preleased the gla for the unconsolidated properties totaled 218 million square feet and was 951 leased 

we earn revenues and generate operating cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to marketleading grocers and major retail anchors as well as specialty sideshop retailers restaurants and outparcel tenants in our shopping centers we experience growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates at currently owned shopping centers and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers community and neighborhood shopping centers generate substantial daily traffic by conveniently offering daily necessities and services this high traffic generates increased sales thereby driving higher occupancy rental rates and rentalrate growth for regency which we expect to sustain our growth in earnings per share and increase the value of our portfolio over the long term 

we seek a range of strong national regional and local specialty retailers for the same reason that we choose to anchor our centers with leading grocers and major retailers we have created a formal partnering process — the premier customer initiative “pci” — to promote mutually beneficial relationships with our specialty retailers the objective of pci is for regency to build a base of specialty tenants who represent the “bestinclass” operators in their respective merchandising categories such retailers reinforce the consumer appeal and other strengths of a center’s anchor help to stabilize a center’s occupancy reduce releasing downtime reduce tenant turnover and yield higher sustainable rents 

  

index to financial statements we grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions and new shopping center development where we acquire the land and construct the building development is customer driven meaning we generally have an executed lease from the anchor before we start construction developments serve the growth needs of our anchors and specialty retailers resulting in modern shopping centers with longterm anchor leases that produce attractive returns on our invested capital this development process can require up to 36 months or longer from initial land or redevelopment acquisition through construction leaseup and stabilization of rental income depending upon the size of the project generally anchor tenants begin operating their stores prior to the completion of construction of the entire center resulting in rental income during the development phase 

we intend to maintain a conservative capital structure to fund our growth programs which should preserve our investmentgrade ratings our approach is founded on our selffunding business model this model utilizes center “recycling” as a key component which requires ongoing monitoring of each center to ensure that it meets our stringent quality standards properties that do not measure up to our standards are sold in combination with noncore development sales these sale proceeds are redeployed into new higherquality developments and acquisitions that are expected to generate sustainable revenue growth and more attractive returns 

joint venturing of shopping centers also provides us with a capital source for new development as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset and property management services as asset manager we are engaged by our partners to apply similar operating investment and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the joint ventures joint ventures grow their shopping center investments through acquisitions from third parties or direct purchases from regency although selling properties to joint ventures reduces our ownership interest we continue to share in the risks and rewards of centers that meet our high quality standards and longterm investment strategy we have no obligations or liabilities of the joint ventures beyond our ownership interest percentage 

there are many challenges affecting our industry and we are addressing them accordingly an economic downturn could result in declines in occupancy levels at our shopping centers which would reduce our rental revenues however we believe that our investment focus on grocery and discount target and walmart anchored shopping centers that conveniently provide daily necessities will minimize the impact of a downturn in the economy the grocery anchor environment is changing constantly and increased competition from supercenters such as walmart and industry consolidation could result in grocery store closings we closely monitor the operating performance and tenants’s sales in our shopping centers that operate near supercenters as well as those tenants operating retail formats that are experiencing significant changes in competition or business practice such as the video rental format a slowdown in the demand for new shopping centers could cause a corresponding reduction in our shopping center development program and likely reduce our future operating revenues and gains from development sales we believe that the presence of our development teams in key markets and their excellent relationships with leading anchor tenants will enable us to sustain our development program 

competition 

we are among the largest publiclyheld owners of shopping centers in the nation based on revenues number of properties gross leaseable area and market capitalization there are numerous companies and private individuals engaged in the ownership development acquisition and operation of shopping centers which compete with us in our targeted markets this results in competition for attracting anchor tenants as well as the acquisition of existing shopping centers and new development sites we believe that the principal competitive factors in attracting tenants in our market areas are location demographics rental costs tenant mix property age and maintenance we believe that our competitive advantages include our locations within our market areas the design quality of our shopping centers the strong demographics surrounding our shopping centers our relationships with our anchor tenants and our sideshop and outparcel retailers our pci program which allows us to provide retailers with multiple locations our practice of maintaining and renovating our shopping centers and our ability to source and develop new shopping centers 

changes in policies 

our board of directors establishes the policies that govern our investment and operating strategies including among others development and acquisition of shopping centers tenant and market focus debt and equity financing policies quarterly distributions to stockholders and reit tax status the board of directors may amend these policies at any time without a vote of our stockholders 

employees 

our headquarters are located at 121 west forsyth street suite 200 jacksonville florida we presently maintain 20 market offices nationwide where we conduct management leasing construction and investment activities at december 31 2005 we had 457 employees and we believe that our relations with our employees are good 

compliance with governmental regulations 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate certain hazardous or toxic substances at our shopping centers these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances the cost of required remediation and the owner’s liability for remediation could exceed the value of the property andor the aggregate assets of the owner the presence of such substances or the failure to properly 

  

index to financial statements remediate such substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent the property or borrow using the property as collateral we have a number of properties that could require or are currently undergoing varying levels of environmental remediation environmental remediation is not currently expected to have a material financial effect on us due to reserves for remediation insurance programs designed to mitigate the cost of remediation and various stateregulated programs that shift the responsibility and cost to the state 

executive officers 

the executive officers of the company are appointed each year by the board of directors each of the executive officers has been employed by the company in the position or positions indicated in the list and pertinent notes below each of the executive officers has been employed by the company for more than five years

 item 1a risk factors 

risk factors related to our industry and real estate investments 

our revenues and cash flow could be adversely affected by poor market conditions where properties are geographically concentrated 

regency’s performance depends on the economic conditions in markets in which our properties are concentrated during the year ended december 31 2005 our properties in california florida and texas accounted for 522 of our base rent our revenues and cash available for distribution to stockholders could be adversely affected by this geographic concentration if market conditions in these areas such as an oversupply of retail space or a reduction in the demand for shopping centers become more competitive relative to other geographic areas 

loss of revenues from major tenants could reduce distributions to stockholders 

we derive significant revenues from anchor tenants such as kroger publix and safeway that occupy more than one center distributions to stockholders could be adversely affected by the loss of revenues in the event a major tenant 

 

   

index to financial statements   

  

  

 vacated anchor space including space owned by the anchor can reduce rental revenues generated by the shopping center because of the loss of the departed anchor tenant’s customer drawing power most anchors have the right to vacate and prevent retenanting by paying rent for the balance of the lease term if major tenants vacate a property then other tenants may be entitled to terminate their leases at the property 

downturns in the retailing industry likely will have a direct adverse impact on our revenues and cash flow 

our properties consist primarily of groceryanchored shopping centers our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space the market for retail space has been or could be adversely affected by any of the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 to the extent that any of these conditions occur they are likely to impact market rents for retail space and our cash available for distribution to stockholders 

unsuccessful development activities could reduce distributions to stockholders 

we actively pursue development activities as opportunities arise development activities require various government and other approvals we may not recover our investment in development projects for which approvals are not received we incur other risks associated with development activities including 

 

   

index to financial statements   

  

 if we sustain material losses due to an unsuccessful development project our cash flow available for distribution to stockholders will be reduced 

we may encounter difficulties in assimilating the first washington portfolio 

in june 2005 we acquired a 100property portfolio from a joint venture between the california public employees retirement system and first washington realty inc although we currently own 2495 of the portfolio through a joint venture we will be responsible for managing the entire portfolio once first washington ends its transitional management and leasing services the purchase agreement did not require us to acquire any first washington offices personnel or other infrastructure we may encounter difficulties in integrating such a large portfolio with our existing systems and personnel which could result in additional expense and adversely affect our results of operations 

uninsured loss may adversely affect distributions to stockholders 

we carry comprehensive liability fire flood extended coverage rental loss and environmental insurance for our properties with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties we believe that the insurance carried on our properties is adequate in accordance with industry standards there are however some types of losses such as from hurricanes terrorism wars or earthquakes which may be uninsurable or the cost of insuring against such losses may not be economically justifiable if an uninsured loss occurs we could lose both the invested capital in and anticipated revenues from the property but we would still be obligated to repay any recourse mortgage debt on the property in that event our distributions to stockholders could be reduced 

we face competition from numerous sources 

the ownership of shopping centers is highly fragmented with less than 10 owned by real estate investment trusts we face competition from other real estate investment trusts as well as from numerous small owners in the acquisition ownership and leasing of shopping centers we compete to develop shopping centers with other real estate investment trusts engaged in development activities as well as with local regional and national real estate developers 

we compete in the acquisition of properties through proprietary research that identifies opportunities in markets with high barriers to entry and higherthanaverage population growth and household income we seek to maximize rents per square foot by establishing relationships with supermarket chains that are first or second in their markets and leasing nonanchor space in multiple centers to national or regional tenants we compete to develop properties by applying our proprietary research methods to identify development and leasing opportunities and by preleasing a significant portion of a center before beginning construction 

there can be no assurance however that other real estate owners or developers will not utilize similar research methods and target the same markets and anchor tenants that we target these entities may successfully control these markets and tenants to our exclusion if we cannot successfully compete in our targeted markets our cash flow and therefore distributions to stockholders may be adversely affected 

costs of environmental remediation could reduce our cash flow available for distribution to stockholders 

under various federal state and local laws an owner or manager of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on the property these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances the cost of any required remediation could exceed the value of the property andor the aggregate assets of the owner 

  

index to financial statements our principal environmental risk is from dry cleaning plants that currently operate or have operated in the past at our shopping centers the presence of or the failure to properly remediate hazardous or toxic substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent a contaminated property or to borrow using the property as collateral any of these developments could reduce cash flow and distributions to stockholders 

risk factors related to our acquisition structure 

we do not have voting control over our joint venture investments so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued 

we have invested as a coventurer in the acquisition or development of properties as of december 31 2005 our investments in real estate partnerships represented 15 of our total assets these investments involve risks not present in a whollyowned project we do not have voting control over the ventures the coventurer might 1 have interests or goals that are inconsistent with our interests or goals or 2 otherwise impede our objectives the coventurer also might become insolvent or bankrupt 

our partnership structure may limit our flexibility to manage our assets 

we invest in retail shopping centers through regency centers lp the operating partnership in which we currently own 98 of the outstanding common partnership units from time to time we acquire properties through our operating partnership in exchange for limited partnership interests this acquisition structure may permit limited partners who contribute properties to us to defer some if not all of the income tax liability that they would incur if they sold the property 

properties contributed to our operating partnership may have unrealized gain attributable to the difference between the fair market value and adjusted tax basis in the properties prior to contribution as a result the sale of these properties could cause adverse tax consequences to the limited partners who contributed them 

generally our operating partnership has no obligation to consider the tax consequences of its actions to any limited partner however our operating partnership may acquire properties in the future subject to material restrictions on refinancing or resale designed to minimize the adverse tax consequences to the limited partners who contribute those properties these restrictions could significantly reduce our flexibility to manage our assets by preventing us from reducing mortgage debt or selling a property when such a transaction might be in our best interest in order to reduce interest costs or dispose of an underperforming property 

risk factors related to our capital structure 

our debt financing may reduce distributions to stockholders 

we do not expect to generate sufficient funds from operations to make balloon principal payments when due on our debt if we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms we might be forced 1 to dispose of properties which might result in losses or 2 to obtain financing at unfavorable terms either could reduce the cash flow available for distributions to stockholders 

in addition if we cannot make required mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose on the property securing the mortgage causing the loss of cash flow from that property furthermore substantially all of our debt is crossdefaulted which means that a default under one loan could trigger defaults under other loans 

on june 1 2005 we incurred 275 million of additional debt to complete the funding of our portion of the joint venture that acquired the first washington portfolio as a result our debttoequity ratio and the ratio of our debttototal assets have increased our lenders modified our line of credit to increase our debttoassets leverage ratio from 055 to 100 to 060 to 100 the line of credit has also been modified to impose limitations on the amount of recourse indebtedness that can be incurred by our unconsolidated affiliates we intend to reduce our debt ratios through our capital recycling program in which we sell properties that no longer meet our longterm investment criteria however there can be no assurance that we will be able to reduce our debt ratios in accordance with our plan we could be required to seek an extension for our line of credit modification with our lenders and a failure to do so could result in an event of default in addition the rating agencies could decide to lower our debt ratings which would increase our borrowing costs and could make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on acceptable terms 

  

index to financial statements our organizational documents do not limit the amount of debt that may be incurred the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences including the following 

 

  

  

 we depend on external sources of capital which may not be available in the future 

to qualify as a reit we must among other things distribute to our stockholders each year at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding any net capital gains because of these distribution requirements we likely will not be able to fund all future capital needs including capital for acquisitions with income from operations we therefore will have to rely on thirdparty sources of capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all our access to thirdparty sources of capital depends on a number of things including the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings in addition our line of credit imposes covenants that limit our flexibility in obtaining other financing such as a prohibition on negative pledge agreements 

additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders’ interests and additional debt financing may substantially increase our degree of leverage 

risk factors related to interest rates and the market for our stock 

increased interest rates may reduce distributions to stockholders 

we are obligated on floating rate debt and if we do not eliminate our exposure to increases in interest rates through interest rate protection or cap agreements these increases may reduce cash flow and our ability to make distributions to stockholders 

although swap agreements enable us to convert floating rate debt to fixed rate debt and cap agreements enable us to cap our maximum interest rate they expose us to the risk that the counterparties to these hedge agreements may not perform which could increase our exposure to rising interest rates if we enter into swap agreements decreases in interest rates will increase our interest expense as compared to the underlying floating rate debt this could result in our making payments to unwind these agreements such as in connection with a prepayment of the floating rate debt cap agreements do not protect us from increases up to the capped rate 

increased market interest rates could reduce our stock prices 

the annual dividend rate on our common stock as a percentage of its market price may influence the trading price of our stock an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers to demand a higher annual dividend rate which could adversely affect the market price of our stock a decrease in the market price of our common stock could reduce our ability to raise additional equity in the public markets 

outstanding syndecs could adversely influence the market price for our common stock 

in june 2003 citigroup global markets holdings inc or cgmhi sold an aggregate of 8280000 syndecs debt exchangeable for common stock the syndecs are a series of debt securities of cgmhi that will each be mandatorily exchanged upon maturity on july 1 2006 into our common stock or its value in cash based on a formula linked to the market price of our common stock any market for the syndecs is likely to influence the market for our common stock for example the price of our common stock could become more volatile and could be depressed by investors’ anticipation of the potential distribution into the market of substantial additional amounts of our common stock at the maturity of the syndecs by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the syndecs as a more attractive means of equity participation in regency and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving the syndecs and our common stock 

  

index to financial statements risk factors related to federal income tax laws 

if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 

we believe that we qualify for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes and we plan to operate so that we can continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit if we qualify as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on our income that we distribute currently to our stockholders many of the reit requirements however are highly technical and complex the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances some of which may not be totally within our control and some of which involve questions of interpretation for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income must come from specific passive sources like rent that are itemized in the reit tax laws there can be no assurance that the irs or a court would agree with the positions we have taken in interpreting the reit requirements we also are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains the fact that we hold some of our assets through joint ventures and their subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status furthermore congress and the internal revenue service might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult or impossible for us to remain qualified as a reit 

also unless the irs granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we would remain disqualified as a reit for four years following the year we first failed to qualify if we failed to qualify as a reit we would have to pay significant income taxes this likely would have a significant adverse affect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to pay any dividends to stockholders 

even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we are required to pay certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from “prohibited transactions” that income will be subject to a 100 tax in general prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business the determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale while we have undertaken a significant number of asset sales in recent years we do not believe that those sales should be considered prohibited transactions but there can be no assurance that the irs would not contend otherwise 

in addition any net taxable income earned directly by our taxable affiliates including regency realty group inc is subject to federal and state corporate income tax several provisions of the laws applicable to reits and their subsidiaries ensure that a taxable reit subsidiary will be subject to an appropriate level of federal income taxation for example a taxable reit subsidiary is limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to an affiliated reit in addition a reit has to pay a 100 penalty tax on some payments that it receives if the economic arrangements between the reit the reit’s tenants and the taxable reit subsidiary are not comparable to similar arrangements between unrelated parties finally some state and local jurisdictions may tax some of our income even though as a reit we are not subject to federal income tax on that income to the extent that we and our affiliates are required to pay federal state and local taxes we will have less cash available for distributions to our stockholders 

a reit may not own securities in any one issuer if the value of those securities exceeds 5 of the value of the reit’s total assets or the securities owned by the reit represent more than 10 of the issuer’s outstanding voting securities or 10 of the value of the issuer’s outstanding securities an exception to these tests allows a reit to own securities of a subsidiary that exceed the 5 value test and the 10 value tests if the subsidiary elects to be a “taxable reit subsidiary” we are not able to own securities of taxable reit subsidiaries that represent in the aggregate more than 20 of the value of our total assets we currently own more than 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of regency realty group inc which has elected to be a taxable reit subsidiary 

risk factors related to our ownership limitations the florida business corporation act and certain other matters 

restrictions on the ownership of our capital stock to preserve our reit status could delay or prevent a change in control 

ownership of more than 7 by value of our outstanding capital stock by certain persons is restricted for the purpose of maintaining our qualification as a reit with certain exceptions this 7 limitation may discourage a 

  

index to financial statements change in control and may also i deter tender offers for our capital stock which offers may be attractive to our stockholders or ii limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their capital stock that might otherwise exist if an investor attempted to assemble a block in excess of 7 of our outstanding capital stock or to effect a change in control 

the issuance of our capital stock could delay or prevent a change in control 

our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to 30000000 shares of preferred stock and 10000000 shares of special common stock and to establish the preferences and rights of any shares issued the issuance of preferred stock or special common stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control even if a change in control were in our stockholders’ interest the provisions of the florida business corporation act regarding control share acquisitions and affiliated transactions could also deter potential acquisitions by preventing the acquiring party from voting the common stock it acquires or consummating a merger or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of our disinterested stockholders

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview and operating philosophy 

regency is a qualified real estate investment trust “reit” which began operations in 1993 our primary operating and investment goal is longterm growth in earnings per share and total shareholder return which we hope to achieve by focusing on a strategy of owning operating and developing highquality community and neighborhood shopping centers that are tenanted by marketdominant grocers categoryleading anchors specialty retailers and restaurants located in areas with above average household incomes and population densities we own manage lease acquire and develop shopping centers through our operating partnership regency centers lp “rclp” in which we currently own approximately 98 of the outstanding operating partnership units regency’s operating investing and financing activities are generally performed by rclp its wholly owned subsidiaries and its joint ventures with third parties 

currently we operate and manage a real estate investment portfolio that totals 73 billion at cost before depreciation with 393 shopping centers in 27 states and the district of columbia including approximately 41 billion in real estate assets composed of 180 shopping centers owned by unconsolidated joint ventures in 23 states and the district of columbia portfolio information is presented a on a combined basis including unconsolidated joint ventures “combined basis” b on a basis that excludes the unconsolidated joint ventures “consolidated properties” and c on a basis that includes only the unconsolidated joint ventures “unconsolidated properties” we believe that providing our shopping center portfolio information under these methods provides a more complete understanding of the properties that we own including those that we partially own and for which we provide property and asset management services at december 31 2005 our gross leasable area “gla” on a combined basis totaled 462 million square feet and was 913 leased the portfolio contains 508 million square feet when anchored owned buildings are included the gla for the 213 consolidated properties totaled 244 million square feet and was 880 leased including shopping centers under construction and partially preleased the gla for the unconsolidated properties totaled 218 million square feet and was 951 leased 

we earn revenues and generate operating cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to marketleading grocers and major retail anchors as well as specialty sideshop retailers restaurants and outparcel tenants in our shopping centers we experience growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates at currently owned shopping centers and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers community and neighborhood shopping centers generate substantial daily traffic by conveniently offering daily necessities and services this high traffic generates increased sales thereby driving higher occupancy rental rates and rentalrate growth for regency which we expect to sustain our growth in earnings per share and increase the value of our portfolio over the long term 

we seek a range of strong national regional and local specialty retailers for the same reason that we choose to anchor our centers with leading grocers and major retailers we have created a formal partnering process—the premier customer initiative “pci” — to promote mutually beneficial relationships with our specialty retailers the objective of pci is for regency to build a base of specialty tenants who represent the “bestinclass” operators in their respective merchandising categories such retailers reinforce the consumer appeal and other strengths of a center’s anchor help to stabilize a center’s occupancy reduce releasing downtime reduce tenant turnover and yield higher sustainable rents 

we grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions and new shopping center development where we acquire the land and construct the building development is customer driven meaning we generally have an executed lease from the anchor before we start construction developments serve the growth needs of our anchors and specialty retailers resulting in modern shopping centers with longterm anchor leases that produce attractive returns on our invested capital this development process can require up to 36 months or longer from initial land or redevelopment acquisition through construction leaseup and stabilization of rental income depending upon the size of the project generally anchor tenants begin operating their stores prior to the completion of construction of the entire center resulting in rental income during the development phase 

  

index to financial statements we intend to maintain a conservative capital structure to fund our growth programs which should preserve our investmentgrade ratings our approach is founded on our selffunding business model this model utilizes center “recycling” as a key component which requires ongoing monitoring of each center to ensure that it meets our stringent quality standards properties that do not measure up to our standards are sold in combination with noncore development sales these sale proceeds are redeployed into new higherquality developments and acquisitions that are expected to generate sustainable revenue growth and more attractive returns 

joint venturing of shopping centers also provides us with a capital source for new development as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset and property management services as asset manager we are engaged by our partners to apply similar operating investment and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the joint ventures joint ventures grow their shopping center investments through acquisitions from third parties or direct purchases from regency although selling properties to joint ventures reduces our ownership interest we continue to share in the risks and rewards of centers that meet our high quality standards and longterm investment strategy we have no obligations or liabilities of the joint ventures beyond our ownership interest percentage 

we have identified certain significant risks and challenges affecting our industry and we are addressing them accordingly an economic downturn could result in declines in occupancy levels at our shopping centers which would reduce our rental revenues however we believe that our investment focus on grocery and discount target and walmart anchored shopping centers that conveniently provide daily necessities will minimize the impact of a downturn in the economy increased competition from supercenters such as walmart and industry consolidation could result in grocery store closings we closely monitor the operating performance and tenants’ sales in our shopping centers that operate near supercenters as well as those tenants operating retail formats that are experiencing significant changes in competition or business practice such as the video rental format a slowdown in the demand for new shopping centers could cause a corresponding reduction in our shopping center development program and likely reduce our future operating revenues and gains from development sales we believe that the presence of our development teams in key markets and their excellent relationships with leading anchor tenants will enable us to sustain our development program 

shopping center portfolio 

the following tables summarize general operating statistics related to our shopping center portfolio which we use to evaluate and monitor our performance the portfolio information below is presented a on a combined basis b for consolidated properties and c for unconsolidated properties the definitions of which are provided above 

 

   

index to financial statements we seek to reduce our operating and leasing risks through diversification which we achieve by geographically diversifying our shopping centers avoiding dependence on any single property market or tenant and owning a portion of our shopping centers through joint ventures

    liquidity and capital resources 

general 

we expect that cash generated from revenues including gains from the sale of real estate will provide the necessary funds on a shortterm basis to pay our operating expenses interest expense scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness capital expenditures necessary to maintain and improve our shopping centers and dividends to stockholders net cash provided by operating activities was 2082 million 1839 million and 1806 million for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively operating cash flow increased 132 during 2005 primarily as a result of a 193 increase in net income as described below under results of operations for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 our gains from the sale of real estate were 767 million 605 million and 659 million the details of which are discussed below under shopping center developments acquisitions and sales we incurred capital expenditures of 144 million 117 million and 135 million to improve our shopping centers we paid scheduled principal payments of 55 million 57 million and 41 million to our lenders on mortgage loans and we paid dividends of 1701 million 1572 million and 1579 million to our stockholders respectively the increase in dividends of 82 during 2005 was primarily related to a 200 million equity offering as described below under equity capital transactions  

although base rent is supported by longterm lease contracts tenants who file bankruptcy are able to cancel their leases and close the related stores in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues on february 21 2005 winndixie stores inc filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code we currently lease three stores to winndixie two of which are owned directly by us and one is owned in a joint venture our annualized base rent from winndixie including our share of the joint venture is 12 million winndixie currently owes regency 34750 in prepetition rent related to common area expense reimbursements and is current on all rent postpetition we are not aware at this time of the current or pending bankruptcy of any of our other tenants that would cause a significant reduction in our revenues and no tenant represents more than 7 of the total of our annual base rental revenues and our prorata share of the base revenues of the unconsolidated properties 

  

index to financial statements we expect to meet longterm capital requirements for redeemable preferred stock and units maturing debt the acquisition of real estate investments in joint ventures and the renovation or development of shopping centers from i residual cash generated from operating activities after the payments described above ii proceeds from the sale of real estate iii joint venturing of real estate iv refinancing of debt or our line of credit and v equity raised in the private or public markets at december 31 2005 we had 1236 million available for equity securities under our shelf registration and rclp had 6000 million available for debt under its shelf registration 

we intend to continue to grow our portfolio through new developments and acquisitions either directly or through our joint venture relationships because development and acquisition activities are discretionary in nature they are not expected to burden the capital resources we have currently available for liquidity requirements capital necessary to complete developmentsinprocess will be funded from our line of credit and our capital recycling program as previously described we expect that cash provided by operating activities proceeds from the sale of real estate unused amounts available under our line of credit and cash reserves are adequate to meet shortterm and committed longterm liquidity requirements 

shopping center developments acquisitions and sales 

on a consolidated basis we had 30 projects under construction or undergoing major renovations at december 31 2005 which when completed will represent an investment of 7789 million before the estimated reimbursement of certain tenantrelated costs and projected sales proceeds from adjacent land and outparcels of 819 million we estimate that we will earn an average return on our investment on these projects of 97 upon completion this average return on investment is approximately 50 to 75 basis points less than our experience in prior years and is the result of higher costs associated with the acquisition of land and construction while the average return on investment has decreased from historical experience the company believes the return on a risk adjusted basis is very adequate because expected profit margins are well in excess of historic margins costs necessary to complete the current in process developments are estimated to be 4757 million and will likely be expended through 2009 the costs to complete these developments will be funded from the company’s unsecured line of credit which had 3380 million of available funding at december 31 2005 and also from expected proceeds from the future sale of shopping centers as part of the capital recycling program described above our expected total investment in new developments increased 167 at december 31 2005 at december 31 2004 we had 32 consolidated projects under construction representing an investment at completion of 6825 million our estimated return on investment for the projects under construction at the end of 2004 was 102 we expect to continue increasing our development pipeline in the future subject to the ongoing demand for new retail space by our retail customers 

during 2005 the company sold 100 of its interest in 14 properties for net proceeds of 1752 million the operating income and gains from these properties and properties classified as held for sale are included in discontinued operations the revenues from properties included in discontinued operations were 194 million 309 million and 404 million for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively

recognition of gains from sales to joint ventures is recorded on only that portion of the sales not attributable to our ownership interest the gains and operations are not recorded as discontinued operations because of our continuing involvement in these shopping centers columbia regcal and the joint ventures with mcw intend to continue to acquire retail shopping centers some of which they may acquire directly from us for those properties acquired from unrelated parties we are required to contribute our prorata share of the purchase price to the partnerships 

on june 1 2005 regency entered into a credit agreement that provided for a 275 million unsecured term loan maturing on march 1 2006 the “bridge loan” which was fully repaid on august 1 2005 using proceeds from the sale of common stock and the issuance of fixed rate debt described below the bridge loan was used to provide partial financing necessary for regency’s 35 equity investment of 397 million in mcwr ii which closed on june 1 2005 our remaining equity investment was funded from the line of credit the interest rate was a floating rate of libor plus 65 basis points which was subject to adjustment based on the credit ratings assigned by regency’s rating agencies with interest only paid monthly 

on april 5 2005 we entered into a forward stock purchase contract with an affiliate of citigroup global markets inc “citigroup” pursuant to which we agreed to issue 43 million of regency’s common shares and citigroup agreed to purchase the shares for 4660 per share the “forward sale agreement” on august 1 2005 we completed the sale of 38 million shares to citigroup and received proceeds of 1755 million the proceeds were used to redeem the series e preferred units reduce our line of credit and repay the balance of the bridge loan on september 7 2005 the remaining 530000 shares under the forward sale agreement were settled for 244 million and the net proceeds were used to redeem the series f preferred units 

  

index to financial statements shopping center acquisitions sales and the net acquisitions or sales activities within our investments in real estate partnerships are included in investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows net cash used in investing activities was 4848 million 383 million and 490 million for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the significant increase in net cash used in investing activities of 4465 million was primarily related to our investment in mcwr ii and an increase in the number of projects under development as described previously 

contractual obligations 

we have debt obligations related to our mortgage loans unsecured notes and our unsecured line of credit as described further below we have shopping centers that are subject to noncancelable longterm ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to us to construct andor operate a shopping center in addition we have noncancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from which we conduct our business the table excludes obligations for approximately 27 million related to environmental remediation as discussed below under environmental matters as the timing of the remediation is not currently known and also excludes obligations related to construction contracts where payment is only due upon performance by the contractor the following table summarizes our debt maturities including interest excluding recorded debt premiums that are not obligations and obligations under noncancelable operating leases as of december 31 2005 including our prorata share of obligations within unconsolidated joint ventures in thousands 

 

  

 outstanding debt at december 31 2005 and 2004 consists of the following in thousands 

 

   

index to financial statements mortgage loans are secured and may be prepaid but could be subject to yield maintenance premiums mortgage loans are generally due in monthly installments of interest and principal and mature over various terms through 2017 variable interest rates on mortgage loans are currently based on libor plus a spread in a range of 90 to 150 basis points fixed interest rates on mortgage loans range from 522 to 895 and average 661 

we have an unsecured revolving line of credit the “line” with a commitment of 500 million and the right to expand the line by an additional 150 million subject to additional lender syndication the balance of the line on december 31 2005 was 1620 million contractual interest rates on the line which are based on libor plus 75 were 5125 and 31875 at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively the spread that we pay on the line is dependent upon maintaining specific investmentgrade ratings we are also required to comply and are in compliance with certain financial covenants such as minimum net worth total liabilities to gross asset value “gav” secured indebtedness to gav and other covenants customary with this type of unsecured financing the line is used primarily to finance the development and acquisition of real estate but is also available for general workingcapital purposes 

on february 15 2005 we executed a commitment letter related to the line which temporarily modified certain line covenants related to our borrowing capacity and leverage in conjunction with the 275 million bridge loan as part of the first washington portfolio acquisition the bridge loan was fully repaid on august 1 2005 

the combined borrowings under the line of 122 million and the 275 million bridge loan provided the funding of our 397 million equity investment in mcwr ii on july 18 2005 we issued 350 million of unsecured notes the proceeds of which were used to reduce the bridge loan by 180 million to 95 million and reduce the line by approximately 170 million the notes bear interest at 525 and mature august 1 2015 on august 1 2005 we received proceeds of approximately 1755 million from the sale of common shares as further described below which were used to repay the bridge loan in full further reduce the balance of the line and redeem the series e preferred units 

as of december 31 2005 scheduled principal repayments on notes payable and the line were as follows in thousands 

 

 our investments in real estate partnerships had notes and mortgage loans payable of 24 billion at december 31 2005 which mature through 2028 our proportionate share of these loans was 7642 million of which 826 had average fixed interest rates of 508 and the remaining had variable interest rates based on libor plus a spread in a range of 75 to 100 basis points the loans are primarily nonrecourse but for those that are guaranteed by a joint venture our liability does not extend beyond our ownership percentage of the joint venture 

  

index to financial statements we are exposed to capital market risk such as changes in interest rates in order to manage the volatility related to interestrate risk we originate new debt with fixed interest rates or we consider entering into interestrate hedging arrangements we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes we account for derivative instruments under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended “statement 133” on april 1 2005 we entered into three forwardstarting interest rate swaps of approximately 656 million each with fixed rates of 5029 505 and 505 we designated the 1967 million swaps as cash flow hedges to fix the rate on unsecured notes issued during july 2005 the proceeds of which were used to reduce the line as described above we issued 350 million of unsecured notes priced to yield 525 on july 13 2005 we settled the swaps with a payment to the counterparties for 73 million which is recorded in other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of stockholder’s equity and comprehensive income loss the swap settlement is being amortized to interest expense as interest is incurred on the 350 million of tenyear unsecured notes sold july 18 2005 the effective interest rate on the notes including the amortization of the swap settlement amount is 548 

at december 31 2005 851 of our total debt had fixed interest rates compared with 820 at december 31 2004 we intend to limit the percentage of variable interestrate debt to be no more than 30 of total debt which we believe to be an acceptable risk at december 31 2005 our variable rate debt represented 149 of our total debt based upon the variable interestrate debt outstanding at december 31 2005 if variable interest rates were to increase by 1 our annual interest expense would increase by 24 million 

equity capital transactions 

from time to time we issue equity in the form of exchangeable operating partnership units or preferred units of rclp or in the form of common or preferred stock of regency centers corporation as previously discussed these sources of longterm equity financing allow us to fund our growth while maintaining a conservative capital structure the following describes our equity capital transactions during 2005 

preferred units 

we have issued preferred units in various amounts since 1998 the net proceeds of which we used to reduce the balance of the line we issue preferred units primarily to institutional investors in private placements generally the preferred units may be exchanged by the holders for cumulative redeemable preferred stock at an exchange rate of one share for one unit the preferred units and the related preferred stock are not convertible into regency common stock at december 31 2005 and 2004 the face value of total preferred units issued was 50 million and 104 million respectively with a weighted average fixed distribution rate of 745 and 813 respectively as of december 31 2005 only series d preferred units remained outstanding these units may be called by us in 2009 have no stated maturity or mandatory redemption and pay a cumulative quarterly dividend of 745 included in the series d preferred units are original issuance costs of 842023 that will be expensed when they are redeemed in the future 

on august 1 2005 we redeemed the 30 million series e preferred units and expensed their related issuance costs of 762180 the redemption was funded from the proceeds of the common stock sale completed august 1 2005 as discussed below under common stock on september 7 2005 we redeemed the 24 million series f preferred units and expensed their related issuance costs of 634201 this redemption was funded from the additional sale of common shares as further discussed below under common stock 

  

index to financial statements preferred stock 

at december 31 2005 we had three series of preferred stock outstanding  two of which underlie depositary shares held by the public the depositary shares each represent 110 th of a share of the underlying preferred stock and have a liquidation preference of 25 per depository share in 2003 we issued 745 series 3 cumulative redeemable preferred stock underlying 3 million depositary shares in 2004 we issued 725 series 4 cumulative redeemable preferred stock underlying 5 million depositary shares on august 2 2005 we issued 3 million shares or 75 million of 670 series 5 preferred stock with a liquidation preference of 25 per share the proceeds of which were used to reduce the balance of the line all series of preferred stock are perpetual are not convertible into common stock of the company and are redeemable at par upon our election five years after the issuance date the terms of the preferred stock do not contain any unconditional obligations that would require us to redeem the securities at any time or for any purpose 

common stock 

on april 5 2005 we entered into the forward sale agreement to sell 4312500 shares of our common stock at 4660 per share to citigroup in connection with the acquisition of the first washington portfolio described above on august 1 2005 we completed the sale of 3782500 shares and received proceeds of approximately 1755 million on september 7 2005 we completed the sale of the remaining 530000 shares and received proceeds of approximately 244 million the proceeds were used to redeem the series e and f preferred units repay the bridge loan and reduce the line 

in summary net cash provided by financing activities was 2238 million for the year ended december 31 2005 and net cash used in financing activities was 801 million and 1582 million for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively the significant increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily related to a net increase in outstanding debt of 1209 million and the 200 million forward sale agreement described above 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial results and discussion and analysis of these results the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities at a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period these accounting estimates are based upon but not limited to our judgments about historical results current economic activity and industry accounting standards they are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness however the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates 

revenue recognition and tenant receivables – tenant receivables represent revenues recognized in our financial statements and include base rent percentage rent and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs insurance and real estate taxes we analyze tenant receivables historical bad debt levels customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts in addition we analyze the accounts of tenants in bankruptcy and we estimate the recovery of prepetition and postpetition claims our reported net income is directly affected by our estimate of the recoverability of tenant receivables 

recognition of gains from the sales of real estate  we account for profit recognition on sales of real estate in accordance with sfas statement no 66 “accounting for sales of real estate” profits from sales of real estate will not be recognized by us unless i a sale has been consummated ii the buyer’s initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property iii we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership and iv we do not have substantial continuing involvement with the property recognition of gains from sales to joint ventures is recorded on only that portion of the sales not attributable to our ownership interest 

  

index to financial statements capitalization of costs  we have an investment services group with an established infrastructure that supports the due diligence land acquisition construction leasing and accounting of our development properties all direct costs related to these activities are capitalized included in these costs are interest and real estate taxes incurred during construction as well as estimates for the portion of internal costs that are incremental and deemed directly or indirectly related to our development activity if future accounting standards limit the amount of internal costs that may be capitalized or if our development activity were to decline significantly without a proportionate decrease in internal costs we could incur a significant increase in our operating expenses 

real estate acquisitions  upon acquisition of operating real estate properties we estimate the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land building and improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and belowmarket leases inplace leases and tenant relationships and assumed debt in accordance with statement 141 based on these estimates we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities we evaluate the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets each reporting period and account for any changes in estimated useful lives over the revised remaining useful life 

valuation of real estate investments  our longlived assets primarily real estate held for investment are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted the review involves a number of assumptions and estimates used to determine whether impairment exists depending on the asset we use varying methods such as i estimating future cash flows ii determining resale values by market or iii applying a capitalization rate to net operating income using prevailing rates in a given market these methods of determining fair value can fluctuate significantly as a result of a number of factors including changes in the general economy of those markets in which we operate tenant credit quality and demand for new retail stores if we determine that the carrying amount of a property is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value we will write down the asset to fair value for “heldandused” assets and to fair value less costs to sell for “heldforsale” assets 

discontinued operations  the application of current accounting principles that govern the classification of any of our properties as heldforsale on the balance sheet or the presentation of results of operations and gains on the sale of these properties as discontinued requires management to make certain significant judgments in evaluating whether a property meets the criteria set forth by sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment and disposal of longlived assets” “statement 144” the company makes a determination as to the point in time that it can be reasonably certain that a sale will be consummated given the nature of all real estate sales contracts it is not unusual for such contracts to allow potential buyers a period of time to evaluate the property prior to formal acceptance of the contract in addition certain other matters critical to the final sale such as financing arrangements often remain pending even upon contract acceptance as a result properties under contract may not close within the expected time period or may not close at all due to these uncertainties it is not likely that the company can meet the criteria of statement 144 prior to the sale formally closing therefore any properties categorized as held for sale represent only those properties that management has determined are likely to close within the requirements set forth in statement 144 the company also makes judgments regarding the extent of involvement it will have with a property subsequent to its sale in order to determine if the results of operations and gain on sale should be reflected as discontinued consistent with statement 144 any property sold to an entity in which the company has significant continuing involvement most often joint ventures is not considered to be discontinued in addition any property which the company sells to an unrelated third party but retains a property or asset management function is also not considered discontinued therefore only properties sold or to be sold to unrelated third parties that the company in its judgment has no continuing involvement with are classified as discontinued 

investments in real estate joint ventures – in addition to owning real estate directly we invest in real estate through our coinvestment joint ventures joint venturing provides us with a capital source to 

  

index to financial statements acquire real estate and to earn our prorata share of the net income from the joint ventures in addition to fees for services as asset and property manager we conduct the business of the shopping centers held in the joint ventures in the same way that we conduct the business of our whollyowned shopping centers therefore the critical accounting policies as described are also applicable to our investments in the joint ventures and the fees that we earn we account for all investments in which we own 50 or less and do not have a controlling financial interest using the equity method we have determined that these investments are not variable interest entities and therefore are subject to the voting interest model in determining our basis of accounting major decisions including property acquisitions and dispositions financings annual budgets and dissolution of the ventures are subject to the approval of all partners 

income tax status  the prevailing assumption underlying the operation of our business is that we will continue to operate in order to qualify as a reit as defined under the internal revenue code we are required to meet certain income and asset tests on a periodic basis to ensure that we continue to qualify as a reit as a reit we are allowed to reduce taxable income by all or a portion of our distributions to stockholders we evaluate the transactions that we enter into and determine their impact on our reit status determining our taxable income calculating distributions and evaluating transactions requires us to make certain judgments and estimates as to the positions we take in our interpretation of the internal revenue code because many types of transactions are susceptible to varying interpretations under federal and state income tax laws and regulations our positions are subject to change at a later date upon final determination by the taxing authorities 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in october 2005 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued staff position no fas 131 “accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period” this fsp requires that rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases incurred during a construction period be recognized as rental expense however fsp no fas 131 does not address lessees that account for the sale or rental of real estate projects under fasb statement no 67 “accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects” 

in june 2005 the fasb ratified the eitf’s consensus on issue no 045 “determining whether a general partner or the general partners as a group controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights” this consensus establishes the presumption that general partners in a limited partnership control that limited partnership regardless of the extent of the general partners’ ownership interest in the limited partnership the consensus further establishes that the rights of the limited partners can overcome the presumption of control by the general partners if the limited partners have either a the substantive ability to dissolve liquidate the limited partnership or otherwise remove the general partners without cause or b substantive participating rights whether the presumption of control is overcome is a matter of judgment based on the facts and circumstances for which the consensus provides additional guidance this consensus is currently applicable to us for new partnerships created in 2005 and will be applicable to all partnerships beginning january 1 2006 this consensus applies to limited partnerships or similar entities such as limited liability companies that have governing provisions that are the functional equivalent of a limited partnership we have applied eitf issue no 045 to our joint ventures and concluded that it does not require the consolidation of additional entities 

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 accounting changes and error corrections “statement 154” statement 154 requires restatement of prior periods’ financial statements for changes in accounting principle unless it is impracticable to determine either the periodspecific effects or the cumulative effect of the change statement 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change statement 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 we are not currently aware of any future potential accounting changes which would require the retrospective application described in statement 154 

  

index to financial statements in march 2005 the fasb issued fin 47 accounting for asset retirement obligations as amended fin 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement thus the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event accordingly an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated fin 47 is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2005 we are not currently aware of any asset retirement obligations beyond those currently recorded in the consolidated balance sheets which would have a material effect on our financial condition 

on december 16 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “statement 123r” which is a revision of sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” “statement 123” statement 123r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” “opinion 25” and generally the approach is similar to the approach described in statement 123 however statement 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values and proforma disclosure is no longer an alternative statement 123r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 31 2005 however we elected early adoption effective january 1 2005 as permitted by statement 123r we have applied the “modified prospective” method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement 123r for all sharebased payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement 123r that remain unvested on the effective date 

prior to 2005 we followed the provisions of sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation  transition and disclosure” “statement 148” which provided alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation in addition statement 148 amended the disclosure requirements of statement 123 to require more prominent and frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects of stockbased compensation as permitted under statement 123 and statement 148 we previously followed the accounting guidelines pursuant to opinion 25 for stockbased compensation and furnished the proforma disclosures as required under statement 148 during 2004 and 2003 we accounted for sharebased payments to employees using opinion 25’s intrinsic value method and recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options 

in december 2004 the fasb issued statement no 153 exchange of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 29 “statement 153” the guidance in apb opinion no 29 accounting for nonmonetary transactions is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged the guidance in that opinion however included certain exceptions to that principle statement 153 amends opinion no 29 to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange statement 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2005 the impact of adopting statement 153 has not had a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position or results of operations 

results from operations 

comparison of the years ended december 31 2005 to 2004 

at december 31 2005 on a combined basis we were operating or developing 393 shopping centers as compared to 291 shopping centers at the end of 2004 we identify our shopping centers as either development properties or stabilized properties development properties are defined as properties that are in the construction or initial leaseup process and have not reached their initial full occupancy reaching full occupancy generally means achieving at least 93 leased and rent paying on newly constructed or renovated gla at december 31 2005 on a combined basis we were developing 31 properties as compared to 34 properties at the end of 2004 

  

index to financial statements our revenues increased by 231 million or 6 to 3940 million in 2005 as a result of mcwr ii acquiring the first washington portfolio on june 1 2005 we recorded 138 million in fees related to acquisition due diligence and capital restructuring services that we provided to mcwr ii mcwr ii paid us approximately 212 million for these services however as previously discussed the amount recognized as fee income includes only that portion of fees paid by the venture not owned by us 

the increase in revenues was also related to changes in occupancy in the portfolio of stabilized and development properties growth in releasing rental rates and revenues from new developments commencing operations in the current year in addition to collecting minimum rent from our tenants for the gla that they lease from us we also collect percentage rent based upon tenant sales tenants are also responsible for reimbursing us for their prorata share of the expenses associated with operating our shopping centers in 2005 our minimum rent increased by 141 million or 5 and our recoveries from tenants increased 43 million or 6 percentage rent was 44 million in 2005 compared with 38 million in 2004 

the equity in income of real estate partnerships declined 131 million to a loss of 29 million in 2005 the loss was a result of the significant amount of depreciation and amortization expense being recorded by mcwr ii since the acquisition of the first washington portfolio on june 1 2005 excluding the depreciation and amortization mcwr ii produced positive cash flow from operations during the period 

our operating expenses increased by 103 million or 5 to 2135 million in 2005 related to increased operating and maintenance costs general and administrative costs and depreciation expense as further described below 

our combined operating maintenance and real estate taxes increased by 37 million or 4 for the year ended december 31 2005 to 923 million this increase was primarily due to shopping center developments that recently began operating and therefore did not incur operating expenses for a full comparable 12 months in the previous year during the 2005 hurricane season we did not incur any significant damages to our shopping centers 

our general and administrative expenses increased 75 million to 378 million during 2005 the increase is related to additional salary costs for new employees necessary to manage the first washington portfolio under a property management agreement with mcwr ii and higher stock based compensation expenses associated with the early adoption of statement 123r which requires the expensing of stock options during 2005 we recorded compensation expense associated with stock options of 14 million 

our depreciation and amortization expense increased 43 million to 807 million in 2005 primarily related to new development properties placed in service in the current year that had no operations during the comparable prior year period 

our net interest expense increased 77 million to 874 million in 2005 from 797 million in 2004 primarily related to the financing of our investment in mcwr ii on june 1 2005 we borrowed 275 million on the bridge loan and 122 million on the line to fund our investment during july and august we repaid the bridge loan and reduced the line using a portion of the proceeds from the 200 million forward sale agreement a 75 million preferred stock offering and the issuance of 350 million of 548 fixed rate debt average interest rates on our outstanding debt increased to 634 at december 31 2005 compared to 624 at december 31 2004 our weighted average outstanding debt at december 31 2005 was 16 billion compared to 15 billion at december 31 2004 

gains from the sale of operating properties and properties in development during 2005 includes 87 million in gains from the sale of 26 outparcels for proceeds of 290 million and 103 million in 

  

index to financial statements gains related to the sale of three development properties and one operating property in 2004 the gains from the sale of operating and development properties included 189 million from the sale of 41 outparcels for proceeds of 604 million and 205 million in gains from shopping centers sold these gains are included in continuing operations rather than discontinued operations because they were either properties that had no operating income or they were properties sold to joint ventures where we have continuing involvement through our equity investment 

we review our real estate portfolio for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of an asset we determine whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property’s carrying value to an estimate of fair value based upon methods described in our critical accounting policies in the event a property is impaired we write down the asset to fair value for “heldandused” assets and to fair value less costs to sell for “heldfor sale” assets during 2005 and 2004 we established provisions for loss of 550000 and 810000 respectively to adjust operating properties to their estimated fair values 

income from discontinued operations was 616 million in 2005 related to 14 properties sold to unrelated parties for net proceeds of 1752 million and four properties classified as heldforsale income from discontinued operations was 319 million in 2004 related to the operations of shopping centers sold or classified as heldforsale in 2005 as well as 2004 in compliance with statement 144 if we sell an asset in the current year we are required to reclassify its operating income into discontinued operations for all prior periods this practice results in a reclassification of amounts previously reported as continuing operations into discontinued operations our income from discontinued operations is shown net of minority interest of exchangeable partnership units totaling 12 million and 603727 and income taxes totaling 36 million and 23 million for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively 

minority interest of preferred units declined 117 million to 81 million in 2005 as a result of redeeming 54 million of preferred units in 2005 and redeeming 125 million of preferred units in 2004 preferred stock dividends increased 81 million to 167 million in 2005 as a result of the issuance of 75 million of preferred stock in 2005 and 125 million preferred stock in 2004 

net income for common stockholders increased 182 million to 1459 million in 2005 as compared with 1277 million in 2004 diluted earnings per share were 223 in 2005 compared with 208 in 2004 or 7 higher a result of the increase in net income and an increase in weighted average common shares associated with the forward sale agreement discussed above 

comparison of the years ended december 31 2004 to 2003 

at december 31 2004 on a combined basis we were operating or developing 291 shopping centers as compared to 265 shopping centers at the end of 2003 and we were developing 34 properties at the end of 2004 as compared to 36 properties at the end of 2003 

our revenues increased by 250 million or 7 to 3709 million in 2004 this increase was related to changes in occupancy in the portfolio of stabilized and development properties growth in releasing rental rates shopping centers acquired during 2004 and revenues from new developments commencing operations in 2004 in 2004 our minimum rent increased by 182 million or 7 and our recoveries from tenants increased 42 million or 6 percentage rent was 38 million in 2004 compared with 43 million in 2003 the reduction was primarily related to renewing anchor tenant leases with minimum rent increases which had a corresponding reduction to percentage rent 

our operating expenses increased by 219 million or 12 to 2032 million in 2004 related to increased operating and maintenance costs general and administrative costs and depreciation expense as further described below 

our combined operating maintenance and real estate taxes increased by 50 million or 6 during 2004 to 886 million this increase was primarily due to shopping centers acquired in 2004 new 

  

index to financial statements developments that only recently began operating and therefore incurred operating expenses for only a portion of the previous year normal increases in operating expenses on the stabilized properties and the cost to repair our shopping centers impacted by hurricanes during 2004 during 2004 three hurricanes affected 42 of our shopping centers in florida and our repair costs related to the hurricanes were approximately 1 million 

our general and administrative expenses were 303 million during 2004 compared with 242 million in 2003 or 25 higher related to an increase in the total number of employees necessary to properly manage our real estate portfolio and costs related to implementing new regulations for public companies imposed by the sarbanesoxley act 

our depreciation and amortization expense increased 78 million during 2004 primarily related to shopping centers acquired during the year and new development properties placed in service during 2004 

our net interest expense decreased to 797 million in 2004 from 823 million in 2003 average interest rates on our outstanding debt declined to 624 at december 31 2004 compared with 649 at december 31 2003 the reduction was primarily related to reducing the interest rate spread on the line and issuing 150 million of 495 notes in april 2004 the proceeds of which were used to repay maturing notes that had fixed rates of 74 our weighted average outstanding debt during 2004 was 15 billion compared with 14 billion in 2003 

gains from the sale of operating and development properties includes 189 million in gains from the sale of 41 outparcels for proceeds of 604 million and 205 million for properties sold to joint ventures during 2003 the gains from the sale of operating and development properties included 116 million from the sale of 45 outparcels for proceeds of 530 million and 371 million for properties sold these gains are included in continuing operations rather than discontinued operations because they were either properties that had no operating income or they were properties sold to joint ventures where we have continuing involvement through our minority investment 

during 2004 and 2003 we established provisions for loss of 810000 and 20 million respectively to adjust operating properties to their estimated fair values provisions for loss on properties subsequently sold are reclassified to discontinued operations therefore the 20 million recorded in 2003 has been reclassified 

income from discontinued operations was 319 million in 2004 as compared to 324 million in 2003 discontinued operations pertain to properties either heldforsale or properties sold to third parties that had operations during the period our income from discontinued operations is shown net of minority interest of exchangeable partnership units totaling 603727 and 727117 and income taxes totaling 23 million and 560402 for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively 

minority interest of preferred units declined 10 million to 198 million in 2004 as a result of redeeming 125 million of preferred units during 2004 preferred stock dividends increased 45 million to 86 million in 2004 as a result of the issuance of 125 million of preferred stock the proceeds of which were used to redeem the preferred units 

net income for common stockholders was 1277 million in 2004 compared with 1266 million in 2003 or a 1 increase for the reasons described above diluted earnings per share were 208 in 2004 compared with 212 in 2003 or 2 lower although net income for common stockholders increased 11 million during 2004 the increase was diluted as a result of an increase in weighted average common shares associated with the 67 million common stock offering completed in august 2004 

environmental matters 

we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry the existence of asbestos in older 

  

index to financial statements shopping centers and underground petroleum storage tanks ust’s we believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations generally we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to nonchlorinated solvent systems where available we have applied and been accepted into statesponsored environmental programs we have a blanket environmental insurance policy that covers us against thirdparty liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination we have also placed environmental insurance where possible on specific properties with known contamination in order to mitigate our environmental risk we monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites we also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so we estimate the cost associated with these legal obligations to be approximately 27 million we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material affect on regency’s financial position liquidity or operations however we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies with respect to our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities that any previous owner occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants by the condition of nearby properties or by unrelated third parties or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us 

inflation 

inflation has remained relatively low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers however substantially all of our longterm leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation such provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rent based on tenants’ gross sales which generally increase as prices rise andor escalation clauses which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices in addition many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years which permits us to seek increased rents upon rerental at market rates most of our leases require tenants to pay their share of operating expenses including commonarea maintenance real estate taxes insurance and utilities thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

we are exposed to interestrate changes primarily related to the variable interest rate on the line and the refinancing of longterm debt which currently contain fixed interest rates the objective of our interestrate risk management is to limit the impact of interestrate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we borrow primarily at fixed interest rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interestrate swaps caps or treasury locks in order to mitigate our interestrate risk on a related financial instrument we have no plans to enter into derivative or interestrate transactions for speculative purposes 

our interestrate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the table below presents the principal cash flows in thousands weighted average interest rates of remaining debt and the fair value of total debt in thousands as of december 31 2005 by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interestrate changes 

 

 as the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2005 it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date moreover because firm commitments are not presented in the table above the information presented above has limited predictive value as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interestrate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at that time and actual interest rates

 the company leases space to tenants under agreements with varying terms leases are accounted for as operating leases with minimum rent recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the lease regardless of when payments are due as part of the leasing process the company may provide the lessee with an allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements leasehold improvements are capitalized as part of the building and recorded as tenant improvements and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvements or the lease term if the allowance represents a payment for a purpose other than funding leasehold improvements or in the event the company is not considered the owner of the improvements the allowance is considered to be a lease incentive and is recognized over the lease term as a reduction of rental revenue factors considered during this evaluation include among others who holds legal title to the improvements and other controlling rights provided by the lease agreement eg unilateral control of the tenant space during the buildout process determination of the accounting for a tenant allowance is made on a casebycase basis considering the facts and circumstances of the individual tenant lease lease revenue recognition commences when the lessee is given possession of the leased space upon completion of tenant improvements accrued rents are included in tenant receivables 

substantially all of the lease agreements contain provisions that grant additional rents based on tenants’ sales volume contingent or percentage rent and reimbursement of the tenants’ share of real estate taxes insurance and common area maintenance “cam” costs percentage rents are recognized when the tenants achieve the specified targets as defined in their lease agreements recovery of real estate taxes insurance and cam costs are recognized as the respective costs are incurred in accordance with the lease agreements

 land buildings and improvements are recorded at cost all specifically identifiable costs related to development activities are capitalized into properties in development on the consolidated balance sheets the capitalized costs include predevelopment costs essential to the development of the property development costs construction costs interest costs real estate taxes and direct employee costs incurred during the period of development 

the company incurs costs prior to land acquisition including contract deposits as well as legal engineering and other external professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center these predevelopment costs are included in properties in development if the company determines that the development of a particular shopping center is no longer probable any related predevelopment costs previously incurred are immediately expensed at december 31 2005 and 2004 the company had capitalized predevelopment costs of 122 million and 105 million respectively 

the company’s method of capitalizing interest is based upon applying its weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the actual development costs expended the company ceases cost capitalization when the property is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements in no event would the company capitalize interest on the project beyond 12 months after substantial completion of the building shell 

maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the useful lives of the respective assets are reflected in operating and maintenance expense 

depreciation is computed using the straightline method over estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings and improvements term of lease for tenant improvements and three to seven years for furniture and equipment 

the company and the unconsolidated joint ventures allocate the purchase price of assets acquired net tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values at the date of acquisition pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 141 “business combinations” “statement 141” statement 141 provides guidance on allocating a portion of the purchase price of a property to intangible assets the company’s methodology for this allocation includes estimating an “asif vacant” fair value of the physical property which is allocated to land building and improvements the difference between the purchase price and the “asif vacant” fair value is allocated to intangible assets there are three categories of intangible assets to be considered i value of inplace leases ii above and belowmarket value of inplace leases and iii customer relationship value 

the value of inplace leases is estimated based on the value associated with the costs avoided in originating leases compared to the acquired inplace leases as well as the value associated with lost rental and recovery revenue during the assumed leaseup period the value of inplace leases is amortized to expense over the remaining initial term of the respective leases

 abovemarket and belowmarket inplace lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the inplace leases and ii management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for the comparable inplace leases measured over a period equal to the remaining noncancelable term of the lease the value of abovemarket leases is amortized as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining terms of the respective leases the value of belowmarket leases is accreted as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining terms of the respective leases including renewal options 

the company allocates no value to customer relationship intangibles if it has preexisting business relationships with the major retailers in the acquired property since those associated with the acquired property provide no incremental value over the company’s existing relationships 

the company follows the provisions of sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” “statement 144” in accordance with statement 144 the company classifies an operating property as held–forsale when it determines that the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition the property is being actively marketed for sale and management is reasonably certain that a sale will be consummated operating properties heldforsale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell depreciation and amortization are suspended during the heldforsale period the operations of properties heldforsale are reclassified into discontinued operations for all periods presented 

in accordance with statement 144 when the company sells a property and will not have continuing involvement after disposition its operations and gain on sale are reported in discontinued operations when the operations and cash flows are clearly distinguished once classified as discontinued operations these properties are eliminated from ongoing operations prior periods are also restated to reflect the operations of these properties as discontinued operations when the company sells operating properties to its joint ventures or to third parties and it will have continuing involvement the operations and gains on sales are included in income from continuing operations 

the company reviews its real estate portfolio for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable based upon expected undiscounted cash flows from the property the company determines impairment by comparing the property’s carrying value to an estimate of fair value based upon varying methods such as i estimating future cash flows ii determining resale values by market or iii applying a capitalization rate to net operating income using prevailing rates in a given market these methods of determining fair value can fluctuate significantly as a result of a number of factors including changes in the general economy of those markets in which the company operates tenant credit quality and demand for new retail stores in the event that the carrying amount of a property is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value the company will write down the asset to fair value for “heldandused” assets and to fair value less costs to sell for “heldforsale” assets during 2005 2004 and 2003 the company recorded a provision for loss of approximately 550000 810000 and 20 million based upon the criteria described above the provision for loss on properties subsequently sold to third parties is included as part of discontinued operations

 the company believes it qualifies and intends to continue to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code the “code” as a reit the company will generally not be subject to federal income tax provided that distributions to its stockholders are at least equal to reit taxable income 

earnings and profits which determine the taxability of dividends to stockholders differs from net income reported for financial reporting purposes primarily because of differences in depreciable lives and cost bases of the shopping centers as well as other timing differences 

the net book basis of real estate assets exceeds the tax basis by approximately 1313 million and 1039 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively primarily due to the difference between the cost basis of the assets acquired and their carryover basis recorded for tax purposes

 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates 

 

 regency grants stockbased compensation to its employees all of which are employed by the partnership when regency issues common shares as compensation it receives a comparable number of common units from the partnership including stock options regency is committed to contribute to the partnership all proceeds from the exercise of stock options or other stockbased awards granted under regency’s longterm omnibus plan accordingly regency’s ownership in the partnership will increase based on the amount of proceeds contributed to the partnership for the common units it receives as a result of the issuance of common units to regency for stockbased compensation the partnership accounts for stockbased compensation in the same manner as regency 

on december 16 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “statement 123r” which is a revision of sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” “statement 123” statement 123r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” “opinion 25” and generally the approach is similar to the approach described in statement 123 however statement 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values and proforma disclosure is no longer an alternative statement 123r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 31 2005 however the company elected early adoption effective january 1 2005 as permitted by statement 123r the company has applied the “modified prospective” method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement 123r for all sharebased payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement 123r that remain unvested on the effective date see note 10 for further discussion 

prior to 2005 the company followed the provisions of sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure” “statement 148” which provided alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation in addition statement 148 amended the disclosure requirements of statement 123 to require more prominent and frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects of stockbased compensation as permitted under statement 123 and statement 148 the company previously followed the accounting guidelines pursuant to opinion 25 for stockbased compensation and furnished the proforma disclosures as required under statement 148 during 2004 and 2003 the company accounted for sharebased payments to employees using opinion 25’s intrinsic value method and recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options had the company adopted statement 123r in 2004 and 2003 the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement 123 in the disclosure of proforma net income and earnings per share as further described in note 10

 the company’s business is investing in retail shopping centers through direct ownership or through joint ventures the company actively manages its portfolio of retail shopping centers and may from time to time make decisions to sell lower performing properties or developments not meeting its longterm investment objectives the proceeds of sales are reinvested into higher quality retail shopping centers through acquisitions or new developments which management believes will meet its planned rate of return it is management’s intent that all retail shopping centers will be owned or developed for investment purposes the company’s revenue and net income are generated from the operation of its investment portfolio the company also earns fees from third parties for services provided to manage and lease retail shopping centers owned through joint ventures 

the company’s portfolio is located throughout the united states however management does not distinguish or group its operations on a geographical basis for purposes of allocating resources or measuring performance the company reviews operating and financial data for each property on an individual basis therefore the company defines an operating segment as its individual properties no individual property constitutes more than 10 of the company’s combined revenue net income or assets and thus the individual properties have been aggregated into one reportable segment based upon their similarities with regard to both the nature and economics of the centers tenants and operational processes as well as longterm average financial performance in addition no single tenant accounts for 10 or more of revenue and none of the shopping centers are located outside the united states 

 

 the company adopted sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” “statement 133” as amended by sfas no 149 statement 133 requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting the company’s use of derivative financial instruments is normally to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or forecasted transaction through the use of interest rate swaps 

statement 133 requires that changes in fair value of derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges be recognized in other comprehensive income “oci” while the ineffective portion of the derivative’s change in fair value be recognized immediately in earnings upon the settlement of a hedge gains and losses associated with the transaction are recorded in oci and amortized over the underlying term of the hedge transaction historically all of the company’s derivative instruments have qualified for hedge accounting 

to determine the fair value of derivative instruments the company uses standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis option pricing models and termination costs at each balance sheet date all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value and such value may never actually be realized

 in may 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 150 “accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity” “statement 150” statement 150 affects the accounting for certain financial instruments which requires companies having consolidated entities with specified termination dates to treat minority owners’ interests in such entities as liabilities in an amount based on the fair value of the entities although statement 150 was originally effective july 1 2003 the fasb has indefinitely deferred certain provisions related to classification and measurement requirements for mandatory redeemable financial instruments that become subject to statement 150 solely as a result of consolidation including minority interests of entities with specified termination dates as a result statement 150 had no impact on the company’s consolidated statements of operations for the periods ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

at december 31 2005 the company held a majority interest in two consolidated entities with specified termination dates of 2017 and 2049 the minority owners’ interests in these entities will be settled upon termination by distribution or transfer of either cash or specific assets of the underlying entities the estimated fair value of minority interests in entities with specified termination dates was approximately 72 million at december 31 2005 as compared to their carrying value of 11 million the company has no other financial instruments that are affected by statement 150 

 

 in october 2005 the fasb issued staff position no fas 131 “accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period” this fsp requires that rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases incurred during a construction period be recognized as rental expense however fsp no fas 131 does not address lessees that account for the sale or rental of real estate projects under fasb statement no 67 “accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects” 

in june 2005 the fasb ratified the eitf’s consensus on issue no 045 “determining whether a general partner or the general partners as a group controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights” this consensus establishes the presumption that general partners in a limited partnership control that limited partnership regardless of the extent of the general partners’ ownership interest in the limited partnership the consensus further establishes that the rights of the limited partners can overcome the presumption of control by the general partners if the limited partners have either a the substantive ability to dissolve liquidate the limited partnership or otherwise remove the general partners without cause or b substantive participating rights whether the presumption of control is overcome is a matter of judgment based on the facts and circumstances for which the consensus provides additional guidance this consensus is currently applicable to the company for new partnerships created in 2005 and will be applicable to all partnerships beginning january 1 2006 this consensus applies to limited partnerships or similar entities such as limited liability companies that have governing provisions that are the functional equivalent of a limited partnership the company has applied eitf issue no 045 to its joint ventures and concluded that it does not require consolidation of additional entities

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 153 “exchange of nonmonetary assets” an amendment of apb opinion no 29 “statement 153” the guidance in apb opinion no 29 accounting for nonmonetary transactions is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged the guidance in that opinion however included certain exceptions to that principle statement 153 amends opinion no 29 to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange statement 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2005 the impact of adopting statement 153 is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position or results of operations

operating and investment philosophy 

  

regency is a qualified real estate investment trust “reit” which began operations in 1993 our primary operating and investment goal is longterm growth in earnings per share and total shareholder return which we hope to achieve by focusing on a strategy of owning operating and developing neighborhood and community shopping centers that are anchored by marketleading supermarkets and located in areas with attractive demographics we own and operate our shopping centers through our operating partnership regency centers lp “rclp” in which we currently own approximately 98 of the operating partnership units regency’s operating investing and financing activities are generally performed by rclp its wholly owned subsidiaries and its joint ventures with third parties 

  

currently our real estate investment portfolio before depreciation totals 45 billion with 291 shopping centers in 23 states including approximately 14 billion in real estate assets composed of 78 shopping centers owned by unconsolidated joint ventures in 17 states portfolio information is presented a on a combined basis including unconsolidated joint ventures “combined basis” b on a basis that excludes the unconsolidated joint ventures “consolidated properties” and c on a basis that includes only the unconsolidated joint ventures “unconsolidated properties” we believe that providing our shopping center portfolio information under these methods provides a more complete understanding of the properties that we own including those that we partially own and for which we provide property and asset management services at december 31 2004 our gross leasable area “gla” on a combined basis totaled 338 million square feet and was 927 leased the gla for the consolidated properties totaled 245 million square feet and was 912 leased the gla for the unconsolidated properties totaled 93 million square feet and was 967 leased 

  

we earn revenues and generate operating cash flow by leasing space to grocers and retail sideshop tenants in our shopping centers we experience growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates at currently owned shopping centers and by developing new shopping centers a neighborhood center is a convenient costeffective distribution platform for food retailers grocery anchored centers generate substantial daily traffic and offer sustainable competitive advantages to their tenants this high traffic generates increased sales thereby driving higher occupancy rental rates and rentalrate growth for regency which we expect to sustain our growth in earnings per share and increase the value of our portfolio over the long term 

  

we seek a range of strong national regional and local specialty tenants for the same reason that we choose to anchor our centers with leading grocers we have created a formal partnering process — the premier customer initiative “pci” — to promote mutually beneficial relationships with our nongrocer specialty retailers the objective of the pci is for regency to build a base of specialty tenants who represent the “bestinclass” operators in their respective merchandising categories such tenants reinforce the consumer appeal and other strengths of a center’s grocery anchor help to stabilize a center’s occupancy reduce releasing downtime reduce tenant turnover and yield higher sustainable rents 

  

we grow our shopping center portfolio through new shopping center development where we acquire the land and construct the building development is customer driven meaning we generally have an executed lease from the anchor before we start construction developments serve the growth needs of our market–leading 

  

index to financial statements grocers and anchors and our specialty retail customers resulting in modern shopping centers with longterm leases from the grocery anchors and produce attractive returns on our invested capital this development process can require up to 36 months from initial land or redevelopment acquisition through construction leaseup and stabilization of rental income depending upon the size of the project generally anchor tenants begin operating their stores prior to the completion of construction of the entire center resulting in rental income during the development phase 

  

we intend to maintain a conservative capital structure to fund our growth programs without compromising our investmentgrade ratings our approach is founded on our selffunding business model this model utilizes center “recycling” as a key component our recycling strategy calls for us to redeploy the proceeds from the sales of properties into new higherquality developments that we expect to generate sustainable revenue growth and more attractive returns our commitment to maintaining a highquality shopping center portfolio dictates that we continually assess the value of all of our properties and sell those that no longer meet our longterm investment criteria 

  

joint venturing of shopping centers also provides us with a capital source for new development as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset and property management services as asset manager we are engaged by our partners to apply similar operating investment and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the joint ventures joint ventures grow their shopping center investments through acquisitions from third parties or direct purchases from regency although selling properties to joint ventures reduces our ownership interest we continue to share in the risks and rewards of centers that meet our longterm investment strategy regency is not subject to liability and has no obligations or guarantees of the joint ventures beyond its ownership percentage 

  

risk factors relating to ownership of regency common stock 

  

we are subject to certain business risks that could affect our industry which include among others 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

index to financial statements compliance with governmental regulations 

  

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate certain hazardous or toxic substances at our shopping centers these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances the cost of required remediation and the owner’s liability for remediation could exceed the value of the property andor the aggregate assets of the owner the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or rent the property or borrow using the property as collateral we have a number of properties that could require or are currently undergoing varying levels of environmental remediation environmental remediation is not currently expected to have a material financial effect on us due to reserves for remediation insurance programs designed to mitigate the cost of remediation and various stateregulated programs that shift the responsibility and cost to the state 

  

competition 

  

we are among the largest publiclyheld owners of groceryanchored shopping centers in the nation based on revenues number of properties gross leaseable area and market capitalization there are numerous companies and private individuals engaged in the ownership development acquisition and operation of shopping centers which compete with us in our targeted markets this results in competition for attracting grocery anchor tenants as well as the acquisition of existing shopping centers and new development sites we believe that the principal competitive factors in attracting tenants in our market areas are location demographics rental costs tenant mix property age and maintenance we believe that our competitive advantages include our locations within our market areas our strong demographics surrounding our shopping centers our relationships with our grocery anchor tenants and sideshop retailers our pci program which allows us to provide retailers with multiple locations our practice of maintaining and renovating of our shopping centers and our ability to source and develop new shopping centers 

  

changes in policies 

  

our board of directors establishes the policies that govern our investment and operating strategies including among others development and acquisition of shopping centers tenant and market focus debt and equity financing policies quarterly distributions to shareholders and reit tax status the board of directors may amend these policies at any time without a vote of our shareholders

we have identified certain significant risks and challenges affecting our industry and we are addressing them accordingly an economic downturn could result in declines in occupancy levels at our shopping centers which would reduce our rental revenues however we believe that our investment focus on grocery anchored shopping centers that provide daily necessities will minimize the impact of a downturn in the economy increased competition from supercenters such as walmart could result in groceryanchor closings or consolidations in the grocery store industry we closely monitor the operating performance and tenants’ sales in our shopping centers that operate near supercenters a slowdown in our shopping center development program could reduce operating revenues and gains from sales we believe that developing shopping centers in markets with strong demographics with leading grocery stores will enable us to continue to maintain our development program at historical averages

liquidity and capital resources 

  

general 

  

we expect that cash generated from revenues including gains from the sale of real estate will provide the necessary funds on a shortterm basis to pay our operating expenses interest expense scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness recurring capital expenditures necessary to maintain our shopping centers properly and distributions to stock and unit holders net cash provided by operating activities was 1839 million 1806 million and 1548 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively during the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 our gains from the sale of real estate were 605 million 659 million and 401 million we incurred capital expenditures of 117 million 135 million and 150 million to maintain our shopping centers paid scheduled principal payments of 57 million 41 million and 56 million to our lenders and paid dividends and distributions of 1572 million 1579 million and 1585 million to our share and unit holders respectively 

  

although base rent is supported by longterm lease contracts tenants who file bankruptcy are able to cancel their leases and close the related stores in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues on february 21 2005 winndixie stores inc filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code we currently lease seven stores to winndixie three of which are owned directly by us and four are owned in joint ventures our annualized base rent from winndixie including our share of the joint ventures is 15 million or less than 1 of our annual base rents as of the date of their bankruptcy filing winndixie owed regency 32841 in pastdue rent related to real estate tax reimbursements winndixie has not yet given notice to us as to whether they will reject any of the lease agreements between us we are not aware at this time of the current or pending bankruptcy of any of our other tenants that would cause a significant reduction in our revenues and no tenant represents more than 8 of our annual base rental revenues 

  

we expect to meet longterm capital requirements for maturing preferred units and debt the acquisition of real estate and the renovation or development of shopping centers from i residual cash generated from operating activities after the payments described above ii proceeds from the sale of real estate iii joint venturing of real estate iv refinancing of debt and v equity raised in the private or public markets 

  

we currently have 400 million available for equity securities under our shelf registration and rclp has 180 million available for debt under its shelf registration additionally we have the right to call and repay at par outstanding preferred units beginning five years after their issuance date at our discretion 

  

index to financial statements we intend to continue to grow our portfolio through new developments and acquisitions either directly or through our joint venture relationships because development and acquisition activities are discretionary in nature they are not expected to burden the capital resources we have currently available for liquidity requirements capital necessary to complete developmentsinprocess are funded from our line of credit regency expects that cash provided by operating activities unused amounts available under our line of credit and cash reserves are adequate to meet shortterm and committed longterm liquidity requirements

index to financial statements contractual obligations 

  

we have debt obligations related to our mortgage loans unsecured notes and our unsecured line of credit as described further below we have shopping centers that are subject to noncancelable longterm ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to us to construct andor operate a shopping center in addition we have noncancelable operating leases pertaining to office space where we conduct our business the following table summarizes our debt maturities excluding recorded debt premiums that are not obligations and obligations under noncancelable operating leases as of december 31 2004 including our prorata share of obligations within unconsolidated joint ventures in thousands 

  

   

the table of contractual obligations excludes obligations related to interest which is discussed below as part of outstanding debt 

  

outstanding debt at december 31 2004 and 2003 consists of the following in thousands 

  

   

mortgage loans are secured and may be prepaid but could be subject to yield maintenance premiums mortgage loans are generally due in monthly installments of interest and principal and mature over various terms through 2017 variable interest rates on mortgage loans are currently based on libor plus a spread in a range of 125 to 150 basis points fixed interest rates on mortgage loans range from 501 to 950 and average 671 

  

on march 26 2004 we entered into a new unsecured revolving line of credit the “line” under the new agreement we reduced the line commitment from 600 million to 500 million “line commitment” but we have the right to expand the line by an additional 150 million subject to additional lender syndication the new facility has a threeyear term a oneyear extension option at maturity and an interest rate of libor plus 75 which is a reduction of 10 basis points from the previous agreement interest rates paid on the line which are based on libor plus 75 were 31875 at december 31 2004 and libor plus 85 or 1975 at december 31 2003 the spread that we pay on the line is 

  

index to financial statements dependent upon maintaining specific investmentgrade ratings we are also required to comply and are in compliance with certain financial covenants such as minimum net worth total liabilities to gross asset value “gav” secured indebtedness to gav and other covenants customary with this type of unsecured financing the line is used primarily to finance the development and acquisition of real estate but is also available for general workingcapital purposes 

  

on february 15 2005 we executed a commitment letter related to the line which will temporarily modify certain line covenants related to borrowing capacity and leverage and will also add a temporary bridge loan for 275 million “bridge commitment” the temporary modifications will expire and the bridge commitment will mature nine months after the closing of the fw portfolio into mcwr ii the bridge commitment combined with existing borrowing capacity under the line will provide sufficient cash for our equity investment into mcwr ii these borrowings will raise our debt to assets leverage ratio above current levels which could exceed the current allowable line covenant leverage ratio of 55 the temporary modification to the leverage covenant is intended to keep us from defaulting on the line during the term that the bridge commitment is outstanding we intend to payoff the bridge commitment within the nine month term through a combination of issuing equity and selling shopping centers under our capital recycling program 

  

as of december 31 2004 scheduled principal repayments on notes payable and the line were as follows in thousands 

  

   

our investments in real estate partnerships had unconsolidated notes and mortgage loans payable of 6655 million at december 31 2004 which mature through 2028 our proportionate share of these loans was 1681 million of which 87 had average fixed interest rates of 547 and 13 had variable interest rates based upon a spread above libor of 12 to 16 the loans are primarily nonrecourse but for those that are guaranteed by a joint venture our guarantee does not extend beyond our ownership percentage of the joint venture 

  

we are exposed to capital market risk such as changes in interest rates in order to manage the volatility related to interestrate risk we originate new debt with fixed interest rates or we consider entering into interestrate hedging arrangements at december 31 2004 82 of our total debt had fixed interest rates compared with 84 at december 31 2003 we intend to limit the percentage of variable interestrate debt to be no more than 30 of total debt which we believe to be an acceptable risk based upon the variable interestrate debt outstanding at december 31 2004 if variable interest rates were to increase by 1 our annual interest expense would increase by 27 million we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes we account for derivative instruments under statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended “statement 133” 

  

on april 1 2004 we completed the sale of 150 million tenyear senior unsecured notes the “notes” the 495 notes are due april 15 2014 and were priced at 99747 to yield 4982 the proceeds of the offering combined with borrowings from the line were used to repay 200 million of 74 notes that matured on april 1 2004 related to the offering we settled two forwardstarting interest rate 

  

index to financial statements swaps that were initiated in 2003 totaling 1442 million on march 31 2004 the interest rate swaps were settled for 57 million which is recorded in other comprehensive income “oci” and is being amortized over the tenyear term of the notes to interest expense the swaps qualified for hedge accounting under statement 133 therefore the change in fair value was recorded in oci after taking into account the hedge settlement the effective interest rate on the notes is 547 

  

equity capital transactions 

  

from time to time we issue equity in the form of exchangeable operating partnership units or preferred units of rclp or in the form of common or preferred stock of regency centers corporation as previously discussed these sources of longterm equity financing allow us to fund our growth while maintaining a conservative capital structure the following describes our equity capital transactions during 2004 

  

preferred units 

  

we have issued preferred units in various amounts since 1998 the net proceeds of which we used to reduce the balance of the line we issued preferred units primarily to institutional investors in private placements the preferred units which may be called by us in 2005 and 2009 have no stated maturity or mandatory redemption and they pay a cumulative quarterly dividend at fixed rates ranging from 745 to 875 generally the preferred units may be exchanged by the holders for cumulative redeemable preferred stock at an exchange rate of one share for one unit after ten years from the date of issue or as modified and agreed to by us the preferred units and the related preferred stock are not convertible into regency common stock at december 31 2004 and 2003 the face value of total preferred units issued was 104 million and 229 million with an average fixed distribution rate of 813 and 888 respectively included in preferred units are original issuance costs of 22 million that will be expensed as the underlying preferred units are redeemed in the future 

  

we expect that we will either redeem 54 million of preferred units in 2005 or renegotiate the dividend rate to a lower market rate of distribution if we decide to redeem these preferred units we will likely issue common stock or preferred stock to finance the redemption price 

  

on november 11 2004 we renegotiated the distribution rate on the outstanding balance of 50 million of series d preferred units from 9125 to 745 previously on september 3 2004 we redeemed 85 million of series b 875 preferred units and 40 million of series c 90 preferred units from proceeds of a series 4 preferred stock offering described below at the time of the redemptions 32 million of previously deferred costs related to the original preferred units’ issuance were recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as minority interest of preferred units 

  

preferred stock 

  

on august 31 2004 we sold 5 million depositary shares representing 500000 shares of series 4 cumulative redeemable preferred stock for 125 million the depositary shares are perpetual preferred stock are not convertible into common stock of the company are redeemable at par upon our election on or after august 31 2009 pay a 725 annual dividend and have a liquidation value of 25 per depositary share the proceeds from this offering were used to redeem preferred units the terms of the series 4 preferred stock do not contain any unconditional obligations that would require us to redeem the securities at any time or for any purpose 

  

common stock 

  

on august 24 2004 we sold 15 million shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering and the net proceeds of approximately 67 million were used to reduce the balance of the line 

  

in summary net cash used in financing activities related to the debt and equity activity discussed above was 801 million 1582 million and 2550 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

index to financial statements critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial results and discussion and analysis of these results the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities at a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period these accounting estimates are based upon but not limited to our judgments about historical results current economic activity and industry standards they are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness however the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates 

  

revenue recognition and tenant receivables – tenant receivables represent revenues recognized in our financial statements and include base rent percentage rent and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs insurance and real estate taxes we analyze tenant receivables historical bad debt levels customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts in addition we analyze the accounts of tenants in bankruptcy and we estimate the recovery of prepetition and postpetition claims our reported net income is directly affected by our estimate of the collectability of tenant receivables 

  

capitalization of costs  we have an investment services group with an established infrastructure that supports the due diligence land acquisition construction leasing and accounting of our development properties all direct costs related to these activities are capitalized included in these costs are interest and real estate taxes incurred during construction as well as estimates for the portion of internal costs that are incremental and deemed directly or indirectly related to our development activity if future accounting standards limit the amount of internal costs that may be capitalized or if our development activity were to decline significantly without a proportionate decrease in internal costs we could incur a significant increase in our operating expenses 

  

real estate acquisitions  upon acquisition of operating real estate properties we estimate the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land building and improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and belowmarket leases inplace leases and tenant relationships and assumed debt in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 141 business combinations “statement 141” based on these estimates we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities we evaluate the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets each reporting period and account for any changes in estimated useful lives over the revised remaining useful life 

  

valuation of real estate investments  our longlived assets primarily real estate held for investment are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted the review involves a number of assumptions and estimates used to determine whether impairment exists depending on the asset we use varying methods such as i estimating future cash flows ii determining resale values by market or iii applying a capitalization rate to net operating income using prevailing rates in a given market these methods of determining fair value can fluctuate significantly as a result of a number of factors including changes in the general economy of those markets in which we operate tenant credit quality and demand for new retail stores if we determine that permanent impairment exists due to our inability to recover an asset’s carrying value a provision for loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value 

  

index to financial statements discontinued operations  the application of current accounting principles that govern the classification of any of our properties as held for sale on the balance sheet or the presentation of results of operations and gains on the sale of these properties as discontinued requires management to make certain significant judgments in evaluating whether a property meets the criteria set forth by sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment and disposal of longlived assets” “statement 144” the company makes a determination as to the point in time that it can be reasonably certain that a sale will be consummated given the nature of all real estate sales contracts it is not unusual for such contracts to allow potential buyers a period of time to evaluate the property prior to formal acceptance of the contract in addition certain other matters critical to the final sale such as financing arrangements often remain pending even upon contract acceptance as a result properties under contract may not close within the expected time period or may not close at all due to these uncertainties it is not likely that the company can meet the criteria of statement 144 prior to the sale formally closing therefore any properties categorized as held for sale represent only those properties that management has determined are likely to close within the requirements set forth in statement 144 the company also makes judgments regarding the extent of involvement it will have with a property subsequent to its sale in order to determine if the results of operations and gain on sale should be reflected as discontinued consistent with statement 144 any property sold to an entity in which the company has significant continuing involvement most often joint ventures is not considered to be discontinued in addition any property which the company sells to an unrelated third party but retains a property or asset management function is also not considered discontinued therefore only properties sold or to be sold to unrelated third parties that the company in its judgment has no continuing involvement are classified as discontinued 

  

income tax status  the prevailing assumption underlying the operation of our business is that we will continue to operate in order to qualify as a reit defined under the internal revenue code we are required to meet certain income and asset tests on a periodic basis to ensure that we continue to qualify as a reit as a reit we are allowed to reduce taxable income by all or a portion of our distributions to stockholders we evaluate the transactions that we enter into and determine their impact on our reit status determining our taxable income calculating distributions and evaluating transactions requires us to make certain judgments and estimates as to the positions we take in our interpretation of the internal revenue code because many types of transactions are susceptible to varying interpretations under federal and state income tax laws and regulations our positions are subject to change at a later date upon final determination by the taxing authorities 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

on december 16 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “statement 123r” which is a revision of statement 123 statement 123r supersedes opinion 25 generally the approach in statement 123r is similar to the approach described in statement 123 however statement 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values proforma disclosure is no longer an alternative statement 123r must be adopted no later than july 1 2005 

  

statement 123r permits companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods 

  

1 the “modified prospective” method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement 123r for all sharebased payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement 123r that remain unvested on the effective date 

  

2 the “modified retrospective” method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement 123 for purposes of proforma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 

  

index to financial statements the company adopted statement 123r using the modified prospective method on january 1 2005 

  

as permitted by statement 123 the company currently accounts for sharebased payments to employees using opinion 25’s intrinsic value method and as such generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options accordingly the adoption of statement 123r’s fair value method will have an impact on its results of operations in 2005 as described in note 1i to the consolidated financial statements 

  

we have a longterm omnibus plan the “plan” under which our board of directors may grant stock options and other stockbased awards to officers directors and other key employees all stock options previously granted contained stock option “reload” rights the “reload” rights allowed for an option holder to receive new options each time existing options were exercised if the existing options were exercised under specific criteria provided for in the plan in january 2005 we offered to acquire the “reload” rights of existing stock options from our employees by issuing them additional stock options that will vest 25 per year over four years as a result of the offer on january 18 2005 we granted 771645 options with an exercise price of 5136 the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant as a result substantially all of the “reload” rights on existing stock options have been cancelled the options granted in january 2005 will be expensed to net income over a fouryear period beginning in 2005 in accordance with statement 123r 

  

results from operations 

  

comparison of the years ended december 31 2004 to 2003 

  

at december 31 2004 on a combined basis we were operating or developing 291 shopping centers as compared to 265 shopping centers at the end of 2003 we identify our shopping centers as either development properties or stabilized properties development properties are defined as properties that are in the construction or initial leaseup process and have not reached their initial full occupancy reaching full occupancy generally means achieving at least 93 leased and rent paying on newly constructed or renovated gla at december 31 2004 on a combined basis we were developing 34 properties as compared to 36 properties at the end of 2003 

  

our revenues increased by 287 million or 8 to 3919 million in 2004 this increase was related to changes in occupancy in the portfolio of stabilized and development properties growth in releasing rental rates shopping centers acquired during 2004 and revenues from new developments commencing operations in 2004 net of a reduction in revenues from properties sold in addition to collecting minimum rent from our tenants for the gla that they lease from us we also collect contingent rent based upon tenant sales which we refer to as percentage rent tenants are also responsible for reimbursing us for their prorata share of the expenses associated with operating our shopping centers in 2004 our minimum rent increased by 214 million or 8 and our recoveries from tenants increased 47 million or 6 percentage rent was 41 million in 2004 compared with 45 million in 2003 the reduction was primarily related to renewing anchor tenant leases with minimum rent increases which had a corresponding reduction to percentage rent 

  

our operating expenses increased by 243 million or 13 to 2137 million in 2004 related to increased operating and maintenance costs general and administrative costs and depreciation expense as further described below 

  

our combined operating maintenance and real estate taxes increased by 60 million or 7 during 2004 to 943 million this increase was primarily due to shopping centers acquired in 2004 new developments that only recently began operating and therefore incurred operating expenses for only a portion of the previous year normal increases in operating expenses on the stabilized properties and the cost to repair our shopping centers impacted by hurricanes during 2004 although three hurricanes affected 42 shopping centers in florida all of these centers are currently operating and fully functional our repair costs related to the hurricanes are estimated to be 1 million 

  

index to financial statements our general and administrative expenses were 303 million during 2004 compared with 242 million in 2003 or 25 higher related to an increase in the total number of employees higher costs associated with incentive compensation and costs related to implementing new regulations for public companies imposed by the sarbanesoxley act 

  

our depreciation and amortization expense increased 92 million during the current year primarily related to shopping centers acquired in 2004 and new development properties placed in service during 2004 

  

our net interest expense decreased to 812 million in 2004 from 836 million in 2003 average interest rates on our outstanding debt declined to 593 at december 31 2004 compared with 664 at december 31 2003 the reduction was primarily related to reducing the interest rate spread on the line and issuing 150 million of 495 notes in april 2004 the proceeds of which were used to repay maturing notes that had fixed rates of 74 our average fixed interest rates were 671 at december 31 2004 compared with 754 at december 31 2003 our weighted average outstanding debt during 2004 was 15 billion compared with 14 billion in 2003 

  

we account for profit recognition on sales of real estate in accordance with sfas statement no 66 “accounting for sales of real estate” profits from sales of real estate will not be recognized by us unless i a sale has been consummated ii the buyer’s initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property iii we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership and iv we do not have substantial continuing involvement with the property gains from the sale of operating and development properties includes 189 million in gains from the sale of 41 outparcels for proceeds of 604 million and 205 million for properties sold to joint ventures during 2003 the gains from the sale of operating and development properties included 116 million from the sale of 45 outparcels for proceeds of 530 million and 371 million for properties sold these gains are included in continuing operations rather than discontinued operations because they were either properties that had no operating income or they were properties sold to joint ventures where we have continuing involvement through our minority investment 

  

we review our real estate portfolio for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of an asset we determine whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property’s carrying value to an estimate of fair value based upon methods described in our critical accounting policies in the event a property is impaired we write down the asset to fair value for “heldandused” assets and to fair value less costs to sell for “heldfor sale” assets during 2004 and 2003 we established provisions for loss of 810000 and 20 million respectively to adjust operating properties to their estimated fair values provisions for loss on properties subsequently sold are reclassified to discontinued operations therefore the 20 million recorded in 2003 has been reclassified 

  

income from discontinued operations was 230 million in 2004 related to 17 properties sold to unrelated parties for net proceeds of 1305 million and one property classified as heldforsale income from discontinued operations was 246 million in 2003 related to the operations of shopping centers in 2004 as well as 2003 in compliance with the adoption of statement 144 if we sell an asset in the current year we are required to reclassify its operating income into discontinued operations for all prior periods this practice results in a reclassification of amounts previously reported as continuing operations into discontinued operations our income from discontinued operations is shown net of minority interest of exchangeable partnership units totaling 422937 and 560030 for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

index to financial statements minority interest of preferred units declined 10 million to 198 million in 2004 as a result of the redemptions of preferred units during 2004 and 2003 preferred stock dividends increased 45 million to 86 million in 2004 as a result of the issuance of preferred stock during 2004 and 2003 the proceeds of which were used to redeem preferred units as further described above under equity capital transactions 

  

net income for common stockholders was 1277 million in 2004 compared with 1266 million in 2003 or a 1 increase for the reasons described above diluted earnings per share were 208 in 2004 compared with 212 in 2003 or 2 lower although net income for common stockholders increased 11 million during 2004 the increase was diluted as a result of an increase in weighted average common shares associated with the 67 million common stock offering completed in august 2004 

  

comparison of 2003 to 2002 

  

at december 31 2003 on a combined basis we were operating or developing 265 shopping centers as compared to 262 shopping centers at the end of 2002 at december 31 2003 on a combined basis we were developing 36 properties as compared to 34 properties at the end of 2002 

  

our revenues increased by 234 million or 7 to 3632 million in 2003 this increase was related to changes in occupancy from 915 to 922 in the portfolio of stabilized and development properties growth in releasing rental rates and revenues from new developments commencing operations in 2003 net of a reduction in revenues from properties sold in 2003 our minimum rent increased by 124 million or 5 and our recoveries from tenants increased 43 million or 6 percentage rent was 45 million in 2003 compared with 52 million in 2002 the reduction was primarily related to renewing anchor tenant leases with minimum rent increases which had a corresponding reduction to percentage rent 

  

our operating expenses increased by 203 million or 12 to 1894 million in 2003 our combined operating maintenance and real estate taxes increased by 53 million or 6 during 2003 to 882 million this increase was primarily due to new developments that incurred operating expenses for only a portion of the previous year and general increases in operating expenses on the stabilized properties our general and administrative expenses were 242 million during 2003 compared with 228 million in 2002 or 6 higher a result of general salary and benefit increases our depreciation and amortization expense increased 67 million related to new development properties placed in service during 2003 

  

our net interest expense decreased to 836 million in 2003 from 845 million in 2002 average interest rates on our outstanding debt declined to 664 at december 31 2003 compared with 693 at december 31 2002 primarily due to reductions in the libor rate our average fixed interest rates were 754 at december 31 2003 compared with 751 at december 31 2002 our weighted average outstanding debt during 2003 and 2002 was 14 billion 

  

gains from the sale of operating and development properties were 487 million in 2003 related to the sale of 16 properties for 2999 million and 45 outparcels for 53 million during 2002 we recorded gains of 209 million related to the sale of 12 properties for 1648 million and 35 outparcels for 275 million these gains are included in continuing operations rather than discontinued operations because they were either development properties that had no operating income or they were sold to joint ventures where we have a continuing minority investment 

  

during 2003 and 2002 we recorded provisions for loss on shopping centers related to impairments in value of approximately 20 million and 44 million respectively of which 20 million and 34 million respectively were reclassified to operating income from discontinued operations after the related properties were sold 

  

income from discontinued operations was 246 million in 2003 related to the sale of shopping centers and properties held for sale in 2004 and 2003 income from discontinued operations was 378 million in 2002 related to the sale of shopping centers in 2004 2003 and 2002 as discussed above if we 

  

index to financial statements sell an asset in any reported year we are required to reclassify its operating income into discontinued operations for all reported prior years our operating income and gains on sales from discontinued operations are shown net of minority interest of exchangeable partnership units totaling 560030 and 956491 for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

net income for common stockholders was 1266 million in 2003 compared with 1077 million in 2002 or an 18 increase for the reasons described above diluted earnings per share were 212 in 2003 compared with 184 in 2002 or 15 higher related to the increase in net income offset by an increase in weighted average common shares of 803719 shares 

  

environmental matters 

  

we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations and we are primarily concerned with dry cleaning plants that currently operate or have operated at our shopping centers in the past we believe that the tenants who currently operate plants do so in accordance with current laws and regulations generally we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to environmentally approved systems where available we have applied and been accepted into statesponsored environmental programs we have a blanket environmental insurance policy that covers us against thirdparty liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination we have also placed environmental insurance where possible on specific properties with known contamination in order to mitigate our environmental risk we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on regency’s financial position liquidity or operations however we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies with respect to our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities that any previous owner occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants by the condition of nearby properties or by unrelated third parties or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us 

  

inflation 

  

inflation has remained relatively low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers however substantially all of our longterm leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation such provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rent based on tenants’ gross sales which generally increase as prices rise andor escalation clauses which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices in addition many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years which permits us to seek increased rents upon rerental at market rates most of our leases require tenants to pay their share of operating expenses including commonarea maintenance real estate taxes insurance and utilities thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

market risk 

  

we are exposed to interestrate changes primarily related to the variable interest rate on the line and the refinancing of longterm debt which currently contain fixed interest rates our interestrate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interestrate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we borrow primarily at fixed interest rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interestrate swaps caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate our interestrate risk on a related financial instrument we have no plans to enter into derivative or interestrate transactions for speculative purposes 

  

our interestrate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the table below presents the principal cash flows in thousands weighted average interest rates of remaining debt and the fair value of total debt in thousands by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interestrate changes 

  

   

as the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2004 it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date moreover because firm commitments are not presented in the table above the information presented above has limited predictive value as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interestrate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at that time and actual interest rates

item 1  business
operating and investment philosophy
         regency is a qualified real estate investment trust reit which
began operations in 1993 our primary operating and investment goal is longterm
growth in earnings per share and total shareholder return by focusing on a
strategy of owning and operating grocery anchored shopping centers that are
anchored by marketleading supermarkets and that are located in areas with
attractive demographics

         currently our real estate investments before depreciation total 32
billion with 265 shopping centers in 22 states at december 31 2003 our gross
leasable area gla totaled 303 million square feet and was 922 leased
geographically 196 of our gla is located in florida 195 in california
168 in texas 66 in georgia 63 in ohio and 312 spread throughout 17
other states we own and operate our shopping centers through our operating
partnership regency centers lp rclp in which we currently own 98 of
the operating partnership units regencys operating investing and financing
activities are generally performed by rclp

         we earn revenues and generate operating cash flow by leasing space to
grocers and retail sideshop tenants in our shopping centers we experience
growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates at currently owned
shopping centers and by developing new shopping centers a neighborhood center
is a convenient costeffective distribution platform for food retailers
grocery anchored centers generate substantial daily traffic and offer
sustainable competitive advantages to their tenants this high traffic generates
increased sales thereby driving higher occupancy rental rates and rentalrate
growth for regency which we expect to sustain our growth in earnings per share
and increase the value of our portfolio over the long term

         we seek a range of strong national regional and local specialty
tenants for the same reason that we choose to anchor our centers with leading
grocers we have created a formal partnering process  the premier customer
initiative pci  to promote mutually beneficial relationships with our
nongrocer specialty retailers the objective of pci is for regency to build a
base of specialty tenants who represent the bestinclass operators in their
respective merchandising categories such tenants reinforce the consumer appeal
and other strengths of a centers grocery anchor help to stabilize a centers
occupancy reduce releasing downtime reduce tenant turnover and yield higher
sustainable rents

         we primarily grow our shopping center portfolio through new shopping
center development where we acquire the land and construct the building
development is customerdriven meaning we generally have an executed lease from
the anchor before we start construction developments serve the growth needs of
our grocery and specialty retail customers result in modern shopping centers
with longterm leases from the grocery anchors and produce attractive returns on
our invested capital this development process can require up to 36 months from
initial land or redevelopment acquisition through construction leaseup and
stabilization of rental income depending upon the size of the project
generally anchor tenants begin operating their stores prior to construction
completion of the entire center resulting in rental income during the
development phase

         we intend to maintain a conservative capital structure to fund our
growth programs without compromising our investmentgrade ratings our approach
is founded on our selffunding business model this model utilizes center
recycling as a key component our recycling strategy calls for us to redeploy
the proceeds from the sales
page

of properties into new higher quality developments that we expect to generate
sustainable revenue growth and more attractive returns on invested capital our
commitment to maintaining a highquality shopping center portfolio dictates that
we continually assess the value of all of our properties and sell those that no
longer meet our longterm investment standards

         joint venturing of shopping centers also provides us with a capital
source for new development as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset
and property management services as asset manager we are engaged by our
partners to apply similar operating investment and capital strategies to the
portfolios owned by the joint ventures joint ventures grow their shopping
center investments through acquisitions from third parties or direct purchases
of shopping centers from regency although selling properties to joint ventures
reduces our ownership interest we continue to share in the risks and rewards of
centers that meet our longterm investment strategy regency is not subject to
liability and has no obligations or guarantees of the joint ventures beyond its
ownership percentage

risk factors relating to ownership of regency common stock

         we are subject to certain business risks that could affect our industry
which include among others

o    increased competition from supercenters such as walmart could result in
     grocery anchor closings or consolidations in the grocery store industry
     which could reduce our cash flow

o    a slow down in our shopping center development program would reduce our
     operating revenues and gains from sales

o    the bankruptcy or insolvency of or a downturn in the business of any of
     our major tenants could reduce our cash flow

o    the possibility that major tenants will not renew their leases as they
     expire or renew at lower rental rates could reduce our cash flow

o    the internet and ecommerce could reduce the demand for tenants to occupy
     our shopping centers

o    vacant anchor space could affect the entire shopping center because of the
     loss of the anchors customer drawing power

o    poor market conditions could create an over supply of space or a reduction
     in demand for our shopping centers

o    risks relating to leverage including uncertainty that we will be able to
     refinance our indebtedness and the risk of higher interest rates

o    our inability to satisfy our cash requirements from operations and the
     possibility that we may be required to borrow funds to meet distribution
     requirements in order to maintain our qualification as a reit

o    potential liability for unknown or future environmental matters and costs
     of compliance with the americans with disabilities act

o    the risk of uninsured losses and

o    unfavorable economic conditions could also result in the inability of
     tenants in certain retail sectors to meet their lease obligations and could
     adversely affect our ability to attract and retain desirable tenants



                                       2

compliance with governmental regulations

         under various federal state and local laws ordinances and
regulations we may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate certain
hazardous or toxic substances at our shopping centers these laws often impose
liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for
the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances the cost of required
remediation and the owners liability for remediation could exceed the value of
the property andor the aggregate assets of the owner the presence of such
substances or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely
affect the owners ability to sell or rent the property or borrow using the
property as collateral we have a number of properties that could require or are
currently undergoing varying levels of environmental remediation environmental
remediation is not currently expected to have a material financial effect on us
due to reserves for remediation insurance programs designed to mitigate the
cost of remediation and various stateregulated programs that shift the
responsibility and cost to the state

competition

         we are among the largest publiclyheld owners of groceryanchored
shopping centers in the nation based on revenues number of properties gross
leaseable area and market capitalization there are numerous companies and
private individuals engaged in the ownership development acquisition and
operation of shopping centers which compete with us in our targeted markets
this results in competition for attracting grocery anchor tenants as well as
the acquisition of existing shopping centers and new development sites we
believe that the principal competitive factors in attracting tenants in our
market areas are location demographics rental costs tenant mix property age
and maintenance we believe that our competitive advantages include our
locations within our market areas our strong demographics surrounding our
shopping centers our relationships with our grocery anchor tenants and
sideshop retailers our pci program which allows us to provide retailers with
multiple locations our practice of maintaining and renovating of our shopping
centers and our ability to source and develop new shopping centers

changes in policies

         our board of directors establishes the policies that govern our
investment and operating strategies including among others development and
acquisition of shopping centers tenant and market focus debt and equity
financing policies quarterly distributions to shareholders and reit tax
status the board of directors may amend these policies at any time without a
vote of our shareholders

employees

         our headquarters are located at 121 west forsyth street suite 200
jacksonville florida we presently maintain nineteen offices in thirteen states
where we conduct management leasing construction and investment activities

with our employees are good

         we intend to pay regular quarterly distributions to our common
stockholders future distributions will be declared and paid at the discretion
of our board of directors and will depend upon cash generated by operating
activities our financial condition capital requirements annual distribution
requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as
amended and such other factors as our board of directors deem relevant we
anticipate that for the foreseeable future cash available for distribution will
be greater than earnings and profits due to noncash expenses primarily
depreciation and amortization to be incurred by us distributions by us to the
extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income
tax purposes will be taxable to stockholders as either ordinary dividend income
or capital gain income if so declared by us distributions in excess of earnings
and profits generally will be treated as a nontaxable return of capital such
distributions have the effect of deferring taxation until the sale of a
stockholders common stock in order to maintain our qualification as a reit we
must make annual distributions to stockholders of at least 90 of our taxable
income under certain circumstances which we do not expect to occur we could
be required to make distributions in excess of cash available for distributions
in order to meet such requirements we currently maintain the regency centers
corporation dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan which enables our
stockholders to automatically reinvest distributions as well as make voluntary
cash payments towards the purchase of additional shares

         under our loan agreement for our line of credit distributions may not
exceed 95 of funds from operations ffo based on the immediately preceding
four quarters ffo is defined in accordance with the nareit definition available
on their website at wwwnareitcom also in the event of any monetary default
we may not make distributions to stockholders

item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and
         results of operations

introduction and strategic overview

         regency is a qualified real estate investment trust reit which
began operations in 1993 our primary operating and investment goal is longterm
growth in earnings per share and total shareholder return by focusing on a
strategy of owning and operating grocery anchored shopping centers that are
anchored by marketleading supermarkets and that are located in areas with
attractive demographics

         currently our real estate investments before depreciation total 32
billion with 265 shopping centers in 22 states at december 31 2003 our gross
leasable area gla totaled 303 million square feet and was 922 leased
geographically 196 of our gla is located in florida 195 in california
168 in texas 66 in georgia 63 in ohio and 312 spread throughout 17
other states we own and operate our shopping centers through our operating
partnership regency centers lp rclp in which we currently own 98 of
the operating partnership units regencys operating investing and financing
activities are generally performed by rclp

         we earn revenues and generate operating cash flow by leasing space to
grocers and retail sideshop tenants in our shopping centers we experience
growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates at currently owned
shopping centers and by developing new shopping centers a neighborhood center
is a convenient costeffective distribution platform for food retailers
grocery anchored centers generate substantial daily traffic and offer
sustainable competitive advantages to their tenants this high traffic generates
increased sales thereby driving higher occupancy rental rates and rentalrate
growth for regency which we expect to sustain our growth in earnings per share
and increase the value of our portfolio over the long term

         we seek a range of strong national regional and local specialty
tenants for the same reason that we choose to anchor our centers with leading
grocers we have created a formal partnering process  the premier customer
initiative pci  to promote mutually beneficial relationships with our
nongrocer specialty retailers the objective of pci is for regency to build a
base of specialty tenants who represent the bestinclass operators in their
respective merchandising categories such tenants reinforce the consumer appeal
and other strengths of a centers grocery anchor help to stabilize a centers
occupancy reduce releasing downtime reduce tenant turnover and yield higher
sustainable rents

         we primarily grow our shopping center portfolio through new shopping
center development where we acquire the land and construct the building
development is customerdriven meaning we generally have an executed lease from
the anchor before we start construction developments serve the growth needs of
our grocery and specialty retail customers result in modern shopping centers
with longterm leases from the grocery anchors and produce attractive returns on
our invested capital this development process can require up to 36 months from
initial land or redevelopment acquisition through construction leaseup and
stabilization of rental income depending upon the size of the project
generally anchor tenants begin operating their stores prior to construction
completion of the entire center resulting in rental income during the
development phase

         we intend to maintain a conservative capital structure to fund our
growth programs without compromising our investmentgrade ratings our approach
is founded on our selffunding business model this model utilizes center
recycling as a key component our recycling strategy calls for us to redeploy
the proceeds from the sales of properties into new higher quality developments
that we expect to generate sustainable revenue growth and more attractive
returns on invested capital our commitment to maintaining a highquality
shopping center portfolio dictates that we continually assess the value of all
of our properties and sell those that no longer meet our longterm investment
standards

         joint venturing of shopping centers also provides us with a capital
source for new development as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset
and property management services as asset manager we are engaged by our
partners to apply similar operating investment and capital strategies to the
portfolios owned by the joint ventures joint ventures grow their shopping
center investments through acquisitions from third parties or direct purchases
of shopping centers from regency although selling properties to joint ventures
reduces our ownership interest we continue to share in the risks and rewards of
centers that meet our longterm investment strategy regency is not subject to
liability and has no obligations or guarantees of the joint ventures beyond its
ownership percentage

         we have identified certain significant risks and challenges affecting
our industry and we are addressing them accordingly a further economic
downturn could result in declines in occupancy levels at our shopping centers
which would reduce our rental revenues however we believe that our investment
focus on grocery anchored shopping centers that provide daily necessities will
minimize the impact of a downturn in the economy increased competition from
supercenters such as walmart could result in grocery anchor closings or
consolidations in the grocery store industry we currently have 37 shopping
centers less than 15 of our portfolio that operate within three miles of a
supercenter and we closely monitor their performance and tenants sales a slow
down in our shopping center development program would reduce operating revenues
and gains from sales we believe that developing shopping centers in markets
with strong demographics with leading grocery stores will enable us to continue
to maintain our development program at historical averages

general

         we expect that cash generated from revenues will provide the necessary
funds on a shortterm basis to pay our operating expenses interest expense
scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness recurring capital
expenditures necessary to maintain our shopping centers properly and
distributions to stock and unit holders net cash provided by operating
activities was 2279 million 1887 million and 1859 million for the years
ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively during 2003 2002 and
2001 we incurred capital expenditures of 135 million 150 million and 118
million to maintain our shopping centers paid scheduled principal payments of
135 million 56 million and 61 million to our lenders and paid dividends
and distributions of 1579 million 1585 million and 1544 million to our
share and unit holders respectively

         although base rent is supported by longterm lease contracts tenants
who file bankruptcy are able to cancel their leases and close the related
stores in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our
shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases we could experience a
significant reduction in our revenues we are not currently aware of any current
or pending bankruptcy of any of our tenants that would cause a significant
reduction in our revenues and no tenant represents more than 10 of our annual
base rental revenues

         we expect to meet longterm capital requirements for maturing preferred
units and debt the acquisition of real estate and the renovation or
development of shopping centers from i residual cash generated from operating
activities after the payments described above ii proceeds from the sale of
real estate iii joint venturing of real estate iv refinancing of debt and
v equity raised in the private or public markets additionally the company
has the right to call and repay at par outstanding preferred units five years
after their issuance date at the companys discretion

         we intend to continue to grow our portfolio through new development and
acquisitions either directly or through our joint venture relationships
because development and acquisition activities are discretionary in nature they
are not expected to burden the capital resources we have currently available for
liquidity requirements capital necessary to complete developmentsinprocess
are funded from our line of credit regency expects that cash provided by
operating activities unused amounts available under our line of credit and cash
reserves are adequate to meet shortterm and committed longterm liquidity
requirements

shopping center development acquisitions and sales

         at december 31 2003 we had 36 projects under construction or
undergoing major renovations which when completed we expect to represent an
investment of 6939 million before the estimated reimbursement of certain
tenantrelated costs and projected sales proceeds from adjacent land and
outparcels of 1227 million costs necessary to complete these developments
will be 2731 million are generally already committed as part of existing
construction contracts and will be expended through 2006 these developments
are approximately 61 complete and 76 preleased the costs necessary to
complete these developments will be funded from our line of credit which has a
commitment amount of 600 million and a balance of 1950 million at december
31 2003 during 2003 we started 3003 million of new development based on
total costs that we expect to expend on these 18 centers through completion
during 2002 we started 3355 million of new development representing 21
centers

         during 2003 we acquired four operating properties from third parties
for 754 million representing 24 of our consolidated assets at december 31
2003 these properties were acquired in existing investment markets are grocery
anchored and are owned entirely by regency comparatively we acquired five
operating properties during 2002 for 1067 million or 35 of consolidated
assets at december 31 2002 these acquisitions did not have a significant
impact on operations during 2003 and 2002

         during 2003 we sold 18 retail centers to third parties for 1707
million compared with 41 retail centers sold for 3391 million during 2002 as
part of our asset recycling program of the centers sold in 2003 14 were
operating during 2003 and are included in discontinued operations in our
accompanying consolidated statements of operations all 41 centers sold during
2002 were operating and are included in discontinued operations we also sold
partial interests in 12 properties both in 2003 and 2002 to joint ventures for
2329 million and 1648 million respectively discussed further below under
investments in real estate partnerships we have an inventory of land
outparcels adjacent to our shopping centers that we routinely develop lease
or sell during 2003 sales related to outparcels were 557 million compared
to 318 million in 2002 total gains from sales of real estate included in
continuing operations and discontinued operations were 647 million in 2003
compared with 370 million in 2002

         investments in new developments and acquisitions and proceeds from the
sale of properties to third parties or partial sales to joint ventures are
included in investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of
cash flows net cash used in investing activities was 962 million for the year
ended december 31 2003 this compares with net cash provided by investing
activities of 950 million in 2002 and net cash used in investing activities of
1641 million in 2001

         mortgage loans are secured and may be prepaid but could be subject to
yield maintenance premiums mortgage loans are generally due in monthly
installments of interest and principal and mature over various terms through
2023 variable interest rates on mortgage loans are currently based on libor
plus a spread in a range of 125 to 150 basis points fixed interest rates on
mortgage loans range from 565 to 95

dependent upon maintaining specific investmentgrade ratings we are also
required to comply and are in compliance with certain financial and other
covenants customary with this type of unsecured financing the line is used
primarily to finance the development of real estate but is also available for
general working capital purposes the line matures on april 30 2004 but

         we are exposed to capital market risk such as changes in interest
rates in order to manage the volatility related to interestrate risk we
originate new debt with fixed interest rates or we consider entering into
interestrate hedging arrangements at december 31 2003 84 of our total debt
had fixed interest rates compared with 92 in 2002 we intend to limit the
percentage of variable interest rate debt to be no more than 30 of total debt
which we believe to be an acceptable risk based upon the variable interestrate
debt outstanding at december 31 2003 if variable interest rates were to
increase by 1 our annual interest expense would increase by 24 million we
do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative
purposes we account for derivative instruments under statement of financial
accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities as amended statement 133

         we have 200 million of 74 unsecured debt maturing april 1 2004 we
currently expect to refinance at least 150 million with comparable securities
at the maturity date with terms up to 10 years but at a lower fixed interest
rate and repay any remaining amounts from the line in july and september 2003
we entered into two forwardstarting interestrate swaps of 965 million and
477 million respectively we designated the aggregate 1442 million swaps as
a hedge to fix the rate on our financing which we expect to complete on april
1 2004 the fair value of the swaps was an asset of 174747 as of december 31
2003 and is recorded in other assets in our accompanying consolidated balance
sheet the swaps qualify for hedge accounting under statement 133 therefore we
record changes in fair value through other comprehensive income no hedge
ineffectiveness has been incurred or recognized to date on these swaps amounts
that we have reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to these
swaps will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on
the related debt

         on august 18 2003 we issued 3600000 shares of common stock at
3596 per share in a public offering the proceeds of 1295 million net of
offering costs were used to redeem 80 million or 100 of the series a
preferred units and to reduce the outstanding balance of the line at the time
of the redemption 12 million of previously deferred costs related to the
original preferred units issuance were expensed in the consolidated statement
of operations as a component of minority interest preferred units

         on june 24 2003 we purchased 4606880 shares of common stock for
150 million from security capital pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement
dated june 11 2003 the purchase was funded from the line

         on april 3 2003 we received proceeds from a 75 million offering of
3000000 depositary shares representing series 3 cumulative redeemable
preferred stock the depositary shares are not convertible into common stock of
the company and are redeemable at par upon regencys election on or after april
3 2008 pay a 745 annual dividend and have a liquidation value of 25 per
depositary share

         in march 2003 we redeemed 35 million of series c 9 preferred units
and 40 million of series e 875 preferred units in a negotiated transaction
the redemptions were portions of each series and we paid a 1 premium on the
face value of the redeemed units totaling 750000 at the time of redemption
the premium and 19 million of previously deferred costs related to the
original preferred units issuance were expensed in the consolidated statement
of operations as a component of minority interest of preferred units the
redemption was funded from proceeds from the line

         we have issued preferred units in various amounts since 1998 the net
proceeds of which we used to reduce the balance of the line we sold the issues
primarily to institutional investors in private placements the preferred units
which may be called by us after certain dates ranging from 2004 to 2005 have no
stated maturity or mandatory redemption and they pay a cumulative quarterly
dividend at fixed rates ranging from 875 to 9125 at any time after 10 years
from the date of issuance the preferred units may be exchanged by the holders
for cumulative redeemable preferred stock at an exchange rate of one share for
one unit the preferred units and the related preferred stock are not
convertible into regency common stock at december 31 2003 and 2002 the face
value of total preferred units issued was 229 million and 384 million
respectively with an average fixed distribution rate of 888 and 872
respectively included in preferred units are original issuance costs of 55
million that will be expensed as the underlying preferred units are redeemed in
the future

         in summary net cash used in financing activities related to the debt
and equity activity discussed above was 1582 million 2550 million and 949
million for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively

critical accounting policies and estimates


         knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete
understanding of our financial results and discussions and analysis of these
results the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make
certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities at a
financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a
financial reporting period these accounting estimates are based upon our
judgments and are considered to be critical because of their significance to the
financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from
those judgments or that the use of different assumptions could result in
materially different estimates we review these estimates on a periodic basis to
ensure reasonableness however the amounts we may ultimately realize could
differ from such estimates

         capitalization of costs  we have an investment services group with an
established infrastructure that supports the due diligence land acquisition
construction leasing and accounting of our development properties all direct
costs related to these activities are capitalized included in these costs are
interest and real estate taxes incurred during construction as well as
estimates for the portion of internal costs that are incremental and deemed
directly or indirectly related to our development activity if future accounting
standards limit the amount of internal costs that may be capitalized or if our
development activity were to decline significantly without a proportionate
decrease in internal costs we could incur a significant increase in our
operating expenses

         valuation of real estate investments  our longlived assets primarily
real estate held for investment are carried at cost unless circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable we review
longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate such an evaluation is warranted the review involves a number of
assumptions and estimates used to determine whether impairment exists depending
on the asset we use varying methods such as i estimating future cash flows
ii determining resale values by market or iii applying a capitalization rate
to net operating income using prevailing rates in a given market these methods
of determining fair value can fluctuate significantly as a result of a number of
factors including changes in the general economy of those markets in which we
operate tenant credit quality and demand for new retail stores if we determine
that impairment exists due to our inability to recover an assets carrying
value a provision for loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value
exceeds estimated fair value

         discontinued operations  the application of current accounting
principles that govern the classification of any of our properties as held for
sale on the balance sheet or the presentation of results of operations and
gains on the sale of these properties as discontinued requires management to
make certain significant judgments in evaluating whether a property meets the
criteria set forth by financial accounting standards board fasb statement
no 144 accounting for the impairment and disposal of longlived assets
statement 144 the company makes a determination as to the point in time
that it can be reasonably certain that a sale will be consummated given the
nature of all real estate sales contracts it is not unusual for such contracts
to allow potential buyers a period of time to evaluate the property prior to
formal acceptance of the contract in addition certain other matters critical
to the final sale such as financing arrangements often remain pending even
upon contract acceptance as a result properties under contract may not close
within the expected time period if at all due to these uncertainties it is
not likely that the company can meet the criteria of statement 144 prior to the
sale formally closing therefore any properties categorized as held for sale
represent only those properties that management has determined are probable to
close within the requirements set forth in statement 144 the company also makes
judgments regarding the extent of involvement it will have with a property
subsequent to its sale in order to determine if the results of operations and
gainloss on sale should be reflected as discontinued consistent with statement
144 any property sold to an entity in which the company has significant
continuing involvement most often joint ventures are not considered to be
discontinued in addition any property which the company sells to an unrelated
third party but retains a property or asset management function is also not
considered discontinued thus only properties sold or to be sold to unrelated
third parties for which the company in its judgment has no continuing
involvement are classified as discontinued

         income tax status  the prevailing assumption underlying the operation
of our business is that we will continue to operate so as to qualify as a reit
defined under the internal revenue code we are required to meet certain income
and asset tests on a periodic basis to ensure that we continue to qualify as a
reit as a reit we are allowed to reduce taxable income by all or a portion of
our distributions to stockholders we evaluate the transactions that we enter
into and determine their impact on our reit status determining our taxable
income calculating distributions and evaluating transactions requires us to
make certain judgments and estimates as to the positions we take in our
interpretation of the internal revenue code because many types of transactions
are susceptible to varying interpretations under federal and state income tax
laws and regulations our positions are subject to change at a later date upon
final determination by the taxing authorities

new accounting pronouncements


        in december 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 fin 46
revised december 2003 fin 46r consolidation of variable interest
entities which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it
has controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting
rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity fin 46r replaces fin 46
which was issued in january 2003 fin 46r is applicable immediately to a
variable interest entity created after january 31 2003 and as of the first
interim period ending after march 15 2004 to those variable interest entities
created before february 1 2003 and not already consolidated under fin 46 in
previously issued financial statements we did not create any variable interest
entities after january 31 2003 we have analyzed the applicability of this
interpretation to our structures created before february 1 2003 and we do not
believe its adoption will have a material effect on our results of operations

        in may 2003 the fasb issued statement of accounting standards no 150
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both
liabilities and equity statement 150 statement 150 affects the accounting
for certain financial instruments including requiring companies having
consolidated entities with specified termination dates to treat minority
owners interests in such entities as liabilities in an amount based on the
fair value of the entities although statement 150 was originally effective
july 1 2003 the fasb has indefinitely deferred certain provisions related to
classification and measurement requirements for mandatorily redeemable
financial instruments that become subject to statement 150 solely as a result
of consolidation including minority interests of entities with specified
termination dates as a result statement 150 has no impact on the companys
consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31 2003

        at december 31 2003 we held a majority interest in five consolidated
entities with specified termination dates ranging from 2012 to 2049 the
minority owners interests in these entities are to be settled upon termination
by distribution of either cash or specific assets of the underlying entities
the estimated fair value of minority interests in these entities was 85
million as compared to the carrying value of 47 million we have no other
financial instruments that currently are affected by statement 150

results from operations


comparison of 2003 to 2002

         at december 31 2003 we were operating or developing 265 shopping
centers we identify our shopping centers as either development properties or
stabilized properties development properties are defined as properties that are
in the construction and initial leaseup process and are not yet fully leased
fully leased generally means greater than 93 leased or occupied stabilized
properties are those properties that are generally greater than 93 leased and
if they were developed are more than three years beyond their original
development start date at december 31 2003 we had 229 stabilized shopping
centers that were 954 leased

         our revenues increased by 240 million or 7 to 3776 million in
2003 this increase was related to changes in occupancy from 915 to 922 for
the combined portfolio of stabilized and development properties growth in
releasing rental rates and revenues from new developments commencing
operations in 2003 net of a reduction in revenues from properties sold in
2003 our rental rates grew by 95 from renewal leases and new leases replacing
previously occupied spaces in the stabilized properties in addition to
collecting minimum rent from our tenants for the gla that they lease from us we
also collect contingent rent based upon tenant sales which we refer to as
percentage rent tenants are also responsible for reimbursing us for their
prorata share of the expenses associated with operating our shopping centers
in 2003 our minimum rent increased by 127 million or 5 and our recoveries
from tenants increased 46 million or 6 percentage rent was 45 million in
2003 compared with 52 million in 2002 the reduction primarily related to
renewing anchor tenant leases with minimum rent increases which had a
corresponding reduction to percentage rent


page

         our operating expenses increased by 209 million or 12 to 1969
million in 2003 our combined operating maintenance and real estate taxes
increased by 57 million or 7 during 2003 to 930 million this increase
was primarily due to new developments that incurred operating expenses for only
a portion of the previous year and general increases in operating expenses on
the stabilized properties our general and administrative expenses were 242
million during 2003 compared with 228 million in 2002 or 6 higher a result
of general salary and benefit increases our depreciation and amortization
expense increased 69 million during the current year related to new
development properties placed in service during 2003

         our net interest expense decreased to 840 million in 2003 from 842
million in 2002 average interest rates on our outstanding debt declined to
664 at december 31 2003 compared with 693 at december 31 2002 primarily
due to reductions in the libor rate our average fixed interest rates were 754
at december 31 2003 compared with 751 at december 31 2002 our weighted
average outstanding debt during 2003 was 1436 billion compared with 1392
billion in 2002

         we account for profit recognition on sales of real estate in accordance
with fasb statement no 66 accounting for sales of real estate profits from
sales of real estate will not be recognized by us unless a sale has been
consummated the buyers initial and continuing investment is adequate to
demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property we have transferred to the
buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership and we do not have substantial
continuing involvement with the property gains from the sale of operating and
development properties were 487 million in 2003 related to the sale of 16
properties for 2999 million during 2002 we recorded gains of 209 million
related to the sale of 12 properties for 1648 million these gains are
included in continuing operations rather than discontinued operations because
they were either development properties that had no operating income or they
were sold to joint ventures where we have a continuing minority investment

         we review our real estate portfolio for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the
carrying amount of an asset we determine whether impairment has occurred by
comparing the propertys carrying value to an estimate of fair value based upon
methods described in our critical accounting policies in the event a property
is impaired we write down the asset to fair value for heldandused assets
and to fair value less costs to sell for heldforsale assets during the
years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 we recorded provisions for losses of
approximately 20 million and 44 million respectively of which 719345 and
33 million respectively were reclassed to operating income from discontinued
operations after the related properties were sold

         our income from discontinued operations was 196 million in 2003
related to 14 centers sold to third parties for 1037 million which produced
gains on sale of 160 million in compliance with the adoption of sfas no 144
accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets statement
144 in january 2002 if we sell an asset in the current year we are required
to reclassify its operating income into discontinued operations for all prior
periods this practice results in a reclassification of amounts previously
reported as continuing operations into discontinued operations reclassified
operating income from discontinued operations was 148 million in 2002
compared with 100 million previously reported for 2002 a result of
reclassifying the historical operations of the properties sold in 2003 during
2002 we sold 41 properties for 3391 million to third parties which resulted
in a gain of 161 million our operating income and gains on sales from
discontinued operations are shown net of minority interest of exchangeable
partnership units totaling 461568 and 782799 for the years ended december
31 2003 and 2002 respectively

         net income for common stockholders was 1266 million in 2003 compared
with 1077 million in 2002 or an 18 increase for the reasons previously
discussed diluted earnings per share were 212 in 2003 compared with 184 in
2002 or 15 higher related to the increase in net income offset by an increase
in weighted average common shares of 803719 shares

comparison of 2002 to 2001

         at december 31 2002 we were operating or developing 262 shopping
centers and we had 228 stabilized shopping centers that were 948 leased our
revenues increased 349 million or 11 to 3537 million in 2002 this
increase was due primarily to growth in releasing rental rates and revenue from
new developments commencing operations in 2002 net of a reduction in revenues
from properties sold in 2002 our rental rates grew by 108 our minimum rent
increased by 235 million or 10 and our recoveries from tenants increased by
83 million or 12 our percentage rent was 52 million in 2002 compared with
56 million in 2001 the reduction primarily related to renewing anchor tenant
leases with minimum rent increases which had a corresponding reduction to
percentage rent and in certain cases reduced tenant sales

         our operating expenses increased by 118 million or 7 to 1761
million in 2002 our combined operating maintenance and real estate taxes
increased by 84 million or 11 during 2002 to 873 million the increase
was primarily due to new developments that incurred expenses for only a portion
of the previous year and general increases in operating expenses on our
stabilized properties our general and administrative expenses were 228
million during 2002 compared with 198 million in 2001 or 15 higher as a
result of opening several branch offices in new markets and general salary and
benefit increases our depreciation and amortization expense increased by 74
million during 2002 related to new development properties placed in service
during 2002 and initial depreciation of operating properties previously
classified as held for sale that no longer meet the criteria under statement
144

         gains from the sale of our operating and development properties were
209 million in 2002 related to the sale of 12 properties for 1648 million
during 2001 we recorded gains of 288 million related to the sale of 13
properties for 1230 million these gains are included in continuing operations
rather than discontinued operations because they were either development
properties that had no operating income or they were sold to joint ventures
where we have a continuing minority investment

         our net interest expense increased to 842 million in 2002 from 676
million in 2001 or 25 this increase was primarily due to higher average
outstanding debt balances and lower interest capitalization on new developments
average interest rates on our outstanding debt declined to 693 at december 31
2002 from 727 at december 31 2001

         our income from discontinued operations was 309 million in 2002
compared with 227 million in 2001 income from discontinued operations
includes gains from the sale of properties of 161 million in 2002 as
previously discussed statement 144 was implemented during 2002 and therefore
no gains or losses from the sales of assets in 2001 were reported under
discontinued operations in 2001 operating income and gains on sales included in
discontinued operations are shown net of minority interest of exchangeable
partnership units totaling 782799 and 586856 for the years ended december
31 2002 and 2001 respectively

         net income for common stockholders was 1077 million in 2002 compared
with 977 million in 2001 or a 10 increase for the reasons previously
discussed diluted earnings per share were 184 in 2002 compared with 169 in
2001 or 9 higher as a result of the increase in net income offset by an
increase in weighted average common shares of 1159955 shares

environmental matters


         we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations and we
are primarily concerned with dry cleaning plants that currently operate or have
operated at our shopping centers in the past we believe that the tenants who
currently operate plants do so in accordance with current laws and regulations
generally we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants
from our shopping centers or convert them to environmentally approved systems
where available we have applied and been accepted into statesponsored
environmental programs we have a blanket environmental insurance policy that
covers us against thirdparty liabilities and remediation costs on shopping
centers that currently have no known environmental contamination we have also
placed environmental insurance where possible on specific properties with
known contamination in order to mitigate our environmental risk we believe
that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not
have a material effect on regencys financial position liquidity or
operations however we can give no assurance that existing environmental
studies with respect to our shopping centers have revealed all potential
environmental liabilities that any previous owner occupant or tenant did not
create any material environmental condition not known to us that the current
environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants
and occupants by the condition of nearby properties or by unrelated third
parties or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or
their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to
us

inflation


         inflation has remained relatively low and has had a minimal impact on
the operating performance of our shopping centers however substantially all of
our longterm leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact
of inflation such provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage
rentals based on tenants gross sales which generally increase as prices rise
andor escalation clauses which generally increase rental rates during the
terms of the leases such escalation clauses are often related to increases in
the consumer price index or similar inflation indices in addition many of our
leases are for terms of less than 10 years which permits us to seek increased
rents upon rerental at market rates most of our leases require tenants to pay
their share of operating expenses including common area maintenance real
estate taxes and insurance and utilities thereby reducing our exposure to
increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

market risk


         we are exposed to interestrate changes primarily related to the
variable interest rate on the line of credit and the refinancing of longterm
debt which currently contain fixed interest rates our interestrate risk
management objective is to limit the impact of interestrate changes on earnings
and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these
objectives we borrow primarily at fixed interest rates and may enter into
derivative financial instruments such as interestrate swaps caps and treasury
locks in order to mitigate our interestrate risk on a related financial
instrument we have no plans to enter into derivative or interestrate
transactions for speculative purposes

         our interestrate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the

groceryanchored strategy

         we focus our investment strategy on groceryanchored retail shopping
centers that are located in attractive trade areas and are anchored by a
dominant grocer in the local market a neighborhood center is a convenient
costeffective distribution platform for food retailers groceryanchored
centers generate substantial daily traffic and offer sustainable competitive
advantages to their tenants this high traffic generates increased sales
thereby driving higher occupancy higher rental rates and higher rental rate
growth for regency  meaning that we can sustain our cash flow growth and
increase the value of our portfolio over the long term

research driven market selection

         groceryanchored centers are best located in neighborhood trade areas
with attractive demographics for a typical regency groceryanchored center we
target a 3mile population of approximately 72000 people with an average
household income in excess of 85000 and a projected 5year population growth
of approximately 8 the trade areas of our centers are growing nearly twice as
fast and household incomes are more than 35 greater than the national averages
translating into more retail buying power once we select specific markets we
seek the best location within the best neighborhoods preferably occupying the
dominant corner close to residential communities with excellent visibility for
our tenants and easy access for neighborhood shoppers

premier customer initiative

         for the same reason we choose to anchor our centers with leading
grocers we also seek a range of strong national regional and local specialty
tenants we have created a formal partnering process  the premier customer
initiative pci  to promote mutually beneficial relationships with our
nongrocer specialty retailers the objective of pci is for regency to build a
base of specialty tenants who represent the bestinclass operators in their
respective merchandising categories such tenants reinforce the consumer appeal
and other strengths of a centers groceryanchor help to stabilize a centers
occupancy reduce releasing downtime lower tenant turnover and yield higher
sustainable rents

customerdriven development

         development is customerdriven meaning we generally have an executed
lease from the anchor before we purchase the land and begin construction
developments serve the growth needs of our grocery and specialty retail
customers result in modern shopping centers with longterm leases from the
groceryanchors and produce attractive returns on invested capital

capital strategy

         we intend to maintain a conservative capital structure designed to fund
our growth programs without compromising our investmentgrade ratings this
approach is founded on our selffunding business model this model utilizes
center recycling as a key component our recycling strategy calls for us to
redeploy the proceeds from the sales of outparcels developments and low
growth lower quality operating properties into new higherquality developments
and acquisitions that we expect will generate sustainable revenue growth and
more attractive returns on invested capital our commitment to maintaining a
highquality portfolio dictates that we continually assess the value of all of
our properties and sell those that no longer meet our longterm investment
standards to third parties joint venturing of assets will also provide regency
with a capital source for new investments and market based fees that we may earn
as the asset manager

risk factors relating to ownership of regency common stock

         we are subject to business risks arising in connection with owning real
estate which include among others

o    the bankruptcy or insolvency of or a downturn in the business of any of
     our major tenants could reduce cash flow

o    the possibility that major tenants will not renew their leases as they
     expire or renew at lower rental rates could reduce cash flow

o    risks related to the internet and ecommerce reducing the demand for
     shopping centers



                                       2
page

o    vacated anchor space will affect the entire shopping center because of the
     loss of the departed anchor tenants customer drawing power

o    poor market conditions could create an over supply of space or a reduction
     in demand for real estate in markets where regency owns shopping centers

o    risks relating to leverage including uncertainty that we will be able to
     refinance our indebtedness and the risk of higher interest rates

o    unsuccessful development activities could reduce cash flow

o    regencys inability to satisfy its cash requirements from operations and
     the possibility that regency may be required to borrow funds to meet
     distribution requirements in order to maintain its qualification as a reit

o    potential liability for unknown or future environmental matters and costs
     of compliance with the americans with disabilities act

o    the risk of uninsured losses and

o    unfavorable economic conditions could also result in the inability of
     tenants in certain retail sectors to meet their lease obligations which
     could adversely affect regencys ability to attract and retain desirable
     tenants

compliance with governmental regulations

         under various federal state and local laws ordinances and
regulations we may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate certain
hazardous or toxic substances at our shopping centers these laws often impose
liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for
the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances the cost of required
remediation and the owners liability for remediation could exceed the value of
the property andor the aggregate assets of the owner the presence of such
substances or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely
affect the owners ability to sell or rent the property or borrow using the
property as collateral we have a number of properties that will require or are
currently undergoing varying levels of environmental remediation these
remediations are not expected to have a material financial effect on regency due
to financial statement reserves insurance programs designed to mitigate the
cost of remediation and various stateregulated programs that shift the
responsibility and cost to the state

competition

         we believe the ownership of shopping centers is highly fragmented
regency faces competition from other reits in the development acquisition
ownership and leasing of shopping centers as well as from numerous local
regional and national real estate developers and owners

changes in policies

         our board of directors establishes the policies that govern our
investment and operating strategies including among others debt and equity
financing policies quarterly distributions to shareholders and reit tax
status the board of directors may amend these policies at any time without a
vote of regencys shareholders

employees

         our headquarters are located at 121 west forsyth street suite 200
jacksonville florida regency presently maintains nineteen offices in thirteen
states where it may conduct management leasing construction and investment
activities at december 31 2002 regency had approximately 387 employees and
believes that relations with its employees are good

          we are focused on building a portfolio of groceryanchored
neighborhood shopping centers that are positioned to withstand adverse economic
conditions by providing consumers with convenient shopping for daily necessities
and adjacent local tenants with foot traffic regencys current investment
markets are stable and we expect to realize growth in net income as a result of
increasing occupancy in the portfolio increasing rental rates development and
acquisition of shopping centers in targeted markets and redevelopment of
existing shopping centers

          the following table summarizes the four largest grocerytenants
occupying our shopping centers including those partially owned through joint
ventures at december 31 2002

         on january 22 2002 kmart corporation a tenant in four of our
shopping centers filed for protection under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy
code under chapter 11 bankruptcy protection kmart has the ability to reject
prepetition lease agreements and cease paying rent kmart rejected two leases
representing 942000 of annual base rent and closed both stores we have two
other leases with kmart representing 883000 of annual base rent both of these
stores are open and operating however we have no assurance that kmart will be
able to continue rental payments on these two stores in the future

         as a result of the kmart store closing at one of our shopping centers
combined with an earlier closing of an adjacent winndixie grocery store we
determined that the value of this shopping center had been permanently impaired
as a result we recorded a provision for loss on operating properties of 24
million during 2002

acquisition and development of shopping centers


         we have implemented a growth strategy dedicated to developing and
acquiring highquality shopping centers our development program makes a
significant contribution to our overall growth development is customerdriven
meaning we generally have an executed lease from the groceryanchor before we
begin construction developments serve the growth needs of our grocery and
specialty retail customers result in modern shopping centers with 20year
leases from the grocery anchors and produce either attractive returns on
invested capital or profits from sale this development process can require 12
to 36 months from initial land or redevelopment acquisition through
construction leaseup and stabilization depending upon the size and type of
project generally anchor tenants begin operating their stores prior to
construction completion of the entire center resulting in rental income during
the development phase

         during 2002 we acquired the land and began development on 21 new
projects representing estimated total costs at completion of 335 million
compared with starting 11 new projects during 2001 with estimated costs at
completion of 156 million at december 31 2002 we had 34 projects under
construction or undergoing major renovations which when completed are
expected to represent an investment of 6358 million before the estimated
reimbursement of certain tenantrelated costs and projected sales proceeds from
adjacent land and outparcels of 131 million costs necessary to complete these
developments will be 326 million are generally already committed as part of
existing construction contracts and will be expended through 2005 these
developments are approximately 49 completed and 64 preleased

         regency has a 20 equity interest in and serves as property manager for

         regency has a 25 equity interest in and serves as property manager for
macquarie countrywideregency llc mcwr a joint venture with an affiliate
of macquarie countrywide trust of australia a sydney australiabased property
trust focused on investing in groceryanchored shopping centers during 2002
mcwr acquired 11 shopping centers from the company for 1452 million for which
the company received net proceeds of 949 million and a note receivable of
251 million mcwr is currently in the process of placing thirdparty
fixedrate mortgages on the properties the proceeds of which will be used to
repay the note receivable in january 2003 the note was reduced by 57
million and we expect the balance of the note receivable to be repaid during
2003 the company recognized gains on these sales of 111 million which
represents 53 million related to operating properties recorded as a gain on
the sale of operating properties and 58 million related to development
properties recorded as service operations revenue the recognition of gain is
recorded on only that portion of the sale to mcwr not attributable to the
companys 25 joint venture interest at december 31 2002 mcwr owned 16
shopping centers with a net book value of 1807 million

         columbia and mcwr intend to continue to acquire retail shopping
centers some of which they may acquire directly from regency for those
properties acquired from third parties regency is required to provide its pro
rata share of the purchase price

liquidity and capital resources


         we expect that the cash generated from revenues will provide the
necessary funds on a shortterm basis to pay our operating expenses interest
expense scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness recurring
capital expenditures necessary to maintain our shopping centers properly and
distributions to stock and unit holders net cash provided by operating
activities was 173 million and 1859 million for the years ended december 31
2002 and 2001 respectively during 2002 and 2001 respectively we incurred
capital expenditures of 185 million and 158 million to improve our shopping
center portfolio paid scheduled principal payments of 56 million and 61
million to our lenders and paid dividends and distributions of 1585 million
and 1544 million to our share and unit holders

         although base rent is supported by longterm lease contracts tenants
who file bankruptcy have the right to cancel their leases and close the related
stores in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our
shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases we could experience a
significant reduction in our revenues we are not currently aware of any current
or pending bankruptcy of any of our tenants that would cause a significant
reduction in our revenues and no tenant represents more than 10 of our annual
baserental revenues

         we expect to meet longterm capital requirements for maturing debt the
acquisition of real estate and the renovation or development of shopping
centers from i cash generated from operating activities after the payments
described above ii proceeds from the sale of real estate iii joint
venturing of real estate iv increases in debt and v equity raised in the
private or public markets additionally the company has the right to call and
repay outstanding preferred units five years after their issuance date at the
companys discretion which could begin during 2003 the sources of repaying
preferred units would include those listed above

         our commitment to maintaining a highquality portfolio dictates that we
continually assess the value of all of our properties and sell to third parties
those operating properties that no longer meet our longterm investment
standards we may also sell a portion of an operating or development property to
one of our joint ventures which may provide regency with a capital source for
new development and acquisitions as well as marketbased fees that we may earn
as the asset manager by selling a property to a joint venture regency owns
less than 100 of the property generally 20 to 50 and shares the risks and
rewards of the property with its partner

         proceeds from the sale or joint venturing of properties are included in
net investing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows during
2002 net proceeds from the sale or joint venturing of real estate was 425
million compared with 142 million during 2001 and were used primarily to
reduce the balance of the unsecured line of credit the line net cash
provided by investing activities was 1106 million for the year ended december
31 2002 and generally means that the net proceeds from the sale or joint
venturing of real estate was greater than the cash invested in new acquisitions
or developments net cash used in investing activities was 1641 million for
the year ended december 31 2001 and generally means that cash invested in new

         mortgage loans are secured by certain real estate properties and may
be prepaid but could be subject to a yieldmaintenance premium mortgage loans
are generally due in monthly installments of interest and principal and mature
over various terms through 2019 variable interest rates on mortgage loans are
currently based on libor plus a spread in a range of 130 basis points to 175
basis points fixed interest rates on mortgage loans range from 664 to 95

         interest rates paid on the line which are based on libor plus 85 at
december 31 2002 and 2001 were 2288 and 2913 respectively the spread that
we pay on the line is dependent upon maintaining specific investmentgrade
ratings we are also required to comply and are in compliance with certain
financial and other covenants customary with this type of unsecured financing
the line is used primarily to finance the acquisition and development of real
estate but is also available for general workingcapital purposes

million related to the acquisition of five properties which includes debt
premiums of 27 million based upon abovemarket interest rates of the debt
instruments debt premiums are being amortized over the terms of the related
debt instruments

any time after 10 years from the date of issuance the preferred units may be
exchanged by the holders for cumulative redeemable preferred stock preferred
stock at an exchange rate of one share for one unit the preferred units and
the related preferred stock are not convertible into regency common stock at
december 31 2002 and 2001 the face value of preferred units issued was 384
million with an average fixed distribution rate of 872

         we intend to continue growing our portfolio through acquisitions and
developments either directly or through our joint venture relationships
because acquisition and development activities are discretionary in nature they
are not expected to burden the capital resources we have currently available for
liquidity requirements regency expects that cash provided by operating
activities unused amounts available under the line and cash reserves are
adequate to meet liquidity requirements

critical accounting policies and estimates


         knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete
understanding of our financial results and discussions and analysis of these
results the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make
certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities at a
financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a
financial reporting period these accounting estimates are based upon our
judgments and are considered to be critical because of their significance to the
financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from
those judgments or that the use of different assumptions could result in
materially different estimates we review these estimates on a periodic basis to
ensure reasonableness however the amounts we may ultimately realize could
differ from such estimates

         capitalization of costs  we have an investment services group with an
established infrastructure that supports the due diligence land acquisition
construction leasing and accounting of our development properties all direct
and indirect costs related to these activities are capitalized included in
these costs are interest and real estate taxes incurred during construction as
well as estimates for the portion of internal costs that are incremental and
deemed directly or indirectly related to our development activity if future
accounting standards limit the amount of internal costs that may be capitalized
or if our development activity were to decline significantly without a
proportionate decrease in internal costs we could incur a significant increase
in our operating expenses

         valuation of real estate investments  our longlived assets primarily
real estate held for investment are carried at cost unless circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable we review
longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate such an evaluation is warranted the review involves a number of
assumptions and estimates used in determining whether impairment exists
depending on the asset we use varying methods such as i estimating future cash
flows ii determining resale values by market or iii applying a
capitalization rate to net operating income using prevailing rates in a given
market these methods of determining fair value can fluctuate up or down
significantly as a result of a number of factors including changes in the
general economy of those markets in which we operate tenant credit quality and
demand for new retail stores if we determine that impairment exists due to the
inability to recover an assets carrying value a provision for loss is recorded
to the extent that the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value

         income tax status  the prevailing assumption underlying the operation
of our business is that we will continue to operate so as to qualify as a reit
defined under the internal revenue code certain income and asset tests are
required to be met on a periodic basis to ensure we continue to qualify as a
reit as a reit we are allowed to reduce taxable income by all or a portion of
our distributions to stockholders as we evaluate each transaction entered into
we determine the impact that these transactions will have on our reit status
determining our taxable income calculating distributions and evaluating
transactions requires us to make certain judgments and estimates as to the
positions we take in our interpretation of the internal revenue code because
many types of transactions are susceptible to varying interpretations under
federal and state income tax laws and regulations our positions are subject to
change at a later date upon final determination by the taxing authorities

results from operations


comparison of 2002 to 2001

         at december 31 2002 we were operating or developing 262 shopping
centers we identify our shopping centers as either development properties or
stabilized properties development properties are defined as properties that are
in the construction and initial leaseup process that are not yet fully leased
fully leased generally means greater than 90 leased and occupied stabilized
properties are those properties that are generally greater than 90 leased and
if they were developed are more than three years beyond their original
development start date at december 31 2002 we had 228 stabilized shopping
centers that were 948 leased

         revenues increased 222 million or 6 to 3802 million in 2002
this increase was due primarily to our realization of a full year of revenues
from new 2001 developments and from growth in rental rates of the operating
properties in 2002 rental rates grew by 108 from renewal leases and new
leases replacing previously occupied spaces in the stabilized properties
minimum rent increased 24 million or 10 and recoveries from tenants
increased 76 million or 11

         service operations revenue includes management fees commission income
and gains or losses from the sale of land and development properties without
significant operations service operations revenue does not include gains or
losses from the sale of nondevelopment operating properties the company
accounts for profit recognition on sales of real estate in accordance with
financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 66 accounting for
sales of real estate profits from sales of real estate will not be recognized
by the company unless a sale has been consummated the buyers initial and
continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the
property the company has transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards
of ownership and the company does not have substantial continuing involvement
with the property

         service operations revenue decreased 112 million to 203 million in
2002 or 36 the decrease was due primarily to the adoption of sfas no 144
accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets statement
144 which requires 156 million of gains related to 2002 sales to be
presented under discontinued operations

         operating expenses increased 159 million or 9 to 1843 million in
2002 combined operating maintenance and real estate taxes increased 87
million or 11 during 2002 to 897 million the increase was primarily due to
new developments that incurred expenses for only a portion of the previous year
and general increases in operating expenses on the stabilized properties
general and administrative expenses were 226 million during 2002 compared with
206 million in 2001 or 10 higher as a result of the company opening several
branch offices in new markets and general salary and benefit increases
depreciation and amortization increased 8 million during 2002 related to higher
acquisition and development activity and the depreciation of operating
properties classified as held for sale in 2001 that no longer met the criteria
under statement 144

         we review our real estate portfolio for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the
carrying amount of an asset regency determines whether impairment has occurred
by comparing the propertys carrying value to an estimate of fair value based
upon the methods described above in our critical accounting policies in the
event the properties are impaired we write down assets to fair value for held
andused assets and fair value less costs to sell for heldforsale assets
during 2002 we recorded a provision for loss of 44 million

         net interest expense increased to 813 million in 2002 from 637
million in 2001 or 28 the increase was primarily due to average outstanding
debt balances during 2002 exceeding 2001 by 131 million and lower interest
capitalization on new developments average interest rates on outstanding debt
declined to 693 at december 31 2002 from 727 at december 31 2001

         income from discontinued operations was 287 million in 2002 compared
with 121 million in 2001 primarily due to 187 million in gains we
recognized on the sale of operating properties and stabilized properties in our
development portfolio operating income and gains on sales in discontinued

comparison of 2001 to 2000

         revenues increased 216 million or 6 to 358 million in 2001 the
increase was due primarily to our realization of a full year of revenues from
new 2000 developments and from growth in rental rates at the operating
properties in 2001 rental rates grew by 105 from renewal leases and new
leases replacing previously occupied spaces in the stabilized properties
minimum rent increased 113 million or 5 and recoveries from tenants

were 954 leased

         service operations revenue increased by 43 million to 315 million
in 2001 or 16 the increase was primarily due to a 124 million increase in
gains from the sale of land and outparcels a 17 million increase in
management fees primarily related to the columbia and mcwr joint ventures
offset by a 98 million reduction in development profits the reduction in
development profits was a result of selling fewer developments during 2001
compared with 2000

         operating expenses increased 152 million or 10 to 1684 million
in 2001 combined operating maintenance and real estate taxes increased 52

new developments that incurred expenses for only a portion of the previous year
and general increases in operating expenses on the stabilized properties
general and administrative expenses were 206 million during 2001 compared with
199 million in 2000 or 3 higher as a result of general salary and benefit
increases depreciation and amortization increased 69 million during 2001 or
12 primarily due to developments that only operated for part of the year
during 2000

         during 2001 and 2000 we recorded a provision for loss on operating
properties held for sale of 16 million and 13 million respectively the
provision in 2000 was directly related to an agreedupon sale price associated
with a contract for sale of seven shopping centers

         interest expense decreased to 637 million in 2001 from 639 million
in 2000 regency had 14 billion and 13 billion of outstanding debt at

stock purchase loans


         in previous years as part of our longterm incentive compensation
plan the company structured stock purchase plans whereby executives could
acquire common stock at fair market value by investing their own capital in
combination with loans provided by regency these interestbearing

fullrecourse loans were secured by stock which was held as collateral by
regency as part of the executives compensation program the company granted
partial forgiveness of the unpaid principal balance based upon specified
performance criteria and the passage of time the company ceased making these
types of loans after 1998 and has not originated any new personal loans to our
employees since that date as of september 30 2002 all participants agreed to
repay the entire balance of their loans outstanding with a portion of the common
shares held as collateral valued at fair market value on that day the company
in return granted the participants restricted stock and stock options that are
intended to provide them with the same level of compensation benefits that they
would have received under existing agreements for specified forgiveness amounts

environmental matters


         regency like others in the commercial real estate industry is subject
to numerous environmental laws and regulations the operation of dry cleaning
plants at our shopping centers is the principal environmental concern we
believe that the tenants who operate these plants do so in accordance with
current laws and regulations and have established procedures to monitor their
operations additionally we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry
cleaning plants from our shopping centers where available we have applied and
been accepted into statesponsored environmental programs we have a blanket
environmental insurance policy that covers regency against thirdparty
liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no
known environmental contamination we have also placed environmental insurance
on specific properties with known contamination in order to mitigate regencys
environmental risk we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known
environmental matters will not have a material effect on regencys financial
position liquidity or operations

inflation


         inflation has remained relatively low and has had a minimal impact on
the operating performance of our shopping centers however substantially all of
our longterm leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact
of inflation such provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage
rentals based on tenants gross sales which generally increase as prices rise
andor escalation clauses which generally increase rental rates during the
terms of the leases such escalation clauses are often related to increases in
the consumer price index or similar inflation indices in addition many of our
leases are for terms of less than 10 years which permits us to seek increased
rents upon rerental at market rates most of our leases require tenants to pay
their share of operating expenses including common area maintenance real
estate taxes and insurance and utilities thereby reducing our exposure to
increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation



item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

market risk


         regency is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of
the line of credit and longterm debt used to maintain liquidity fund capital
expenditures and expand regencys real estate investment portfolio regencys
interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate
changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs to
achieve its objectives regency borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter
into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps caps and
treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related
financial instrument regency has no plans to enter into derivative or interest
rate transactions for speculative purposes

         regencys interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of
techniques the table below presents the principal cash flows in thousands
weighted average interest rates of remaining debt and the fair value of total
debt in thousands by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash
flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes

              and indirect costs clearly associated with the acquisition
              development and construction of real estate projects are
              capitalized as buildings and improvements

              maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend the useful
              lives of the respective assets are reflected in operating and
              maintenance expense the property cost includes the capitalization
              of interest expense incurred during construction based on average
              outstanding expenditures

              depreciation is computed using the straightline method over
              estimated useful lives of up to forty years for buildings and
              improvements term of lease for tenant improvements and three to
              seven years for furniture and equipment

              operating properties held for sale include properties that no
              longer meet the companys longterm investment standards such as
              expected growth in revenue or market dominance once identified
              and marketed for sale these properties are segregated on the
              balance sheet as operating properties held for sale the company
              also develops shopping centers and standalone retail stores for
              resale once completed these developments are also included in
              operating properties held for sale operating properties held for
              sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated
              selling costs depreciation and amortization are suspended during

              properties resulted in net income of 105 million and 68
              million for the years ended december 31 2001 and 2000
              respectively

              the company reviews its real estate portfolio for value impairment
              whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
              carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable regency
              determines impairment based upon the difference between estimated
              sales value less estimated costs to sell and net book value
              during 2001 the company recorded a provision for loss on one
              shopping center of 16 million due to an anchor tenant bankruptcy
              and other tenants continuing to vacate the shopping center upon
              expiration of their leases during 2000 the company recorded a
              provision for loss on operating properties held for sale of 130
              million related to a portfolio of properties under contract for
              sale that no longer met regencys longterm investment standards
              these properties were classified as operating properties held for
              sale at december 31 2000 and depreciation and amortization was
              suspended

       d    income taxes

              the company believes it qualifies and intends to continue to
              qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code the code as
              a reit the company is allowed to reduce taxable income by all or
              a portion of its distributions to stockholders as distributions
              have exceeded taxable income no provision for federal income
              taxes has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial
              statements

              earnings and profits which determine the taxability of dividends
              to stockholders differ from net income reported for financial
              reporting purposes primarily because of different depreciable
              lives and cost bases of the shopping centers and other timing
              differences

3     segments

       the company was formed and currently operates for the purpose of 1
       operating and developing companyowned retail shopping centers retail
       segment and 2 providing services including management fees and
       commissions earned from third parties and development related profits
       and fees earned from the sales of shopping centers outparcels and
       buildtosuit properties to third parties service operations segment
       the companys reportable segments offer different products or services
       and are managed separately because each requires different strategies and
       management expertise there are no intersegment sales or transfers

       the company assesses and measures operating results starting with net
       operating income for the retail segment and revenues for the service
       operations segment and converts such amounts into a performance measure
       referred to as funds from operations ffo the operating results for
       the individual retail shopping centers have been aggregated since all of
       the companys shopping centers exhibit highly similar economic
       characteristics as neighborhood shopping centers and offer similar
       degrees of risk and opportunities for growth ffo as defined by the
       national association of real estate investment trusts consists of net
       income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting
       principles excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales
       of income producing property held for investment plus depreciation and
       amortization of real estate and adjustments for unconsolidated
       investments in real estate partnerships and joint ventures the company
       further adjusts ffo by distributions made to holders of units and
       preferred stock that results in a diluted ffo amount the company
       considers diluted ffo to be the industry standard for reporting the
       operations of reits adjustments for investments in real estate
       partnerships are calculated to reflect diluted ffo on the same basis
       while management believes that diluted ffo is the most relevant and
       widely used measure of the companys performance such amount does not
       represent cash flow from operations as defined by accounting principles
       generally accepted in the united states of america should not be
       considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of the companys
       operating performance and is not indicative of cash available to fund
       all cash flow needs additionally the companys calculation of diluted
       ffo as provided below may not be comparable to similarly titled
       measures of other reits

       the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described
       in note 1 the revenues diluted ffo and assets for each of the
       reportable segments are summarized as follows for the years ended
       december 31 2001 2000 and 1999 assets not attributable to a
       particular segment consist primarily of cash and deferred costs

       security capital and with regard to extraordinary transactions which
       include mergers consolidations sale of a material portion of regencys
       assets issuances of securities in an amount which requires a shareholder
       vote and other similar transactions out of the ordinary course of
       business however the limited exception is itself further qualified
       even with respect to charter and bylaw amendments and extraordinary
       transactions security capital may only vote shares representing
       ownership of 49 of the outstanding regency common stock at its
       discretion any shares owned by security capital in excess of 49 must be
       voted in accordance with the recommendations of regencys board of
       directions or proportionally in accordance with the votes of the
       other holders of regency common stock with regard to extraordinary
       transactions which require a 23rds vote ie where security capital
       could block the outcome if it voted 49 of the stock security capital
       may only vote shares representing ownership of 32 of the outstanding
       regency common stock security capital may vote its shares to elect a
       certain number of nominees to the regency board of directors however
       this right is similarly limited security capital has the right to
       nominate the greater of three directors or the number of directors
       proportionate to its ownership however security capital may not nominate
       more than 49 of the regency board of directors

       the effect of these limitations is such that notwithstanding the fact
       that security capital owns more than a majority of the currently
       outstanding shares of regency common stock security capital may not in
       compliance with the stockholders agreement exercise voting control with
       respect to more than 49 of the outstanding shares of regency and may
       vote those shares in its discretion only with respect to the limited
       matters listed above

on december 14 2001 security capital entered into an agreement with ge capital
pursuant to which assuming consummation an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
ge capital will be merged with and into security capital with security capital
surviving as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of ge capital assuming that
security capital continues in existence following its acquisition by ge capital
regency believes that the stockholders agreement will remain in full force and
effect however regency is not a party to any of the agreements between
security capital and ge capital

8     longterm stock incentive plans

       the company has a longterm omnibus plan the plan pursuant to which
       the board of directors may grant stock and stock options to officers
       directors and other key employees the plan provides for the issuance of
       up to 12 of the companys common shares outstanding not to exceed 85
       million shares stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to
       the stocks fair market value at the date of grant all stock options
       granted have ten year terms and contain vesting terms of one to five
       years from the date of grant

       at december 31 2001 there were approximately 16 million shares
       available for grant under the plan the per share weightedaverage fair
       value of stock options granted during 2001 and 2000 was 232 and 218
       on the date of grant using the black scholes optionpricing model with
       the following weightedaverage assumptions 2001  expected dividend
       yield 73 riskfree interest rate of 52 expected volatility 20 and
       an expected life of 60 years 2000  expected dividend yield 81
       riskfree interest rate of 67 expected volatility 20 and an expected
       life of 60 years the company applies apb opinion no 25 in accounting
       for its plan and accordingly no compensation cost has been recognized
       for its stock options in the consolidated financial statements

       had the company determined compensation cost based on the fair value at
       the grant date for its stock options under sfas no 123 the companys
       net income for common stockholders would have been reduced to the pro

item 1 business

        the real estate business of regency centers corporation  regency was
established in 1963 as a jacksonville  floridabased  operator and developer of
shopping centers  by the early 1990s  regency had developed a successful track
record of developing  owning and operating  neighborhood and community shopping
centers which offered substantial cycleresistant  opportunities for growth in
1993 regency was formed as a florida corporation  completed its initial public
offering nyse reg and became a qualified selfadministered selfmanaged real
estate investment trust reit

        through a series of major strategic acquisitions in 1997 1998 and 1999
regency  expanded  its  development  and  operational  capabilities  to  have  a
nationwide  scope  from  1993 to 2000  regencys  assets  increased  from 154
million to approximately 3 billion with 242 shopping centers in 22 states  the
most  significant  of these  transactions  was regencys  acquisition of pacific
retail trust for  approximately  1157 billion in february 1999 at the date of
the acquisition  pacific retail trust was operating or had under development 71
retail  shopping  centers  representing  84 million sf of gross  leaseable area
gla

        regency previously  operated under the name regency realty  corporation
but changed its name to regency  centers  corporation  in february  2001 to more
appropriately  acknowledge  its  brand  and  position  in  the  shopping  center
industry  regency  invests in retail  shopping  centers through its partnership
interest in regency centers  lp  rclp an operating  partnership in which
regency currently owns  approximately 98 of the outstanding  common partnership
units units the acquisition development operations and financing activity
of regency  including  the issuance of units or  preferred  units is executed by
rclp

        at december 31 2000 regencys gla totals 271 million square feet and
is 953 percent  leased  geographically  235 of regencys  gla is located in
florida  177 in california  15 in texas 92 in georgia 63 in ohio and
283 spread  throughout 17 other states  today  regency  centers is a leading
owner operator and developer of groceranchored  neighborhood shopping centers
with highquality specialty retailers located in prosperous trade areas

        see also footnote 3 segments to the consolidated  financial statements
included herein for a related discussion of the companys business

operating and investment philosophy

        our key  operating  and  investment  objective  is to  create  longterm
shareholder value by

o       focusing on high quality groceranchored neighborhood shopping centers
          in attractive markets

o       maximizing the value of the portfolio through our researchbased
          investment strategies our preferred customer initiative program
          and our customerdriven development program and

o       using conservative  financial  management and our substantial capital
          base to cost effectively access capital to fund our growth

groceranchored strategy

        we  focus  our  investment  strategy  on  groceranchored   neighborhood
shopping  centers that are located in infill  locations or high growth corridors
and are anchored by a dominant  grocer in the local  market  regardless  of the
economic cycle grocer sales have outpaced inflation in 10 of the last 15 years
more  resistant to down cycles by the nature of their  business  marketleading
grocers generate  continuous  consumer traffic to our centers  such significant
traffic  driven by necessity and  convenience  attracts and benefits our centers
and sideshop tenants

                                        1

        the average remaining lease term for regencys  groceranchored  tenants
is 145 years  since these grocers can leverage their  leadership  positions in
their  respective  markets to draw steady traffic  their  commitment to signing
longterm  leases  provides  regency with stability and  sustainability  of cash
flow

        our  groceranchored  centers  are  planned to serve  neighborhoods  and
communities  and their carefully  selected  locations  enable local shoppers to
visit weekly  or even several times a week as a result a neighborhood  center
is a  convenient  costeffective  distribution  platform  for  food  retailers
moreover  a neighborhood  center that is anchored by a leading grocer is highly
resistant to competition from internet  etailers and mass  merchandise  stores
benefiting all of our tenants

        groceranchored  centers  generate  substantial  daily traffic and offer
sustainable competitive advantages to their tenants this high traffic generates
increased  sales  thereby driving higher  occupancy  higher rental rates  and
higher  rental rate  growth for regency  meaning  that we can sustain our cash
flow growth and increase the value of our portfolio over the long term

        ninety percent of regencys  groceranchored centers are anchored by one
of the top three  grocers in their local  markets  our anchor  tenants  include
leading supermarket chains like kroger  publix  safeway and albertsons  with
average annual sales for a regency grocer of 224 million  our grocers outpace
their  respective chain averages by more than 20 percent and generate an average
of more than 14000  shopper  visits  each week  or more than  725000  shopper
visits annually

research driven market selection

        groceranchored  centers are best  located in  neighborhood  trade areas
with attractive  demographics  the typical regency center 3mile  population is
approximately  75000  strong  with an  average  household  income  in excess of
71000 and a projected  5year  population  growth of more than 8 percent  the
trade areas of regencys  centers are growing nearly twice as fast and household
incomes are more than 30 percent greater than the national averages translating
into more retail buying power once specific markets are selected regency seeks
the best  location  within  the best  neighborhoods  preferably  occupying  the
dominant corner close to residential communities with excellent visibility for
our tenants and easy access for neighborhood shoppers

premier customer initiative

        for the same  reason  we  choose  to anchor  our  centers  with  leading
grocers  we also seek a range of strong national  regional and local specialty
tenants  we have created a formal  partnering  process  the premier  customer
initiative  pci   to  promote  mutually  beneficial  relationships  with our
nongrocer specialty  retailers  the objective of pci is for regency to build a
base of specialty tenants who represent the  bestinclass  operators in their
respective merchandising categories  such tenants reinforce the consumer appeal
and other  strengths of a centers  groceranchor  help to stabilize a centers
occupancy  reduce  releasing  downtime  lower tenant turnover and yield higher
sustainable  rents  for these  reasons  regency is  committed  to giving these
premier  tenants all the support they  require to realize  their  expansion  and
profit objectives the pci program does this by partnering with top neighborhood
operators  while they are in the  strategic  stage of  storelocation  planning
regencys  industry  expertise  enables  us to  offer  our  prospective  tenants
current  indepth data on key markets nationwide as well as access to multiple
prime locations in the best shopping centers  and in the top markets  with the
leading  groceranchors  moreover  our  pci  tenants  benefit  from  employing
standardized leases as they contract for space in multiple regency locations

                                        2

customerdriven development

        development is  customerdriven  meaning we have an executed lease from
the anchor in hand before we purchase the land as a result of commitments  from
our anchor tenants  and our  wellestablished  relationships with key specialty
retailers  a  significant  percentage  of the retail space is dedicated  before
construction  begins  developments  serve the growth  needs of our  grocery and
specialty  retail  customers  result in modern  shopping  centers  with 20year
leases from the groceranchors and produce either attractive returns on invested
capital or profits from sale

        our development program significantly  contributed to our overall growth
during the year  in 2000 we  completed  34  shopping  center and  buildtosuit
developments that represented an investment of 236 million  on average  these
newly completed  developments are 96 percent leased at december 31 2000 we had
56 shopping center developments redevelopments  renovations and singletenant
projects still in progress when complete these projects will represent a total
investment of 730 million 418 million of which has already been funded

capital strategy

        we intend to maintain a conservative  capital structure designed to fund
our growth programs without  returning to the equity markets or compromising our
investmentgrade  ratings this approach is founded on our selffunding business
model  which  relies  on  capital  sourced  from   freeandclear   cash  flow
developments for sale dispositions of limitedgrowth nonstrategic assets and
joint ventures we have the financial flexibility to follow this approach  with
a debttototal  asset ratio of approximately 41 percent  an interest  coverage
ratio of 30 times a fixed charge  coverage  ratio of 21 times  and nearly 80
percent of our real estate assets and net operating income being unencumbered by
mortgages

        during 2000 we sold 22  development  properties  that  generated  total
proceeds in excess of 140 million  in addition  in december 2000 we sold two
regency core  development  properties to a joint venture between regency and the
highly  respected  oregon  public  employees  retirement  fund  operf   these
transactions  collectively  yielded  more than 180  million in total  proceeds
which generated 20 million in profits

        the operf joint  venture  represents a major  coinvestment  partnership
that is expected to produce  substantial  benefits for our  company  during the
third  quarter of 2000  we  executed a letter of intent  with the oregon  state
treasury  acting on behalf of operf  to form a  coinvestment  partnership  to
invest in a 300  million  portfolio  of  neighborhood  and  community  shopping
centers the first phase of the joint venture was consummated with the formation
of  columbia  regency  retail  partners  which  purchased  the  two  properties
mentioned  above the final phase of the partnership is expected to close during
the 1st  quarter of 2001  when it will  purchase  three  additional  stabilized
regency  developments  and operf  will  contribute  three  centers  located  in
attractive infill markets the partnership also plans to acquire 150 million of
groceranchored  shopping centers  throughout the united states over the next 12
to 18 months  regency will own 20 percent of the  partnership  and will be paid
asset management fees property management fees and incentive fees

risk factors relating to ownership of regency common stock

        we are subject to certain  business  risks  arising in  connection  with
owning real estate which include among others

o   the bankruptcy or insolvency of or a downturn in the business of any
       of our major tenants could reduce cash flow

o   the possibility that such tenants will not renew their leases as they expire
    or renew at lower rental rates could reduce cash flow

o   risks related to the internet and ecommerce reducing the demand for
       shopping centers

o   vacated anchor space will affect the entire  shopping  center because of the
       loss of the departed anchor tenants customer drawing power

o   poor market  conditions  could create an over supply of space or a reduction
       in demand for real estate in markets where regency owns shopping centers

o   regencys rapid growth could place strains on its resources

o   risks relating to leverage including uncertainty that regency will be
    able to refinance its indebtedness and the risk of higher interest rates

o   unsuccessful development activities could reduce cash flow

o   regencys  inability to satisfy its cash requirements for operations and the
    possibility   that   regency  may  be  required  to  borrow  funds  to  meet
    distribution requirements in order to maintain its qualification as a reit

                                   3
page
risk factors relating to ownership of regency common stock continued

o   potential liability for unknown or future environmental matters and costs of
    compliance with the americans with disabilities act

o   the risk of uninsured losses and

o   unfavorable  economic  conditions  could  also  result in the  inability  of
    tenants  in certain  retail  sectors to meet  their  lease  obligations  and
    otherwise could  adversely  affect  regencys  ability to attract and retain
    desirable tenants

compliance with governmental regulations

        under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations
we may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate  certain hazardous or toxic
substances at our shopping  centers  these laws often impose liability  without
regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for the presence of the
hazardous or toxic substances  the cost of required remediation and the owners
liability  for  remediation  could exceed the value of the  property  andor the
aggregate assets of the owner  the presence of such substances  or the failure
to properly remediate such substances  may adversely affect the owners ability
to sell or rent the property or borrow using the property as collateral we have
a number of  properties  that will require or are currently  undergoing  varying
levels of environmental remediation these remediations are not expected to have
a material  financial  effect on regency due to  financial  statement  reserves
insurance  programs  designed to mitigate  the cost of  remediation  and various
stateregulated programs that shift the responsibility and cost to the state

competition

        we believe  the  ownership  of  shopping  centers is highly  fragmented
regency  faces  competition  from other reits in the  development  acquisition
ownership  and  leasing  of  shopping  centers as well as from  numerous  local

item 7a       quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

market risk

        regency is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its
line of credit and  longterm  debt used to maintain  liquidity and fund capital
expenditures  and expansion of regencys  real estate  investment  portfolio and
operations  regencys  interest rate risk management  objective is to limit the
impact of  interest  rate  changes on  earnings  and cash flows and to lower its
overall borrowing costs to achieve its objectives  regency borrows primarily at
fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest
rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk
on a related financial instrument regency has no plans to enter into derivative
or interest rate  transactions  for  speculative  purposes  and at december 31
2000  regency  did not have any  borrowings  hedged with  derivative  financial
instruments

        regencys interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques
the table below presents the principal amounts maturing in thousands weighted
average  interest rates of remaining  debt and the fair value of total debt in
thousands by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and
sensitivity to interest rate changes

        as the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december
31 2000 it does not consider those  exposures or positions  which could arise
after that date  moreover  because firm  commitments  are not presented in the
table above the information  presented therein has limited predictive value as
a result regencys ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate
fluctuations  will  depend  on the  exposures  that  arise  during  the  period

           of its distributions to stockholders  as distributions have exceeded
           taxable  income  no provision for federal income taxes has been made

           earnings and profits  which determine the taxability of dividends to
           stockholders differ from net income reported for financial reporting
           purposes  primarily  because of different  depreciable lives and cost
           bases of the shopping centers and other timing differences

      d  income taxes continued

           in july 2000 two subsidiaries of the company  regency realty group
           inc rrg and prt development  corporation  prtdc merged with
           rrg being the surviving  entity  rrg is subject to federal and state
           income  taxes  and  files  separate  tax  returns   rrg   including
           historical  amounts  of prtdc  had  taxable  income  of  2245101
           5029438  and 774756 for the years ended december 31 2000 1999
           and 1998 respectively  rrg incurred federal and state income tax of
           890318   2011629   and   223657  in  2000   1999  and  1998
           respectively

           the company and rrg plan to jointly  elect for rrg to be treated as a
           taxable  reit  subsidiary  of the  company as such term is defined in
           section 856l of the code such election if made will be effective
           for the tax year  beginning  january 1 2001  and is not expected to
           impact the tax treatment of either the company or rrg

           at  december  31  2000 and 1999  the net book basis of real  estate
           assets exceeds the tax basis by  approximately  170 million and 197
           million  respectively  primarily due to the difference  between the
           cost basis of the assets  acquired and their carryover basis recorded
           for tax purposes

3    segments

      the company  was formed  and  currently  operates  for the purpose of 1
      operating and developing  company owned retail  shopping  centers  retail
      segment  and 2 providing  services  including  property  management and
      commissions earned from third parties and development related profits and
      fees  earned  from  the  sales  of  shopping  centers  and  build  to suit
      properties to third parties service operations segment  the company had
      previously  operated  four  office  buildings  that were sold  during 1998
      office  buildings  segment  the  companys  reportable  segments  offer
      different  products or services  and are managed  separately  because each
      requires  different  strategies  and  management  expertise  there are no
      material intersegment sales or transfers

      the company  assesses and measures  operating  results  starting  with net
      operating income for the retail and office  buildings  segments and income
      for the  service  operations  segment and  converts  such  amounts  into a
      performance  measure  referred to as funds from  operations  ffo  the
      operating  results for the individual  retail  shopping  centers have been
      aggregated  since all of the companys  shopping  centers  exhibit  highly
      similar economic  characteristics  as neighborhood  shopping centers  and
      offer similar degrees of risk and opportunities for growth ffo as defined
      by the national  association of real estate  investment trusts consists of
      net income  computed in accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting
      principles  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales
      of income producing  property held for investment  plus  depreciation and
      amortization  of  real  estate   and   adjustments   for   unconsolidated
      investments in real estate  partnerships  and joint ventures  the company
      further  adjusts  ffo by  distributions  made  to  holders  of  units  and
      preferred  stock  that  results  in a  diluted  ffo  amount  the  company
      considers  diluted  ffo to be the  industry  standard  for  reporting  the
      operations of real estate  investment  trusts  reits  adjustments for
      investments in real estate  partnerships are calculated to reflect diluted
      ffo on the same basis  while management  believes that diluted ffo is the
      most relevant and widely used measure of the companys  performance  such
      amount  does not  represent  cash  flow  from  operations  as  defined  by
      generally  accepted  accounting  principles  should not be  considered an
      alternative  to net  income as an  indicator  of the  companys  operating
      performance and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow
      needs additionally the companys calculation of diluted ffo as provided
      below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits

      the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in
      note 1 the revenues  diluted ffo and assets for each of the  reportable
      segments are  summarized as follows for the years ended december 31 2000
      1999 and 1998  assets not  attributable to a particular  segment consist
      primarily of cash and deferred costs

      of 143  million at december 31 2000  and the  companys  proportionate
      share of these loans was 59 million

      the fair value of the companys notes payable and line are estimated based
      on the  current  rates  available  to the  company  for  debt of the  same
      remaining  maturities  variable  rate notes  payable  and the line  are
      considered  to  be  at  fair  value  since  the  interest  rates  on  such
      instruments reprice based on current market conditions notes payable with
      fixed rates that have been assumed in connection with  acquisitions  are
      recorded in the  accompanying  financial  statements  at fair  value  the
      company considers the carrying value of all other fixed rate notes payable
      to be a reasonable  estimation  of their fair value based on the fact that
      the rates of such notes are similar to rates  available to the company for
      debt of the same terms

8    longterm stock incentive plans

      in 1993  the  company  adopted a  longterm  omnibus  plan  the  plan
      pursuant to which the board of directors may grant stock and stock options
      to officers  directors and other key employees the plan provides for the
      issuance of up to 12 of the companys  common shares  outstanding  not to
      exceed 85 million  shares  stock  options  are granted  with an exercise
      price equal to the stocks  fair  market  value at the date of grant  all
      stock options  granted have ten year terms  and contain  vesting terms of
      one to five years from the date of grant

      at december 31 2000 there were  approximately 2 million shares available
      for grant  under the plan  the per share  weightedaverage  fair value of
      stock options granted during 2000 and 1999 was 218 and 123 on the date
      of grant using the black scholes  optionpricing  model with the following
      weightedaverage   assumptions  2000    expected  dividend  yield  81
      riskfree interest rate of 67  expected volatility 20 and an expected
      life of 60 years 1999  expected dividend yield 92 riskfree interest
      rate of 57  expected volatility 21 and an expected life of 53 years
      the company  applies apb  opinion no 25 in  accounting  for its plan and
      accordingly  no  compensation  cost has  been  recognized  for its  stock
      options in the consolidated financial statements

      had the company  determined  compensation  cost based on the fair value at
      the grant date for its stock options under sfas no 123 the companys net
      income for common  stockholders  would have been  reduced to the pro forma
