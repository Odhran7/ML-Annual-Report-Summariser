risks related to our business 

our business and financial results have been adversely affected and could continue to be materially adversely affected by the covid19 crisis 

the covid19 crisis has caused disruptions in global economies financial and commodities markets and rapid shifts in governmental and public health policies in the countries where we operate or our customers are located or the industries in which we and our customers compete the covid19 crisis and the actions taken by governments businesses and individuals to curtail the spread of the disease have negatively impacted and are expected to continue to negatively impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition the extent of such impact will depend on future developments including the duration and spread of covid19 the speed at which the vaccine is distributed public acceptance of the vaccine along with the number of our employees receiving the vaccine in addition covid19 strain mutations may also hamper the vaccines effectiveness requirements related to covid19 safety precautions including vaccine mandates of varying scope and applicability may apply to our operations in the us or other jurisdictions failure to comply with the applicable requirements may result in governmental penalties and loss of business including our contracts or subcontracts with us federal state or local governments or international government entities which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations our implementation of various vaccination testing or other requirements related to covid19 may result in a reduction in productivity and employee morale or attrition which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

negative impacts that have occurred or may occur in the future include disruptions or restrictions on our employees’ ability to work effectively as well as temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers or our subcontractors or the requirements to deliver our services remotely in addition our employees continue to face challenges in their wellbeing given the additional financial family and health burdens that many employees have experienced and could continue to experience because of the covid19 crisis that may negatively impact our people’s mental and physical health engagement retention and performance continued public health threat and government responses could materially adversely affect our operations and the delivery of our services negative impacts from covid19 could potentially affect our ability to perform under our contracts with customers cost increases may not be recoverable from customers or covered by insurance which could impact our profitability if a business interruption occurs and we are unsuccessful in our continuing efforts to minimize the impact of these events our business results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

in addition the covid19 crisis has resulted in a widespread global health crisis that adversely affected the economies and financial markets of many countries any future economic downturn depending upon its severity and duration could also lead to a deterioration of worldwide credit and financial markets that could negatively affect the financial health of customers lower their demand for our services limit their ability or willingness to pay us in a timely manner and our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures result in losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties and result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults 

our financial results may also be materially and adversely impacted by a variety of factors related to covid19 that have not yet been determined including potential impairments of goodwill and other assets and changes to our contingent liabilities for which actual amounts may materially exceed management estimates and our calculation of global tax liabilities even after the covid19 crisis has subsided depending upon its duration and potential recurrence and the governmental policies in response thereto we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact including any recession that may occur or be continuing as a result 

we continue to evaluate the extent to which the covid19 crisis has impacted us and our employees customers and suppliers and the extent to which it and other emerging developments will impact us and our employees customers and suppliers in the future we caution investors that any of the factors mentioned above could have material and adverse impacts on our current and future business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

to the extent the covid19 crisis and the resulting economic disruption continue to adversely affect our business and financial results it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “risk factors” section such as those relating to our level of indebtedness our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness and to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness and our counterparty credit risk 

we may not succeed in our strategic objectives which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our transformation journey focuses on our customers optimizing costs and seizing the market our strategic priorities include an initiative to assist dxc customers across a broader range of their information technology needs which we refer to as “the enterprise technology stack” we may not be able to implement our strategic priorities and progress on our transformation journey in accordance with our expectations for a variety of reasons including failure to execute on our plans in a timely fashion lack of adequate skills ineffective management inadequate incentives customer resistance to new initiatives inability to control costs or maintain competitive offerings we also cannot be certain that executing on our strategy will generate the benefits we expect if we fail to execute successfully on our strategic priorities or if we pursue strategic priorities that prove to be unsuccessful our business financial position results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected 

we could be held liable for damages our reputation could suffer or we may experience service interruptions from security breaches cyberattacks other security incidents or disclosure of confidential information or personal data which could cause significant financial loss 

as a provider of it services to private and public sector customers operating in a number of industries and countries we store and process increasingly large amounts of data for our customers including sensitive and personally identifiable information we possess valuable proprietary information including copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and we collect and store certain personal and financial information from customers and employees we also manage it infrastructure and systems collectively “it systems” of our own and of customers and we rely on third parties who provide various critical hardware software and services to support our it systems and business operations 

security incidents can result from unintentional events or deliberate attacks by insiders such as employees contractors or service providers or third parties including criminals competitors nationstates and hacktivists these incidents can result in significant disruption to our business for example due to ransomware or denialofservice through an impact on our operations or those of our clients employees vendors or other partners loss of data including proprietary confidential or otherwise sensitive or valuable information belonging to us our clients employees vendors or partners reputational damage and injury to customer relationships we may also incur costs and liability whether contractual or otherwise such as monetary damages resulting from litigation remediation costs and regulatory actions fines or penalties any of the foregoing or a combination of the foregoing could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition in addition the regulatory environment related to information security and data privacy is evolving rapidly and the company will need to expend time and resources to ensure compliance with these evolving regulations and failure to understand and comply with these regulations can negatively impact the company its results of operations and financial condition 

we have experienced cyberattacks and security incidents in the past and we continue to see regular unauthorized efforts to access our it systems which we evaluate for severity and frequency while incidents experienced thus far have not resulted in significant disruption to our business it is possible that we could suffer a severe attack or incident with potentially material and adverse effects on our business reputation customer relations results of operations or financial condition the continued occurrence globally of highprofile data breaches and cyberattacks including by nationstate actors reflects an external environment that is increasingly hostile to information and corporate security like other companies we face an evolving array of information security and data security threats that pose risks to us and our customers 

threat actors are increasingly sophisticated and using tools and techniques designed to circumvent security controls to evade detection and to remove or obfuscate forensic evidence which may make it more difficult for us to detect identify investigate contain or recover from future cyberattacks and security incidents advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments may result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms that we use to protect our data and that of customers including sensitive customer transaction data computer programmers and hackers have deployed and may continue to develop and deploy ransomware malware and other malicious software programs through phishing and other methods that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of these products in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications produced or procured from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other vulnerabilities that could unexpectedly interfere with the security and operation of our systems or harm those of third parties with whom we may interact a party whether an insider or third party operating outside the company who is able to circumvent our security measures or those of our contractors partners or vendors could access our it systems or those of a critical third party and misappropriate proprietary information the confidential data of our customers employees or business partners or cause interruption in our or their operations the costs to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems including ransomware malware bugs malicious software programs and other security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers which may impede our sales distribution or other critical functions 

in the event of a cyberattack or security incident we could be exposed to regulatory actions customer attrition due to reputational concerns or otherwise containment and remediation expenses and claims brought by our customers or others for breaching contractual confidentiality and security provisions or data protection or privacy laws we must expend capital and other resources to protect against security incidents including attempted security breaches and cyberattacks and to alleviate problems caused by successful breaches or attacks the cost potential monetary damages and operational consequences of responding to security incidents and implementing remediation measures could be significant and may be in excess of insurance policy limits or be not covered by our insurance at all moreover failure to maintain effective internal accounting controls related to data security breaches and cybersecurity in general could impact our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny 

we expect increasing cybersecurity data privacy and information security obligations around the world to impose additional regulatory pressures on our customers’ businesses and indirectly on our operations or lead to inquiries investigations or enforcement actions in the united states we are seeing increasing obligations and expectations from government and nongovernment customers in response some of our customers have sought and may continue to seek to contractually impose certain strict data privacy and information security obligations on us some of our customer contracts may not limit our liability for the loss of confidential information or other business impact if we are unable to adequately address these concerns our business and results of operations could suffer 

compliance with new privacy and security laws requirements and regulations may result in cost increases due to expanded compliance obligations potential systems changes the development of additional administrative processes and increased enforcement actions litigation fines and penalties the regulatory landscape in these areas continues to evolve rapidly and there is a risk that the company could fail to address or comply with the fast changing regulatory environment which could lead to regulatory or other actions which result in material liability for the company for example in 2020 the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” came into force and provides new data privacy rights for california consumers and new operational requirements for covered companies the ccpa also includes a private right of action for certain data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation failure to comply with the ccpa could result in civil penalties of 2500 for each violation or 7500 for each intentional violation additionally a new privacy law the california privacy rights act “cpra” was approved by california voters in the november 3 2020 election the cpra which takes effect on january 1 2023 and significantly modifies the ccpa potentially results in further uncertainty and could require us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply some observers have noted the ccpa and cpra could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the united states which could also increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business for example the ccpa has encouraged “copycat” laws in other states across the country such as in virginia new hampshire illinois and nebraska this legislation may add additional complexity variation in requirements restrictions and potential legal risk require additional investment in compliance programs and could impact strategies and availability of previously useful data and could result in increased compliance costs andor changes in business practices and policies 

in addition the data protection landscape in the european union “eu” and further member states of the european economic area “eea”is continually evolving resulting in possible significant operational costs for internal compliance and risks to our business the eu adopted the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 and contains numerous requirements and changes from previously existing eu laws including more robust obligations on data processors and heavier documentation requirements for data protection compliance programs by companies 

among other requirements the gdpr regulates the transfer of personal data subject to the gdpr to third countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection to such personal data including the united states recent legal developments in europe have created complexity and uncertainty regarding such transfers for instance on july 16 2020 the court of justice of the european union the “cjeu” invalidated the euus privacy shield framework the “privacy shield” under which personal data could be transferred from the eea to us entities who had selfcertified under the privacy shield scheme while the cjeu upheld the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses a standard form of contract approved by the european commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism and potential alternative to the privacy shield it made clear that reliance on such clauses alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances use of the standard contractual clauses must now be assessed on a casebycase basis taking into account the legal regime applicable in the destination country including in particular applicable surveillance laws and rights of individuals and additional measures andor contractual provisions may need to be put in place however the nature of these additional measures is currently uncertain the cjeu went on to state that if a competent supervisory authority believes that the standard contractual clauses cannot be complied with in the destination country and that the required level of protection cannot be secured by other means such supervisory authority is under an obligation to suspend or prohibit that transfer 

failure to comply with the gdpr could result in penalties for noncompliance including possible fines of up to the greater of €20 million and 4 of our total annual revenue for the preceding financial year for the most serious violations as well as the right to compensation for financial or nonfinancial damages claimed by individuals under article 82 of the gdpr 

further in march 2017 the united kingdom “uk” formally notified the european council of its intention to leave the eu pursuant to article 50 of the treaty on european union “brexit” the uk ceased to be an eu member state on january 31 2020 but enacted a data protection act substantially implementing the gdpr the “uk gdpr” effective in may 2018 which was further amended to align more substantially with the gdpr following brexit it is unclear how uk data protection laws or regulations will develop in the medium to longer term since the beginning of 2021 we must comply with both the gdpr and the uk gdpr with each regime having the ability to fine up to the greater of €20 million in the case of the gdpr or £17 million in the case of the uk gdpr and 4 of total annual revenue for the preceding financial year 

while we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations as well as internal privacy policies any failure or perceived failure to comply or any misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information may result in proceedings or actions against us by government or other entities private lawsuits against us including class actions or the loss of customers which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations 

portions of our infrastructure and it systems also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and be expensive timeconsuming disruptive and resource intensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could reduce our revenues increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

our ability to continue to develop and expand our service offerings to address emerging business demands and technological trends including our ability to sell differentiated services up the enterprise technology stack may impact our future growth if we are not successful in meeting these business challenges our results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected 

our ability to implement solutions for our customers incorporating new developments and improvements in technology that translate into productivity improvements for our customers and our ability to develop digital and other new service offerings that meet current and prospective customers needs as well as evolving industry standards are critical to our success the markets we serve are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change which has resulted in deflationary pressure in the price of services which in turn can adversely impact our margins our competitors may develop solutions or services that make our offerings obsolete or may force us to decrease prices on our services which can result in lower margins our ability to develop and implement up to date solutions utilizing new technologies that meet evolving customer needs in digital cloud information technology outsourcing consulting industry software and solutions and application services markets and in areas such as artificial intelligence automation internet of things and asaservice solutions in a timely or costeffective manner will impact our ability to retain and attract customers and our future revenue growth and earnings if we are unable to continue to execute our strategy and build our business across the enterprise technology stack in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving environment or if we are unable to commercialize such services and solutions expand and scale them with sufficient speed and versatility our growth productivity objectives and profit margins could be negatively affected 

  

technological developments may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our customers some of these technologies have reduced and replaced some of our traditional services and solutions and may continue to do so in the future this has caused and may in the future cause customers to delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies such delays can negatively impact our results of operations if the pace and level of spending on new technologies by some of our customers is not sufficient to make up any shortfall by other customers our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas if we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry developments or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation our services and solutions our results of operations and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be negatively affected 

our ability to compete in certain markets we serve is dependent on our ability to continue to expand our capacity in certain offshore locations however as our presence in these locations increases we are exposed to risks inherent to these locations which may adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

a significant portion of our application outsourcing and software development activities has been shifted to india and we plan to continue to expand our presence there and in other lowercost locations as a result we are exposed to the risks inherent in operating in india or other locations including 1 public health crisis such as the covid19 pandemic and government responses 2 a highly competitive labor market for skilled workers which may result in significant increases in labor costs as well as shortages of qualified workers in the future and 3 the possibility that the us federal government or the european union may enact legislation that creates significant disincentives for customers to locate certain of their operations offshore which would reduce the demand for the services we provide in such locations and may adversely impact our cost structure and profitability in addition india has experienced and other countries may experience political instability civil unrest and hostilities with neighboring countries negative or uncertain political climates in countries or locations where we operate such as ukraine and russia including but not limited to military activities or civil hostilities criminal activities and other acts of violence infrastructure disruption natural disasters or other conditions could adversely affect our operations or cause us to exit certain markets 

on february 24 2022 russia invaded ukraine although the length impact and outcome of the ongoing military conflict in ukraine is highly unpredictable this conflict could lead to significant market and other disruptions including instability in financial markets supply chain interruptions political and social instability currency exchange limitations export controls changes in consumer or purchaser preferences as well as increase in cyberattacks and espionage as a result of this war some of our ukraine team members have been forced to relocate to other countries and within ukraine as of march 31 2022 we had more than 4000 employees in ukraine we are closely monitoring the developing situation are committed to caring for our colleagues in the region and are adapting to developments as they occur to protect the safety of our people and handle potential impacts to our delivery resources including relocating some of our employees and reallocating work to other geographies within our global footprint which may increase our costs the ongoing conflict could cause harm to our team members and otherwise impair their ability to work for extended periods of time as well as disrupt telecommunications systems banks and other critical infrastructure necessary to conduct business in ukraine in addition the united states created two new regional embargoes targeting the nonukrainian governmentcontrolled areas of the donetsk and luhansk oblasts of ukraine the socalled donetsk people’s republic and luhansk people’s republic regions of ukraine if large parts of ukraine become the target of further us or other applicable sanctions we may be legally unable to do business or otherwise continue to operate in ukraine if these contingencies come to pass our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 

in response to russian military actions in ukraine we have stopped pursuing business in russia and we are committed to exit the russian market as of march 31 2022 we had approximately 4000 employees in russia and sales into russia represented approximately 1 of our consolidated revenues for the year ended march 31 2022 we also have a back office and a delivery center in russia serving our international customers in connection with our exit of the russian market we also expect to experience increased costs as we shift our operations and resources to other geographies especially if we are not able to find alternate delivery resources to serve our international customers or achieve the same level of cost efficiencies we may also experience increased costs in relation to the replacement of employees severance payments and termination of our leases disruption to our services in the region may also arise from the knockon impact of the decisions of our customers or other companies that form part of our business ecosystem to withdraw or end their services in the region in addition sanctions and trade control measures implemented against russia or certain russian customers may have an impact on our ability to operate or to fulfill existing contracts as we wind down our business operations our ability to sell assets located in russia may also be impacted by sanctions affecting potential purchasers governmental authorities in the us the eu and the uk among others launched an expansion of coordinated sanctions and export control measures including among others blocking and other sanctions against some of the largest stateowned and private russian financial institutions and their subsequent removal from the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication “swift” payment system and certain russian businesses which may have a material impact on our ability to make and receive payments tofrom our russian business partners and customers any alleged or actual failure to comply with these measures as we extricate our business operations from russia may subject us to government scrutiny civil andor criminal proceedings sanctions and other liabilities which may have a material adverse effect on our international operations financial condition and results of operations actions taken by russia in response to such sanctions could also have a material adverse effect on our operations for example in response to increased sanctions russia or another government could attempt to take control of assets in russia or ukraine of western companies that are suspending or withdrawing their operations from russia such as dxc should our assets in the region be seized there is no guarantee that we would be able to recover those assets in the future our board has overall responsibility for oversight of risk at the company and has been engaged and provided oversight for the companys response to russias invasion of ukraine including the planned exit of russia our continuing compliance with sanctions the relocation and support of our people in the affected countries and the other risks described above 

we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended fcpa and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions we pursue opportunities in certain parts of the world that experience government corruption and in certain circumstances compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices our internal policies mandate compliance with all applicable antibribery laws we require our employees partners subcontractors agents and others to comply with the fcpa and other antibribery laws there is no assurance that our policies or procedures will protect us against liability under the fcpa or other laws for actions taken by our employees and intermediaries if we are found to be liable for fcpa violations either due to our own acts or our omissions or due to the acts or omissions of others we could suffer from severe criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations or cash flows in addition detecting investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of the fcpa or other antibribery violations is expensive and could consume significant time and attention of our senior management 

failure to maintain our credit rating and ability to manage working capital refinance and raise additional capital for future needs could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing cost and access to capital markets 

we currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with moodys investors service fitch rating services and standard  poors ratings services our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time rating agencies may review the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control including potential new standards requiring the agencies to reassess rating practices and methodologies ratings agencies may consider changes in credit ratings based on changes in expectations about future profitability and cash flows even if shortterm liquidity expectations are not negatively impacted if changes in our credit ratings were to occur it could result in higher interest costs under certain of our credit facilities it would also cause our future borrowing costs to increase and limit our access to capital markets for example we currently fund a portion of our working capital requirements in the us and european commercial paper markets any downgrade below our current rating would absent changes to current market liquidity substantially reduce or eliminate our ability to access that source of funding and could otherwise negatively impact the perception of our company by lenders and other third parties in addition certain of our major contracts provide customers with a right of termination in certain circumstances in the event of a rating downgrade below investment grade there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position and access to capital markets  

our liquidity is a function of our ability to successfully generate cash flows from a combination of efficient operations and continuing operating improvements access to capital markets and funding from third parties in addition like many multinational regulated enterprises our operations are subject to a variety of tax foreign exchange and regulatory capital requirements in different jurisdictions that have the effect of limiting delaying or increasing the cost of moving cash between jurisdictions or using our cash for certain purposes our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity going forward is subject to the general liquidity of and ongoing changes in the credit markets as well as general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other market factors that are beyond our control an increase in our borrowing costs limitations on our ability to access the global capital and credit markets or a reduction in our liquidity can adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

information regarding our credit ratings is included in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k under the caption liquidity and capital resources 

we have indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have indebtedness totaling approximately 50 billion as of march 31 2022 including capital lease obligations we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future for many reasons including to fund acquisitions our existing indebtedness together with the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the restrictive covenants contained in or expected to be contained in the documents evidencing such indebtedness could have significant consequences on our future operations including 

• events of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt instruments which could if material and not cured result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable or require us to negotiate an amendment to financial or other covenants that could cause us to incur additional fees and expenses 

• subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases in our outstanding variablerate 

indebtedness that could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

• increasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt which could increase future debt costs 

and limit the future availability for debt financing 

• debt service may reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors 

• increasing our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions and 

• causing us to reduce or eliminate our return of cash to our stockholders including via dividends and share repurchases 

in addition we could be unable to refinance our outstanding indebtedness on reasonable terms or at all 

our ability to meet our payment and other obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future this to some extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that current or future borrowings will be sufficient to meet our current debt obligations and to fund other liquidity needs 

in march 2021 the united kingdom financial conduct authority and the administrator of libor announced that us dollar libor settings will cease to be provided or cease to be representative after june 30 2023 the publication of all other libor settings ceased to be provided or ceased to be representative as of december 31 2021 in november 2020 us banking agencies issued guidance encouraging banks to stop entering new contracts that use us dollar libor as a reference rate as soon as practicable but no later than december 31 2021 as such we have amended the revolving credit agreement and certain of our other financing agreements to allow us to reference the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as the primary benchmark rate because sofr is fundamentally different from libor it is unknown whether sofr will attain market acceptance as a replacement for libor and there is no assurance as to how sofr may perform or that it is a comparable substitute for libor as a result we cannot reasonably predict the potential effect of the establishment of sofr or other alternative reference rates on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our primary markets are highly competitive if we are unable to compete in these highly competitive markets our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

our competitors include large technically competent and wellcapitalized companies some of which have emerged as a result of industry consolidation as well as “pureplay” companies that have a single product focus this competition may place downward pressure on operating margins in our industry particularly for technology outsourcing contract extensions or renewals as a result we may not be able to maintain our current operating margins or achieve favorable operating margins for technology outsourcing contracts extended or renewed in the future if we fail to effectively reduce our cost structure during periods with declining margins our results of operations may be adversely affected 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors our competitiveness is based on factors including technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation range of products and services account relationships customer training service and support and security if we are unable to compete based on such factors we could lose customers or we may experience reduced profitability from our customers and our results of operations and business prospects could be harmed we have a large portfolio of services and we need to allocate financial personnel and other resources across all services while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of our service lines as a result we may invest less in certain business areas than our competitors do and competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available to them compared to the resources allocated to our services industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate additionally competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with existing or potential customers or suppliers 

companies with whom we have alliances in certain areas may be or become competitors in other areas in addition companies with whom we have alliances also may acquire or form alliances with competitors which could reduce their business with us if we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with alliance partners our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we face aggressive price competition and may have to lower prices to stay competitive while simultaneously seeking to maintain or improve revenue and gross margin this price competition may continue to increase from emerging companies that sell products and services into the same markets in which we operate in addition competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lowercost markets in which we compete or who can obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer if we experience pressure from competitors to lower our prices we may have lower than expected profit margins and lost business opportunities if we are unable to match the price declines our cash flows results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressures 

if we are unable to accurately estimate the cost of services and the timeline for completion of contracts the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected 

our commercial contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis our bids are based upon among other items the expected cost to provide the services we generally provide services under time and materials contracts unit price contracts fixedprice contracts and multipleelement software sales we are dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects and the marketplace and to generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services required by the contract and to complete the contracts in a timely manner we face a number of risks when pricing our contracts as many of our projects entail the coordination of operations and workforces in multiple locations and utilizing workforces with different skill sets and competencies across geographically diverse service locations in addition revenues from some of our contracts are recognized using the percentageofcompletion method which requires estimates of total costs at completion fees earned on the contract or both this estimation process particularly due to the technical nature of the services being performed and the longterm nature of certain contracts is complex and involves significant judgment adjustments to original estimates are often required as work progresses experience is gained and additional information becomes known even though the scope of the work required under the contract may not change if we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected 

some ito services agreements contain pricing provisions that permit a customer to request a benchmark study by a mutually acceptable third party the benchmarking process typically compares the contractual price of services against the price of similar services offered by other specified providers in a peer comparison group subject to agreedupon adjustment and normalization factors generally if the benchmarking study shows that the pricing differs from the peer group outside a specified range and the difference is not due to the unique requirements of the customer then the parties will negotiate in good faith appropriate adjustments to the pricing this may result in the reduction of rates for the benchmarked services performed after the implementation of those pricing adjustments which could harm the financial performance of our services business 

some it service agreements require significant investment in the early stages that is expected to be recovered through billings over the life of the agreement these agreements often involve the construction of new it systems and communications networks and the development and deployment of new technologies substantial performance risk exists in each agreement with these characteristics and some or all elements of service delivery under these agreements are dependent upon successful completion of the development construction and deployment phases failure to perform satisfactorily under these agreements may expose us to legal liability result in the loss of customers or harm our reputation which could harm the financial performance of our it services business 

performance under contracts including those on which we have partnered with third parties may be adversely affected if we or the third parties fail to deliver on commitments or otherwise breach obligations to our customers 

our contracts are complex and in some instances may require that we partner with other parties including software and hardware vendors to provide the complex solutions required by our customers our ability to deliver the solutions and provide the services required by our customers is dependent on our and our partners ability to meet our customers delivery schedules which is affected by a multitude of factors including climate change if we or our partners fail to deliver services or products on time our ability to complete the contract may be adversely affected additionally our customers may perform audits or require us to perform audits and provide audit reports with respect to the controls and procedures that we use in the performance of services for such customers our ability to acquire new customers and retain existing customers may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed if we receive a qualified opinion or if we cannot obtain an unqualified opinion in a timely manner with respect to our controls and procedures in connection with any such audit we could also incur liability if our controls and procedures or the controls and procedures we manage for a customer were to result in an internal control failure or impair our customer’s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements if we or our partners fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise breach obligations to our customers we could be subject to legal liability which may have a material and adverse impact on our revenues and profitability 

natural disasters may affect our worldwide business operations and financial results 

climate change increases both the frequency and severity of natural disasters that may affect our worldwide business operations we have facilities around the world and our facilities our employees’ ability to work or our supply chain may be impacted by climate changerelated weather events or effects including natural disasters like hurricanes and storms as well as sea level rise drought flooding wildfires temperature changes and more intense weather events increasing temperatures resulting from global warming could lead to increasing energy costs and unfavorable operating cost impacts as well as extreme weather events that could cause loss of power to data centers and service disruptions resulting in contractual fines or loss of business additionally our customers’ facilities may be impacted by climate changerelated weather events or effects which may impact our ability to serve our customers any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to provide customers with competitive services is dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 

our ability to grow and provide our customers with competitive services is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly motivated people with the skills necessary to serve our customers the markets we serve are highly competitive and competition for skilled employees in the technology outsourcing consulting and systems integration and enterprise services markets is intense for both onshore and offshore locales immigration laws in the countries in which we operate are subject to legislative changes as well as to variations in the standards of application and enforcement due to political forces and economic conditions changes in immigration laws or varying applications of immigration laws to limit the availability of certain work visas in the us may impact our ability to hire talent that we need to enhance our products and services and for our operations it is also difficult to predict the political and economic events that could affect immigration laws or the restrictive impact they could have on obtaining or renewing work visas for our international personnel the loss of personnel could impair our ability to perform under certain contracts which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

additionally the inability to adequately develop and train personnel and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could have a material adverse effect on relationships with third parties our financial condition and results of operations and cash flows 

we also must manage leadership development and succession planning throughout our business any significant leadership change and accompanying senior management transition involves inherent risk and any failure to ensure a smooth transition could hinder our strategic planning execution and future performance while we strive to mitigate the negative impact associated with changes to our senior management team such changes may cause uncertainty among investors employees customers creditors and others concerning our future direction and performance if we fail to effectively manage our leadership changes including ongoing organizational and strategic changes our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and reputation as well as our ability to successfully attract motivate and retain key employees could be harmed 

in addition uncertainty around future employment opportunities facility locations organizational and reporting structures and other related concerns may impair our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel if employee attrition is high it may adversely impact our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our strategic priorities 

if we do not hire train motivate and effectively utilize employees with the right mix of skills and experience in the right geographic regions and for the right offerings to meet the needs of our customers our financial performance and cash flows could suffer for example if our employee utilization rate is too low our profitability and the level of engagement of our employees could decrease if that utilization rate is too high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition and the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects if we are unable to hire and retain enough employees with the skills or backgrounds needed to meet current demand we may need to redeploy existing personnel increase our reliance on subcontractors or increase employee compensation levels all of which could also negatively affect our profitability in addition if we have more employees than necessary with certain skill sets or in certain geographies we may incur increased costs as we work to rebalance our supply of skills and resources with customer demand in those geographies 

prolonged periods of inflation where we do not have adequate inflation protections in our customer contracts could increase costs have an adverse effect on general economic conditions and impact consumer budgeting which could impact our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we generally provide services under time and materials contracts unit price contracts fixedprice contracts and multipleelement software sales in many of our contracts we bear the risk of cost overruns completion delays resource requirements wage inflation and adverse movements in exchange rates in connection with these contracts certain but not all of these contracts provide for price adjustments for inflation or abnormal escalation however if one or more raw materials or components for our products eg semiconductors were to experience an isolated price increase without inflationary impacts on the broader economy we may not be entitled to inflation protection under those contracts 

additionally inflation has risen worldwide and the united states has recently experienced historically high levels of inflation if the inflation rate continues to increase it can also push up the costs of labor and our employee compensation expenses moreover the united states is experiencing a workforce shortage which in turn has created a hypercompetitive wage environment that may increase our operating costs there is no assurance that our revenues will increase at the same rate to maintain the same level of profitability 

inflation and government efforts to combat inflation such as raising benchmark interest rate could increase market volatility and have an adverse effect on the financial market and general economic conditions in a time of uncertainty our customers may have difficulty in budgeting for external it services delay procurement of products and services from us or delay their payment for products and services we have already provided all of which could adversely affect our profitability results of operations and cash flow 

our international operations are exposed to risks including fluctuations in exchange rates which may be beyond our control 

our exposure to currencies other than the us dollar may impact our results as they are expressed in us dollars currency variations also contribute to variations in sales of products and services in affected jurisdictions for example in the event that one or more european countries were to replace the euro with another currency sales in that country or in europe generally may be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established while historically we have partially mitigated currency risk including exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates by matching costs with revenues in a given currency our exposure to fluctuations in other currencies against the us dollar increases as revenue in currencies other than the us dollar increases and as more of the services we provide are shifted to lower cost regions of the world approximately 71 of revenues earned during fiscal 2022 were derived from sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and are expected to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues also we believe that our ability to match revenues and expenses in a given currency will decrease as more work is performed at offshore locations 

we may use forward and option contracts to protect against currency exchange rate risks the effectiveness of these hedges will depend on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which may be particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand and highly volatile exchange rates we may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and currency variations in addition certain or all of our hedging activities may be ineffective may expire and not be renewed or may not offset the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations losses associated with hedging activities may also impact our revenues and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial condition 

the uk withdrew from the european union on january 31 2020 “brexit” in connection with brexit the uk and the european union agreed on the trade and cooperation agreement “tca” that governs the future trading relationship between the uk and the european union in specified areas the tca took effect on january 1 2021 the uk is no longer in the european union customs union and is outside of the european union single market the tca addresses trade economic arrangements law enforcement judicial cooperation and a governance framework including procedures for dispute resolution among other things because the agreement merely sets forth a framework in many respects and will require complex additional bilateral negotiations between the uk and the european union as both parties continue to work on the rules for implementation significant political and economic uncertainty remains about whether the terms of the relationship will differ materially from the terms before withdrawal uncertainty surrounding the effect of brexit as well as any potential impact on tax laws and trade policy in the us and elsewhere may adversely impact our operations 

our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors including 

• ongoing instability or changes in a country’s or region’s economic or geopolitical and security conditions including inflation recession interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflict civil unrest crime political instability human rights concerns and terrorist activity 

• natural or manmade disasters industrial accidents public health issues cybersecurity incidents interruptions of service from utilities transportation or telecommunications providers or other catastrophic events 

• longer collection cycles and financial instability among customers 

• trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production pricing and marketing of products including policies adopted by countries that may champion or otherwise favor domestic companies and technologies over foreign competitors 

• local labor conditions and regulations 

• managing our geographically dispersed workforce 

• changes in the international national or local regulatory and legal environments 

• differing technology standards or customer requirements 

• difficulties associated with repatriating earnings generated or held abroad in a taxefficient manner and 

• changes in tax laws 

our business operations are subject to various and changing federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations social and environmental responsibility regulations policies and provisions as well as customer and investor demands may adversely affect our relationships with customers and investors 

we operate in approximately 70 countries in an increasingly complex regulatory environment among other things we provide complex industry specific insurance processing in the uk which is regulated by authorities in the uk and elsewhere such as the uk’s financial conduct authority and her majesty’s treasury and the us department of treasury which increases our exposure to compliance risk our retail investment account management business in germany is another example of a regulated business which must maintain a banking license is regulated by the german federal financial supervisory authority and the european central bank and must comply with german banking laws and regulations 

in addition businesses in the countries in which we operate are subject to local legal and political environments and regulations including with respect to employment tax statutory supervision and reporting and trade restriction along with industry regulations such as regulation by bank regulators in the us and europe these regulations and environments are also subject to change 

adjusting business operations to changing environments and regulations may be costly and could potentially render the particular business operations uneconomical which may adversely affect our profitability or lead to a change in the business operations notwithstanding our best efforts we may not be in compliance with all regulations in the countries in which we operate at all times and may be subject to sanctions penalties or fines as a result these sanctions penalties or fines may materially and adversely impact our profitability 

our operations are also subject to a broad array of domestic and international environmental health and safety laws and regulations including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites environmental costs and accruals are presently not material to our operations cash flows or financial position and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities however our failure to comply with these laws or regulations can result in civil criminal or regulatory penalties fines and legal liabilities suspension delay or alterations of our operations damage to our reputation and restrictions on our operations or sales our business could also be affected if new environmental legislation is passed which impacts our current operations and business for example if we are unable to comply with fastmoving regulatory requirements we could be disqualified from rfp processes leading to a loss of sales in addition as climate change laws regulations treaties and national and global initiatives are adopted and implemented regionally or throughout the world we may be required to comply or potentially face market access limitations fines or reputational injury such laws regulations treaties or initiatives in response to climate change including but not limited to the introduction of a carbon tax could result in increased operational costs associated with air pollution requirements and increased compliance and energy costs which could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our business operations moreover we may experience loss of market share if we are unable to provide competitive products and services that incorporate climatechange mitigations and if we are unable to achieve and sustain a carbonneutral business model in a meaningful time frame we could lose stockholder confidence resulting in loss of business and loss of access to the financial markets 

we are also subject to risks associated with environmental social and governance “esg” regulations governmental bodies investors clients and businesses are increasingly focused on prioritizing esg practices which has resulted in and may in the future continue to result in the adoption of new laws and regulations our inability to keep pace with any esg regulations trends and developments or failure to meet the expectations including but not limited to any expectations resulting from goals we have established or interests of our clients and investors could adversely affect our business and reputation and could result in undesirable investor actions or customer or talent retention and attraction issues 

we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plans and our restructuring may adversely affect our business 

we have implemented several restructuring plans to realign our cost structure due to the changing nature of our business and to achieve operating efficiencies to reduce our costs we may not be able to obtain the costs savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring plans additionally as a result of our restructuring we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge andor inefficiency during transitional periods reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees time and focus which may divert attention from operating and growing our business there are also significant costs associated with restructuring which can have a significant impact on our earnings and cash flow if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for more information about our restructuring plans see note 22  restructuring costs 

in the course of providing services to customers we may inadvertently infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and be exposed to claims for damages 

the solutions we provide to our customers may inadvertently infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties resulting in claims for damages against us or our customers our contracts generally indemnify our customers from claims for intellectual property infringement for the services and equipment we provide under the applicable contracts we also indemnify certain vendors and customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use by such vendors and customers of software products and services and certain other matters some of the applicable indemnification arrangements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses the expense and time of defending against these claims may have a material and adverse impact on our profitability if we lose our ability to continue using any such services and solutions because they are found to infringe the rights of others we will need to obtain substitute solutions or seek alternative means of obtaining the technology necessary to continue to provide such services and solutions our inability to replace such solutions or to replace such solutions in a timely or costeffective manner could materially adversely affect our results of operations additionally the publicity resulting from infringing intellectual property rights may damage our reputation and adversely impact our ability to develop new business 

our inability to procure thirdparty licenses required for the operation of our products and service offerings may result in decreased revenue or increased costs 

many of our products and service offerings depends on the continued performance and availability of software licensed from thirdparty vendors under our contractual arrangements because of the nature of these licenses and arrangements there can be no assurance that we would be able to retain all of these intellectual property rights upon renewal expiration or termination of such licenses or that we will be able to procure renew or extend such licenses on commercially reasonable terms which may result in increased costs certain of our licenses are concentrated in one or more thirdparty licensors where multiple licenses are up for renewal at the same time which could decrease our ability to negotiate reasonable license fees and could result in our loss of rights under such licenses 

disruption of our supply chain could adversely impact our business 

we are experiencing and may continue to experience delays and shortages of certain necessary components to the services and solutions we offer our clients resulting from issues with the global supply chain the covid19 pandemic the conflict between russia and ukraine and any disruptions at our suppliers this shortage may increase component delivery lead times and costs to source available components and delay the delivery of our hardware products and services which may adversely affect our ability to comply with our contracts and our ability to support our existing customers and our growth through sales to new customers in the event of a component shortage or interruptions at a supplier we may not be able to develop alternate sources quickly cost effectively or at all supply chain interruptions could harm our relationships with our customers prevent us from acquiring new customers and materially and adversely affect our business 

we may be exposed to negative publicity and other potential risks if we are unable to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the related regulations require our management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud however a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met there can be no assurance that all control issues or fraud will be detected 

any failure to maintain effective controls could prevent us from timely and reliably reporting financial results and may harm our operating results in addition if we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of each fiscal year end we may be exposed to negative publicity which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information any failure to maintain effective internal controls and any such resulting negative publicity may negatively affect our business and stock price 

additionally the existence of any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies would require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a timely manner the existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations subject us to litigation or regulatory scrutiny and cause stockholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information all of which could materially and adversely affect us and the market price of our common stock during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 our management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2019 related to reassessing policies and procedures to determine their continued relevance as impacted by complex transactions and processes although this material weakness was remediated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 we cannot assure you that we will not identify another material weakness in the future 

we could suffer additional losses due to asset impairment charges 

we acquired substantial goodwill and other intangibles as a result of the hpes merger and the luxoft acquisition increasing our exposure to this risk we test our goodwill for impairment during the second quarter of every year and on an interim date should events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount if the fair value of a reporting unit is revised downward due to declines in business performance or other factors or if the company suffers further declines in share price an impairment could result and a noncash charge could be required we test intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable this assessment of the recoverability of finitelived intangible assets could result in an impairment and a noncash charge could be required we also test certain equipment and deferred cost balances associated with contracts when the contract is materially underperforming or is expected to materially underperform in the future as compared to the original bid model or budget if the projected cash flows of a particular contract are not adequate to recover the unamortized cost balance of the asset group the balance is adjusted in the tested period based on the contracts fair value either of these impairments could materially affect our reported net earnings 

we may not be able to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock in accordance with our announced intent or at all 

on april 3 2017 we announced the establishment of a share repurchase plan approved by the board of directors with an initial authorization of up to 20 billion for future repurchases of outstanding shares of our common stock on november 8 2018 dxc announced that its board of directors approved an incremental 20 billion share repurchase authorization on february 2 2022 we announced our intention to repurchase incrementally up to 10 billion of our outstanding shares of common stock in the open market in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations including rule 10b18 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended however we are not obligated to make any purchases of our shares and our decision to repurchase our shares as well as the timing of such repurchases will depend on a variety of factors as determined by our management and board of directors 

in addition while we paid quarterly cash dividends to our stockholders starting fiscal 2018 in accordance with our announced dividend policy we suspended the payment of quarterly dividends starting in fiscal 2021 to enhance our financial flexibility at this time we do not intend to reinstate our quarterly cash dividends the declaration and payment of future dividends the amount of any such dividends and the establishment of record and payment dates for dividends if any are subject to final determination by our board of directors after review of our current strategy and financial performance and position among other things 

the board of directors’ determinations regarding dividends and share repurchases will depend on a variety of factors including net income cash flow generated from operations amount and location of our cash and investment balances overall liquidity position and potential alternative uses of cash such as acquisitions as well as economic conditions and expected future financial results there can be no guarantee that we will achieve our financial goals in the amounts or within the expected time frame or at all our ability to declare future dividends or repurchase shares will depend on our future financial performance which in turn depends on the successful implementation of our strategy and on financial competitive regulatory and other factors general economic conditions demand and prices for our services and other factors specific to our industry or specific projects many of which are beyond our control therefore our ability to generate cash flow depends on the performance of our operations and could be limited by decreases in our profitability or increases in costs regulatory changes capital expenditures or debt servicing requirements 

any failure to achieve our financial goals could negatively impact our reputation harm investor confidence in us and cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

we are defendants in pending litigation that may have a material and adverse impact on our profitability and liquidity 

as noted in note 23  commitments and contingencies we are currently party to a number of disputes that involve or may involve litigation or arbitration including securities litigation in which we and certain of our current or former officers and directors have been named as defendants the result of these and any other future legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of their subject matter or merits such legal proceedings may result in significant cost to us including in the form of legal fees andor damages which may not be covered by insurance may divert the attention of management or may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations negative publicity from litigation whether or not resulting in a substantial cost could materially damage our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and the price of our common stock in addition such legal proceedings may make it more difficult to finance our operations 

we are also subject to continuous examinations of our income tax returns by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final results of any tax examination or related litigation could be materially different from our related historical income tax provisions and accruals adverse developments in an audit examination or litigation related to previously filed tax returns or in the relevant jurisdiction’s tax laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations could have a material effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods for more details including on current tax examinations of our income tax returns by tax authorities see note 13 – “income taxes” 

we may be adversely affected by disruptions in the credit markets including disruptions that reduce our customers access to credit and increase the costs to our customers of obtaining credit 

the credit markets have historically been volatile and therefore it is not possible to predict the ability of our customers to access shortterm financing and other forms of capital if a disruption in the credit markets were to occur it could pose a risk to our business if customers or suppliers are unable to obtain financing to meet payment or delivery obligations to us in the event that one or more customers or suppliers defaults on its payment or delivery obligations we could incur significant losses which may harm our business reputation results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition customers may decide to downsize defer or cancel contracts which could negatively affect our revenues 

further as of march 31 2022 we have 04 billion of floating interest rate debt accordingly a spike in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

our hedging program is subject to counterparty default risk 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps with a number of counterparties as a result we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these contracts defaults on its performance under the contract during an economic downturn the counterpartys financial condition may deteriorate rapidly and with little notice and we may be unable to take action to protect our exposure in the event of a counterparty default we could incur significant losses which may harm our business and financial condition in the event that one or more of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy our ability to eventually recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterpartys default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty 

we derive significant revenues and profit from contracts awarded through competitive bidding processes which can impose substantial costs on us and we may not achieve revenue and profit objectives if we fail to bid on these projects effectively 

we derive significant revenues and profit from government contracts that are awarded through competitive bidding processes we expect that most of the nonus government business we seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through competitive bidding competitive bidding is expensive and presents a number of risks including 

• the substantial cost and managerial time and effort that we spend to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may or may not be awarded to us 

• the need to estimate accurately the resources and costs that will be required to service any contracts we are awarded sometimes in advance of the final determination of their full scope and design 

• the expense and delay that may arise if our competitors protest or challenge awards made to us pursuant to competitive bidding 

• the requirement to resubmit bids protested by our competitors and in the termination reduction or modification of the awarded contracts and 

• the opportunity cost of not bidding on and winning other contracts we might otherwise pursue 

if our customers experience financial difficulties we may not be able to collect our receivables which would materially and adversely affect our profitability and cash flows from operations 

over the course of a contract term a customers financial condition may decline and limit its ability to pay its obligations this could cause our cash collections to decrease and bad debt expense to increase while we may resort to alternative methods to pursue claims or collect receivables these methods are expensive and time consuming and successful collection is not guaranteed failure to collect our receivables or prevail on claims would have an adverse effect on our profitability and cash flows 

if we are unable to maintain and grow our customer relationships over time our operating results and cash flows will suffer failure to comply with customer contracts or government contracting regulations or requirements could adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows 

we devote significant resources to establish relationships with our customers and implement our offerings and related services particularly in the case of large enterprises that often request or require specific features or functions specific to their particular business profile accordingly our results of operations depend in substantial part on our ability to deliver a successful customer experience and persuade customers to maintain and grow their relationship with us over time if we are not successful in implementing an offering or delivering a successful customer experience including achieving cost and staffing levels that meet our customers’ expectations customers could terminate or elect not to renew their agreements with us and our operating results may suffer 

contracts with customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements in particular our contracts with federal state provincial and local governmental customers are generally subject to various procurement regulations contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance including the maintenance of necessary security clearances contracts with us government agencies are also subject to audits and investigations which may include a review of performance on contracts pricing practices cost structure and compliance with applicable laws and regulations 

any failure on our part to comply with the specific provisions in customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations or other requirements could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments and in the case of government contracts fines and suspension from future government contracting such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business in addition we may be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to government contracts which could include claims for treble damages further any negative publicity with respect to customer contracts or any related proceedings regardless of accuracy may damage our business by harming our ability to compete for new contracts 

contracts with the us federal government and related agencies are also subject to issues with respect to federal budgetary and spending limits or matters any changes to the fiscal policies of the us federal government may decrease overall government funding result in delays in the procurement of products and services due to lack of funding cause the us federal government and government agencies to reduce their purchases under existing contracts or cause them to exercise their rights to terminate contracts atwill or to abstain from exercising options to renew contracts any of which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows 

if our customer contracts are terminated if we are suspended or disbarred from government work or our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our financial performance could suffer 

our strategic transactions may prove unsuccessful and our profitability may be materially and adversely affected 

at any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more transactions including acquisitions divestitures or spinoffs strategic partnerships or other transaction involving one or more of our businesses any of these transactions could be material to our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we may ultimately determine not to proceed with any transaction for commercial financial strategic or other reasons as a result we may not realize benefits expected from exploring one or more strategic transactions may realize benefits further in the future or those benefits may ultimately be significantly smaller than anticipated which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition we may fail to complete transactions closing transactions is subject to uncertainties and risks including the risk that we may be unable to satisfy conditions to closing such as regulatory and financing conditions and the absence of material adverse changes to our business 

for acquisitions our inability to successfully integrate the operations we acquire and leverage these operations to generate substantial cost savings as well as our inability to avoid revenue erosion and earnings decline could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial position in order to achieve successful acquisitions we will need to 

• integrate the operations and business cultures as well as the accounting financial controls management information technology human resources and other administrative systems of acquired businesses with existing operations and systems 

• maintain thirdparty relationships previously established by acquired companies 

• attract and retain senior management and key personnel at acquired businesses and 

• manage new business lines as well as acquisitionrelated workload 

existing contractual restrictions may limit our ability to engage in certain integration activities for varying periods we may not be successful in meeting these or any other challenges encountered in connection with historical and future acquisitions even if we successfully integrate we cannot predict with certainty if or when these cost and revenue synergies growth opportunities and benefits will occur or the extent to which they actually will be achieved in addition the quantification of previously announced synergies expected to result from an acquisition is based on significant estimates and assumptions that are subjective in nature and inherently uncertain realization of any benefits and synergies could be affected by a number of factors beyond our control including without limitation general economic conditions increased operating costs regulatory developments and other risks in addition future acquisitions could require dilutive issuances of equity securities andor the assumption of contingent liabilities the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

divestiture transactions also involve significant challenges and risks including 

• the potential loss of key customers suppliers vendors and other key business partners 

• declining employee morale and retention issues affecting employees which may result from changes in compensation or changes in management reporting relationships future prospects or perceived expectations 

• difficulty making new and strategic hires of new employees 

• diversion of management time and a shift of focus from operating the businesses to transaction execution considerations 

• customers delaying or deferring decisions or ending their relationships 

• the need to provide transition services which may result in stranded costs and the diversion of resources and focus 

• the need to separate operations systems including accounting management information human resource and other administrative systems technologies products and personnel which is an inherently risky and potentially lengthy and costly process 

• the inefficiencies and lack of control that may result if such separation is delayed or not implemented effectively and unforeseen difficulties and expenditures that may arise as a result including potentially significant stranded costs 

• our desire to maintain an investment grade credit rating may cause us to use cash proceeds if any from any divestitures or other strategic transactions that we might otherwise have used for other purposes in order to reduce our financial leverage 

• the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or otherwise satisfy conditions required in order consummate any such transactions 

• our dependence on accounting financial reporting operating metrics and similar systems controls and processes of divested businesses could lead to challenges in preparing our consolidated financial statements or maintaining effective financial control over financial reporting and 

• contractual terms limiting our ability to compete for or perform certain contracts or services 

we have also entered into and intend to identify and enter into additional strategic partnerships with other industry participants that will allow us to expand our business however we may be unable to identify attractive strategic partnership candidates or complete these partnerships on terms favorable to us in addition if we are unable to successfully implement our partnership strategies or our strategic partners do not fulfill their obligations or otherwise prove disadvantageous to our business our investments in these partnerships and our anticipated business expansion could be adversely affected 

changes in us tax legislation may materially affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

recently enacted us tax legislation has significantly changed the us federal income taxation of us corporations including by reducing the us corporate income tax rate limiting interest deductions permitting immediate expensing of certain capital expenditures adopting elements of a territorial tax system imposing a onetime transition tax or “repatriation tax” on all undistributed earnings and profits of certain usowned foreign corporations revising the rules governing net operating losses and the rules governing foreign tax credits introducing new antibase erosion provisions and the ability to expense research and experimentation costs many of these changes were effective immediately without any transition periods or grandfathering for existing transactions the legislation is unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the us department of the treasury and internal revenue service irs any of which could lessen or increase certain impacts of the legislation in addition state and local jurisdictions continue to issue guidance on how these us federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities 

the repatriation tax resulted in a material amount of additional us tax liability the majority of which was reflected as an income tax expense in fiscal 2018 when the tax legislation was enacted despite the fact that the resulting tax may be paid over eight years 

in january 2022 the us treasury published final foreign tax credit regulations which included provisions that are applicable to fiscal 2022 prior and future years the final regulations among other things provide guidance regarding whether certain foreign taxes qualify for us foreign tax credit purposes and how foreign taxes are apportioned for purposes of computing the us foreign tax credit we have considered the impact of the new regulations in our fiscal 2022 income tax provision and evaluated the impact on prior years noting no significant impact to prior years income tax provisions in addition the 2017 tax cuts  jobs act tcja contained a provision that requires taxpayers to capitalize research and development costs effective for tax years beginning after december 31 2021 which will be applicable the company for fy23 and subsequent years 

while some of the changes made by recent tax legislation may be beneficial to the company in one or more reporting periods and prospectively other changes may be adverse on a going forward basis we continue to work with our tax advisors to determine the full impact that recent tax legislation as a whole will have on us further there may be other material adverse effects resulting from future guidance including technical corrections 

changes in tax rates tax laws and the outcome of tax examinations could affect our future results 

our future effective tax rates which are largely driven by the mix of our global earnings and the differing statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions where we operate are subject to change as a result of changes in statutory tax rates enacted in those jurisdictions or by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

risks related to our completed strategic transactions 

we could have an indemnification obligation to hpe if the stock distribution in connection with the hpes business separation the distribution were determined not to qualify for taxfree treatment which could materially adversely affect our financial condition 

if due to any of our representations being untrue or our covenants being breached the distribution was determined not to qualify for taxfree treatment under section 355 of the internal revenue code the code hpe would generally be subject to tax as if it sold the dxc common stock in a taxable transaction which could result in a material tax liability in addition each hpe stockholder who received dxc common stock in the distribution would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the dxc common stock received by the stockholder in the distribution 

under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with hpe in connection with the hpes merger we were required to indemnify hpe against taxes resulting from the distribution or certain aspects of the hpes merger arising as a result of an everett tainting act as defined in the tax matters agreement if we were required to indemnify hpe for taxes resulting from an everett tainting act that indemnification obligation would likely be substantial and could materially adversely affect our financial condition 

if the hpes merger does not qualify as a reorganization under section 368a of the code cscs former stockholders may incur significant tax liabilities 

the completion of the hpes merger was conditioned upon the receipt by hpe and csc of opinions of counsel to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the hpes merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368a of the code the hpes merger tax opinions the parties did not seek a ruling from the irs regarding such qualification the hpes merger tax opinions were based on current law and relied upon various factual representations and assumptions as well as certain undertakings made by hpe hpes and csc if any of those representations or assumptions is untrue or incomplete in any material respect or any of those undertakings is not complied with or if the facts upon which the hpes merger tax opinions are based are materially different from the actual facts that existed at the time of the hpes merger the conclusions reached in the hpes merger tax opinions could be adversely affected and the hpes merger may not qualify for taxfree treatment opinions of counsel are not binding on the irs or the courts no assurance can be given that the irs will not challenge the conclusions set forth in the hpes merger tax opinions or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the hpes merger were determined to be taxable previous holders of csc common stock would be considered to have made a taxable disposition of their shares to hpes and such stockholders would generally recognize taxable gain or loss on their receipt of hpes common stock in the hpes merger 

we assumed certain material pension benefit obligations in connection with the hpes merger these liabilities and the related future funding obligations could restrict our cash available for operations capital expenditures and other requirements and may materially adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity 

pursuant to the employee matters agreement entered into in connection with the hpes merger while hpe retained all us defined benefit pension plan liabilities dxc retained all liabilities relating to the international retirement guarantee “irg” programs for all hpes employees the irg is a nonqualified retirement plan for employees who transfer internationally at the request of the hpe group the irg determines the country of guarantee which is generally the country in which an employee has spent the longest portion of his or her career with the hpe group and the present value of a full career benefit for the employee under the hpe defined benefit pension plan and social security or social insurance system in the country of guarantee the irg then offsets the present value of the retirement benefits from plans and social insurance systems in the countries in which the employee earned retirement benefits for his or her total period of hpe group employment the net benefit value is payable as a single sum as soon as practicable after termination or retirement this liability could restrict cash available for our operations capital expenditures and other requirements and may materially affect our financial condition and liquidity 

in addition pursuant to the employee matters agreement dxc assumed certain other defined benefit pension liabilities in a number of nonus countries including the uk germany and switzerland unless otherwise agreed or required by local law where a defined benefit pension plan was maintained solely by a member of the hpes business dxc assumed all assets and liabilities arising out of those nonus defined benefit pension plans and where a defined benefit pension plan was not maintained solely by a member of the hpes business dxc assumed all assets and liabilities for those eligible hpes employees in connection with the hpes merger these liabilities and the related future payment obligations could restrict cash available for our operations capital expenditures and other requirements and may materially affect our financial condition and liquidity 

the usps separation and mergers and nps separation could result in substantial tax liability to dxc and our stockholders 

among the closing conditions to completing the usps separation and mergers we received a legal opinion of tax counsel substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes i the usps separation qualifies as a “reorganization” within the meaning of section 368a1d of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” ii each of dxc and perspecta is a “party to a reorganization” within the meaning of section 368b of the code with respect to the usps separation iii the usps distribution qualifies as 1 a taxfree spinoff resulting in nonrecognition under sections 355a 361 and 368a of the code and 2 a transaction in which the stock distributed thereby should constitute “qualified property” for purposes of sections 355d 355e and 361c of the code and iv none of the related mergers causes section 355e of the code to apply to the usps distribution if notwithstanding the conclusions expressed in these opinions the usps separation and mergers were determined to be taxable dxc and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities 

in addition prior to the hpes merger csc spun off its north american public sector business nps on november 27 2015 the nps separation in connection with the nps separation csc received an opinion of counsel substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the nps separation qualified as a taxfree transaction to csc and holders of csc common stock under section 355 and related provisions of the code the completion of the hpes merger was conditioned upon the receipt of csc of an opinion of counsel to the effect that the hpes merger should not cause section 355e of the code to apply to the nps separation or otherwise affect the qualification of the nps separation as a taxfree distribution under section 355 of the code  if notwithstanding the conclusions expressed in these opinions the nps separation were determined to be taxable csc and csc stockholders that received csra inc csra stock in the nps separation could incur significant tax liabilities 

the opinions of counsel we received were based on among other things various factual representations and assumptions as well as certain undertakings made by dxc perspecta and csra if any of those representations or assumptions is untrue or incomplete in any material respect or any of those undertakings is not complied with the conclusions reached in the opinion could be adversely affected and the usps separation or the nps separation may not qualify for taxfree treatment furthermore an opinion of counsel is not binding on the irs or the courts accordingly no assurance can be given that the irs will not challenge the conclusions set forth in the opinions or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if notwithstanding our receipt of the opinions the usps separation or nps separation is determined to be taxable we would recognize taxable gain as if we had sold the shares of perspecta or csra in a taxable sale for its fair market value which could result in a substantial tax liability in addition if the usps separation or nps separation is determined to be taxable each holder of our common stock who received shares of perspecta or csra would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received which could materially increase such holder’s tax liability 

additionally even if the usps separation otherwise qualifies as a taxfree transaction the usps distribution could be taxable to us but not to our shareholders in certain circumstances if future significant acquisitions of our stock or the stock of perspecta are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the usps distribution in this event the resulting tax liability could be substantial in connection with the usps separation we entered into a tax matters agreement with perspecta under which it agreed not to undertake any transaction without our consent that could reasonably be expected to cause the usps separation to be taxable to us and to indemnify us for any tax liabilities resulting from such transactions these obligations and potential tax liabilities could be substantial

• fiscal 2022 income tax expense decreased significantly compared to fiscal 2021 as a result of the gain on disposition of the hhs business which included the impact of nontax deductible goodwill in fiscal 2021 

• our cash and cash equivalents were 2672 million at march 31 2022 

• we generated 1501 million of cash from operations during fiscal 2022 as compared to 124 million during fiscal 2021 

revenues 

during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 the distribution of our revenues across operating segments and geographies were as follows 



  

1 constant currency revenues are a nongaap measure calculated by translating current period activity into us dollars using the comparable prior period’s currency conversion rates this information is consistent with how management views our revenues and evaluates our operating performance and trends for more information see nongaap financial measures 

the decrease in revenues for fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021 reflects the disposition of the hps business during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 in addition to disposition of the hhs business during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 project completions project terminations and contractual price adjustments also contributed to the decrease in revenues the decrease in revenues was partially offset by additional services provided to new and existing customers increased passthrough revenue associated with the resale of hardware and software and increased runrate project volumes fiscal 2022 revenues included a favorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 08 primarily driven by the weakening of the us dollar against the british pound canadian dollar and australian dollar 

for a discussion of risks associated with our foreign operations see part i item 1a  risk factors subsections titled our ability to compete in certain markets we serve is dependent on our ability to continue to expand our capacity in certain offshore locations however as our presence in these locations increases we are exposed to risks inherent to these locations which may adversely affect our revenue and profitability and “our international operations are exposed to risks including fluctuations in exchange rates which may be beyond our control 

global business services 

our gbs revenues were 76 billion for fiscal 2022 a decrease of 89 compared to fiscal 2021 gbs revenue in constant currency decreased 93 compared to fiscal 2021 the decrease in gbs revenues was primarily due to the disposition of the hps business at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2022 the disposition of the hhs business during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and project completions the decrease in gbs revenues was partially offset by an increase in runrate project volumes and additional services provided to new and existing customers 

global infrastructure services 

our gis revenues were 87 billion for fiscal 2022 a decrease of 77 compared to fiscal 2021 gis revenue in constant currency decreased 89 compared to fiscal 2021 the decrease in gis revenues reflects project completions project terminations a decrease in runrate project volumes and contractual price adjustments the decrease in gis revenues was partially offset by additional services provided to new and existing customers and increased passthrough revenue associated with the resale of hardware and software 

during fiscal 2022 gbs and gis had contract awards of 94 billion and 87 billion respectively compared with 110 billion and 88 billion respectively during fiscal 2021 

costs and expenses 

our total costs and expenses were as follows 



the 330 basis point decrease in total costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2022 primarily reflects cost optimization realized in the current period lower costs after the dispositions of the hps and hhs businesses lower transaction separation and integrationrelated costs a reduction in restructuring activities decreases in depreciation and amortization and an increase in other income expense attributed to income from nonservice components of net periodic pension income expense partially offset by a decrease in gain on disposition of businesses and an increase in debt extinguishment costs 

costs of services 

cost of services excluding depreciation and amortization and restructuring costs cos was 127 billion for fiscal 2022 as compared to 141 billion in fiscal 2021 cos decreased 14 billion compared to the prior fiscal year the decrease in cos was primarily due to cost optimization savings realized during fiscal 2022 and reduced costs resulting from the dispositions of the hps business during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and the hhs business during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 cos as a percentage of revenue decreased 17 as compared to the prior fiscal year the decrease was primarily driven by cost reductions exceeding the associated decline in revenue compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expense excluding depreciation and amortization and restructuring costs sga was 14 billion for fiscal 2022 as compared to 21 billion in fiscal 2021 sga decreased 07 billion compared to the prior fiscal year the decrease in sga was primarily driven by lower transaction separation and integrationrelated costs cost optimization savings realized during fiscal 2022 and reduced costs resulting from the dispositions of the hps business during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and the hhs business during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 

transaction separation and integrationrelated costs included in sga were 26 million during fiscal 2022 as compared to 358 million during fiscal 2021 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation expense was 625 million for fiscal 2022 as compared to 754 million in fiscal 2021 depreciation expense decreased 129 million primarily due to a reduction in assets due to impairment of undeployed assets in the prior year and asset retirements 

amortization expense was 1092 million for fiscal 2022 as compared to 1216 million in fiscal 2021 amortization expense decreased 124 million primarily due to a decrease in customer related intangibles related to the disposition of the hhs business during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and a reduction in transition and transformation contract cost amortization due to contract completions 

restructuring costs 

restructuring costs represent severance related to workforce optimization programs and expense associated with facilities and data center rationalization 

during fiscal 2022 management approved global cost savings initiatives designed to better align our workforce and facility structures total restructuring costs recorded net of reversals during fiscal 2022 and 2021 were 318 million and 551 million respectively 

see note 22  restructuring costs for additional information about our restructuring actions 

interest expense and interest income 

interest expense for fiscal 2022 was 204 million as compared to 361 million in fiscal 2021 a decrease of 43 the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a reduction in bonds and term loans and the companys refinancing of its high coupon debt during fiscal 2022 decreased amounts drawn on our revolving credit facility and decreases to finance leases and asset financing 

interest income for fiscal 2022 was 65 million as compared to 98 million in fiscal 2021 the decrease in interest income was primarily driven by lower income from our multicurrency cash pools and money market accounts as well as decreases in lease interest income 

debt extinguishment costs 

debt extinguishment costs for fiscal 2022 were 311 million as compared to 41 million in fiscal 2021 debt extinguishment costs for fiscal 2022 include costs related to the full redemption of our eurodenominated term loan facility two series of 445 senior notes due fiscal 2023 425 senior notes due fiscal 2025 275 senior notes due fiscal 2025 4125 senior notes due fiscal 2026 475 senior notes due fiscal 2028 745 senior notes due fiscal 2030 extinguishment of debt associated with asset financing and costs related to the decrease in our revolving credit facility limit from 4 billion to 3 billion 

debt extinguishment costs for fiscal 2021 consisted primarily of costs related to the redemption of 400 senior notes due fiscal 2024 

gain on dispositions 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 dxc sold its hps business for 551 million which resulted in an estimated pretax gain on sale of 331 million net of closing costs insignificant businesses were also sold during fiscal 2022 that resulted in a gain of 53 million this was partially offset by 13 million in sales price adjustments related to prior year dispositions which resulted from changes in projected closing net working capital 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 dxc sold its hhs business for 50 billion which resulted in an estimated pretax gain on sale of 2014 million net of closing costs insignificant businesses were also sold during fiscal 2021 that resulted in a loss of 10 million 

other income expense net 

other income expense net comprises nonservice cost components of net periodic pension income expense movement in foreign currency exchange rates on our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and the related economic hedges equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and other miscellaneous gains and losses 

the components of other income expense net for fiscal 2022 and 2021 are as follows 



the 1183 million increase in other income net for fiscal 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year was due to a yearoveryear increase of 1176 million in nonservice components of net periodic pension income attributable to changes in marktomarket actuarial assumptions and asset valuations a 6 million increase in other gains from sales of nonoperating assets and a yearoveryear favorable foreign currency impact of 1 million 

taxes 

our effective tax rate etr on income loss from continuing operations before taxes for fiscal 2022 and 2021 was 355 and 1223 respectively a reconciliation of the differences between the us federal statutory rate and the etr as well as other information about our income tax provision is provided in note 13  income taxes 

in fiscal 2022 the etr was primarily impacted by 

• income tax and foreign tax credits which decreased income tax expense and decreased the etr by 174 million and 152 respectively 

• changes in luxembourg losses that increased the etr by 1609 million and 1410 respectively with an offsetting decrease in the etr due to a decrease in the valuation allowance of the same amount 

• adjustments to uncertain tax positions that increased the overall income tax expense and the etr by 78 million and 68 respectively 

in fiscal 2021 the etr was primarily impacted by 

• impact of the hhs and other business divestitures which increased tax expense and increased the etr 344 million and 526 respectively the hhs tax gain increased tax expense and the etr as the tax basis of assets sold primarily goodwill was lower than the book basis 

• continued losses in countries where we are recording a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets primarily in belgium denmark italy france luxembourg and us and an impairment of the full german deferred tax asset which increased income tax expense and increased the etr by 1565 million and 2393 respectively 

• an increase in income tax and foreign tax credits which decreased income tax expense and decreased the etr by 319 million and 487 respectively 

• local losses on investments in luxembourg that increased the foreign rate differential and decreased the etr by 1226 million and 1875 respectively with an offsetting increase in the etr due to an increase in the valuation allowance of the same amount 

• the company recognized adjustments to uncertain tax positions that increased the overall income tax expense and the etr by 112 million and 172 respectively 

the internal revenue service the “irs” has examined or is examining the company’s federal income tax returns for fiscal 2008 through the tax year ended october 31 2018 with respect to csc’s fiscal 2008 through 2017 federal tax returns the company participated in settlement negotiations with the irs office of appeals the irs examined several issues for these tax years that resulted in various audit adjustments the company and the irs office of appeals have an agreement in principle as to various audit adjustments and we disagree with the irs’ disallowance of certain losses and deductions resulting from restructuring costs and tax planning strategies in previous years as we believe we will ultimately prevail on the technical merits of the disagreed items and are challenging them in the irs office of appeals or the us tax court these matters are not fully reserved and would result in a federal and state tax expense of approximately 458 million including estimated interest and penalties for the unreserved portion of these items and related cash cost if we do not prevail we have received notices of deficiency with respect to fiscal 2009 2010 2011 and 2013 and have timely filed petitions with the us tax court we do not expect the us tax court matters to be resolved in the next 12 months 

the company has agreed to extend the statute of limitations for fiscal years 2008 through 2010 to april 30 2022 for fiscal years 2014 through fiscal 2017 to february 28 2023 and for the tax years ended october 31 2017 and october 31 2018 to september 30 2023 the statute of limitations on assessments for fiscal years 2011 through 2013 has expired with the exception of a 6 million refund claim for 2012 for which the statute remains open however as previously noted fiscal years 2011 and 2013 are in the us tax court and consequently these years will remain open until the us tax court proceedings have concluded 

the company expects to reach resolution with regard to disagreed items for fiscal years 2009 through 2013 no earlier than fiscal 2025 and to reach resolution for fiscal years 2014 through 2017 within 12 months 

the company may settle certain other tax examinations for different amounts than the company has accrued as uncertain tax positions consequently the company may need to accrue and ultimately pay additional amounts or pay lower amounts than previously estimated and accrued when positions are settled in the future the company believes the outcomes that are reasonably possible within the next 12 months to result in a reduction in its liability for uncertain tax positions excluding interest penalties and tax carryforwards would be approximately 44 million 

earnings loss per share 

diluted earnings loss per share for fiscal 2022 was 281 as compared to 059 in fiscal 2021 the earnings per share increase was due to an increase of 882 million in net income 

diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2022 includes 099 per share of restructuring costs 007 per share of transaction separation and integrationrelated costs 135 per share of amortization of acquired intangible assets 009 per share of impairment losses 093 per share of net gains on dispositions 199 per share of pension and opeb actuarial and settlement gains 093 per share of debt extinguishment costs and 017 per share of tax adjustments primarily relating to tax adjustments to impair or recognize certain deferred tax assets and adjustments for changes in tax legislation 

diluted loss per share for fiscal 2021 includes 179 per share of restructuring costs 106 per share of transaction separation and integrationrelated costs 159 per share of amortization of acquired intangible assets 055 per share of impairment losses 422 per share of net gains on dispositions 157 per share of pension and opeb actuarial and settlement losses 012 per share of debt extinguishment costs and 055 per share of tax adjustment relating to a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets offset by changes in outside basis related to held for sale classification of the hps business 

ukraine  russia update 

subsequent to the end of the quarter dxc exited its domestic russian business this action achieves a significant portion of our commitment to exit russia the sale of this business has provided continuing employment opportunities for many former dxc employees who have chosen to stay in russia the exit of this market will reduce revenues by approximately 140 million annually the company is transitioning global business previously serviced by our dxc russian colleagues to international teams and expects to complete this process by the end of the second quarter 

dxcs ukraine business supported approximately 250 million of revenue predominantly serving international customers despite the ongoing conflict these revenues have only seen a minor impact stemming from the conflict our global teams have worked to augment their ukrainian colleagues and to continue to deliver for our customers through the conflict 

nongaap financial measures 

we present nongaap financial measures of performance which are derived from the statements of operations of dxc these nongaap financial measures include earnings before interest and taxes “ebit” adjusted ebit nongaap income before income taxes nongaap net income nongaap net income attributable to dxc common stockholders and nongaap eps and constant currency revenues 

we believe ebit adjusted ebit nongaap income before income taxes nongaap net income nongaap net income attributable to dxc common stockholders and nongaap eps provide investors with useful supplemental information about our operating performance after excluding certain categories of expenses 

we believe constant currency revenues provides investors with useful supplemental information about our revenues after excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations for currencies other than us dollars in the periods presented see below for a description of the methodology we use to present constant currency revenues 

one category of expenses excluded from adjusted ebit nongaap income before income tax nongaap net income nongaap net income attributable to dxc common stockholders and nongaap eps incremental amortization of intangible assets acquired through business combinations if included may result in a significant difference in period over period amortization expense on a gaap basis we exclude amortization of certain acquired intangible assets as these noncash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing andor size of acquisitions although dxc management excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets primarily customerrelated intangible assets from its nongaap expenses we believe that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and support revenue generation any future transactions may result in a change to the acquired intangible asset balances and associated amortization expense 

another category of expenses excluded from adjusted ebit nongaap income before income tax nongaap net income nongaap net income attributable to dxc common stockholders and nongaap eps is impairment losses which if included may result in a significant difference in period over period expense on a gaap basis we exclude impairment losses as these noncash amounts reflect generally an acceleration of what would be multiple periods of expense and are not expected to occur frequently further assets such as goodwill may be significantly impacted by market conditions outside of management’s control 

there are limitations to the use of the nongaap financial measures presented in this report one of the limitations is that they do not reflect complete financial results we compensate for this limitation by providing a reconciliation between our nongaap financial measures and the respective most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap additionally other companies including companies in our industry may calculate nongaap financial measures differently than we do limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes between companies selected references are made on a “constant currency basis” so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates thereby providing comparisons of operating performance from period to period financial results on a “constant currency basis” are nongaap measures calculated by translating current period activity into us dollars using the comparable prior period’s currency conversion rates this approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the us dollar please see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations—fiscal 2022 highlights” 

certain nongaap financial measures and the respective most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap include

liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents and cash flows 

as of march 31 2022 our cash and cash equivalents cash was 27 billion of which 13 billion was held outside of the us we maintain various multicurrency multientity crossborder physical and notional cash and pool arrangements with various counterparties to manage liquidity efficiently that enable participating subsidiaries to draw on the company’s pooled resources to meet liquidity needs 

a significant portion of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is not expected to be impacted by us federal income tax upon repatriation however a portion of this cash may still be subject to foreign and us state income tax consequences upon future remittance therefore if additional funds held outside the us are needed for our operations in the us we plan to repatriate these funds not designated as indefinitely reinvested 

we have 02 billion in cash held by foreign subsidiaries used for local operations that is subject to countryspecific limitations which may restrict or result in increased costs in the repatriation of these funds in addition other practical considerations may limit our use of consolidated cash including cash of 06 billion held in a german financial services subsidiary subject to regulatory requirements and 02 billion held by majority owned consolidated subsidiaries where thirdparties or public shareholders hold minority interests during the third quarter of fiscal 2022 we entered into an agreement to sell our german financial services subsidiary 

the following table summarizes our cash flow activity 



operating cash flow 

net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2022 was 1501 million as compared to 124 million during fiscal 2021 the increase of 1377 million was primarily due to an increase in net income net of adjustments of 1578 million partially offset by a 201 million unfavorable change in working capital due to higher working capital outflows during fiscal 2022  

the following table contains certain key working capital metrics 



investing cash flow 

net cash used in provided by investing activities was 60 million during fiscal 2022 as compared to 4665 million during fiscal 2021 the decrease of 4725 million was primarily due to a decrease in business dispositions of 4414 million the absence of proceeds from acquisitions and cash collections related to deferred purchase price receivables of 184 million and 159 million in fiscal 2021 and a decrease in proceeds from sale of assets of 64 million this was partially offset by proceeds from shortterm investing of 24 million in fiscal 2022 

financing cash flow 

net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2022 was 1818 million as compared to 5476 million during fiscal 2021 the 3658 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to decreased net repayments on longterm debt of 2624 million and net draws on commercial paper of 529 million in addition net repayments totaling 1500 million were made during fiscal 2021 on lines of credit that were not drawn against during fiscal 2022 and dividends of 53 million were paid in fiscal 2021 but not paid during fiscal 2022 this was partially offset by share repurchases of 628 million in fiscal 2022 an increase in payments for debt extinguishment costs of 303 million an increase in payments on capital leases and borrowings for asset financing of 60 million and an increase in payments for other financing activities net of 58 million primarily due to an 85 million repayment of liability resulting from a financing transaction entered in fiscal 2017 

debt financing 

the following table summarizes our total debt 



the 05 billion decrease in total debt during fiscal 2022 was primarily attributed to the retirement of all the remaining 319 million of the 445 senior notes due fiscal 2023 using the proceeds from the sale of our hps business and the repurchase of the 33 million of the 4125 senior notes due fiscal 2026 more than 550 million of net finance lease liabilities and borrowings for assets acquired under longterm financing were also repaid using the proceeds from the divestitures of other businesses and existing cash on hand the decrease was partially offset by the issuance of euro and us dollar senior notes of which proceeds were used to repay term loans and senior notes as discussed below 

euro senior notes issuance 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2022 we issued i €750 million aggregate principal amount of our 0450 senior notes due fiscal 2028 and ii €600 million aggregate principal amount of our 0950 senior notes due fiscal 2032 collectively the “euro notes” the proceeds from the euro notes were applied principally to the repayment in full of the €400 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding borrowings under our eurodenominated term loan facility the repayment of our us dollardenominated 425 senior notes due fiscal 2025 and the repayment of our sterlingdenominated 275 senior notes due fiscal 2025 

us dollar senior notes issuance 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2022 we issued i 700 million aggregate principal amount of our 180 senior notes due fiscal 2027 and ii 650 million aggregate principal amount of our 2375 senior notes due fiscal 2029 collectively the “usd notes” the proceeds from the usd notes were used for the repayment of our remaining 4125 senior notes due fiscal 2026 our 475 senior notes due fiscal 2028 and our 745 senior notes due fiscal 2030 

we were in compliance with all financial covenants associated with our borrowings as of march 31 2022 and march 31 2021 

as of march 31 2022 our credit ratings were as follows 



for information on the risk s of ratings downgrades see part i item 1a  risk factors subsection titled failure to maintain our credit rating and ability to manage working capital refinance and raise additional capital for future needs could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing cost and access to capital markets 

liquidity 

we expect our existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our normal operating requirements for the next 12 months we expect to continue using cash generated by operations as a primary source of liquidity however should we require funds greater than that generated from our operations to fund discretionary investment activities such as business acquisitions we have the ability to raise capital through debt financing including the issuance of capital market debt instruments such as commercial paper and bonds in addition we currently utilize and will further utilize accounts receivable sales facilities and our crosscurrency cash pool for liquidity needs there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain debt financing if required on terms and conditions acceptable to us if at all in the future 

our exposure to operational liquidity risk is primarily from longterm contracts which require significant investment of cash during the initial phases of the contracts the recovery of these investments is over the life of the contract and is dependent upon our performance as well as customer acceptance 

the following table summarizes our total liquidity 



during november 2021 we amended our revolving credit facility to among other things decrease available borrowings from 40 billion to 30 billion 

share repurchases 

during fiscal 2018 our board of dire ctors authorized the repurchase of up to 20 billion of our common stock and during fiscal 2019 our board of directors approved an incremental 20 billion share repurchase on february 2 2022 we announced our intention to repurchase incrementally up to 10 billion of our outstanding shares of common stock in the open market this program became effective on april 3 2017 with no end date established during fiscal 2022 we repurchased 18818934 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 634 million s ee note 16  stockholders equity for more information 

dividends 

to maintain our financial flexibility we continued to suspend payment of quarterly dividends for fiscal 2022 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business we are a party to arrangements that include guarantees the receivables sales facility and certain other financial instruments with offbalance sheet risk such as letters of credit and surety bonds we also use performance letters of credit to support various risk management insurance policies no liabilities related to these arrangements are reflected in the companys balance sheets see note 6  receivables and note 23  commitments and contingencies for additional information regarding these offbalance sheet arrangements 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of march 31 2022 were as follows 



  

1 amounts represent scheduled principal payments of longterm debt and mandatory redemption of preferred stock of a consolidated subsidiary 

2 amounts represent expected undiscounted cash payments see note 7  leases for more information 

3 includes longterm purchase agreements with certain software hardware telecommunication and other service providers and excludes agreements that are cancellable without penalty if we do not meet the specified service minimums we may have an obligation to pay the service provider a portion of or the entire shortfall see note 23  commitments and contingencies for more information 

4 the transition tax resulted in recording a total transition tax obligation of 276 million of which 284 million was recorded as income tax liability and 8 million recorded as a reduction in our unrecognized tax benefits which has been omitted from this table the transition tax is payable over eight years 8 of net tax liability in each of years 15 15 in year 6 20 in year 7 and 25 in year 8 we have made our first four payments see note 13  income taxes for additional information about the transition tax and the estimated liability related to unrecognized tax benefits 

5 amounts represent scheduled interest payments on longterm debt and scheduled dividend payments associated with the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of a consolidated subsidiary excluding contingent dividends associated with the participation and variable appreciation premium features

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities these estimates may change in the future if underlying assumptions or factors change accordingly actual results could differ materially from our estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions we consider the following policies to be critical because of their complexity and the high degree of judgment involved in implementing them revenue recognition income taxes business combinations defined benefit plans and valuation of assets we have discussed the selection of our critical accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 

revenue recognition 

most of our revenues are recognized based on objective criteria and do not require significant estimates that may change over time however some arrangements may require significant estimates including contracts which include multiple performance obligations  

contracts with multiple performance obligations 

many of our contracts re quire us to provide a range of services or performance obligations to our customers which may include a combination of services products or both and may also contain leases embedded in those arrangements as a result significant judgment may be required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the elements specified in contracts with multiple performance obligations should be treated as separate performance obligations for revenue recognition purposes and when considered appropriate how the total transaction price should be allocated among the performance obligations and any lease components and the timing of revenue recognition for each for contracts with multiple performance obligations and lease components we allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation and lease component based on the relative standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract other than software sales involving multiple performance obligations the primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin approach under which we forecast our expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that distinct good or service certain of our contracts involve the sale of dxc proprietary software postcontract customer support and other softwarerelated services the standalone selling price generally is determined for each performance obligation using an adjusted market assessment approach based on the price charged where each deliverable is sold separately in certain limited cases typically for software licenses when the historical selling price is highly variable the residual approach is used this approach allocates revenue to the performance obligation equal to the difference between the total transaction price and the observable standalone selling prices for the other performance obligations these methods involve significant judgments and estimates that we assess periodically by considering market and entityspecific factors such as type of customer features of the products or services and market conditions 

once the total revenues have been allocated to the various performance obligations and lease components revenues for each are recognized based on the relevant revenue recognition method for each estimates of total revenues at contract inception often differ materially from actual revenues due to volume differences changes in technology or other factors which may not be foreseen at inception 

contract modifications 

a contract modification is a legally binding change to the scope price or both of an existing contract contract modifications are reviewed to determine whether they should be accounted for as part of the original contract the termination of an existing contract and the creation of a new contract or as a separate contract and whether they modify an embedded lease this determination requires significant judgment which could impact the timing of revenue recognition 

costs to obtain contracts with customers 

accounting for the costs to obtain contracts with customers requires significant judgments and estimates with regards to the determination of sales commission payments that qualify for deferral of costs and the related amortization period most of our sales commission plans are quotabased and payments are made by achieving targets related to a large number of new and renewed contracts certain sales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer we defer and amortize these costs on a straightline basis over an average period of benefit of five years which is determined and regularly assessed by considering the length of our customer contracts our technology and other factors significant changes in these estimates or impairment may result if material contracts terminate earlier than the expected benefit period or if there are material changes in the average contract period 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes analyzing our income tax reserves the determination of the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets and any corresponding adjustment of valuation allowances in addition our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions 

as a global enterprise our etr is affected by many factors including our global mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates the extent to which our nonus earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the us changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets changes in tax regulations acquisitions dispositions and the tax characteristics of our income we cannot predict with certainty what our etr will be in the future because there is uncertainty regarding these factors future events such as changes in tax laws tax regulations or interpretations of such laws or regulations could have an impact on the provision for income tax and the effective tax rate any such changes could significantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements in the year these changes occur 

the majority of our global unremitted foreign earnings have been taxed in the us or would be exempt from us tax upon repatriation such earnings and all current foreign earnings are not indefinitely reinvested the following foreign earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested approximately 495 million that could be subject to us federal tax when repatriated to the us under section 1245a5b of the final treasury regulations and our accumulated earnings in india as of march 31 2021 a portion of these indefinitely reinvested earnings may be subject to foreign and us state tax consequences when remitted the company will continue to evaluate its position based on its strategic objectives and future cash needs 

considerations impacting the recoverability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates in determining whether the deferred tax assets are realizable we consider all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences taxable income in prior carryback years projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent results of financial operations we recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of approximately 21 billion as of march 31 2022 due to uncertainties related to the ability to utilize these assets however valuation allowances are subject to change in future reporting periods due to changes in various factors such as when inputs or estimates used in determining valuation allowances significantly change or upon the receipt of new information 

we determine whether it is more likely than not a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit is recorded in our financial statements a tax position is measured as the portion of the tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information we may be required to change our provision for income taxes when the ultimate treatment of certain items is challenged or agreed to by taxing authorities 

the finance act 2021 in the uk took effect after royal assent was received in june 2021 the finance act 2021 included increases in the corporation tax and diverted profits tax rates beginning on april 1 2023 establishes a new temporary 130 super deduction for first year capital allowances and temporarily extends the carryback of trading losses the increase in the uk corporate tax rate and super deduction have been factored into the calculation of our income tax provision 

business combinations 

we account for the acquisition of a business using the acquisition method of accounting which requires us to estimate the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed this includes acquired intangible assets such as customerrelated intangibles the liabilities assumed and contingent consideration if any liabilities assumed may include litigation and other contingency reserves existing at the time of acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining the related fair values independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities such appraisals are based on significant estimates provided by us such as forecasted revenues or profits utilized in determining the fair value of contractrelated acquired intangible assets or liabilities significant changes in assumptions and estimates subsequent to completing the allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired as well as differences in actual and estimated results could result in material impacts to our financial results adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in earnings additional information related to the acquisition date fair value of acquired assets and liabilities obtained during the allocation period not to exceed one year may result in changes to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the business acquired 

defined benefit plans 

the computation of our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations is dependent on various assumptions inherent in the application of the actuarial methods are key assumptions including discount rates expected longterm rates of return on plan assets mortality rates rates of compensation increases and medical cost trend rates our management evaluates these assumptions annually and updates assumptions as necessary the fair value of assets is determined based on observable inputs for similar assets or on significant unobservable inputs if observable inputs are not available two of the most significant assumptions are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate 

our weighted average rates used were 



the assumption for the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is impacted by the expected asset mix of the plan judgments regarding the correlation between historical excess returns and future excess returns and expected investment expenses the discount rate assumption is based on current market rates for highquality fixed income debt instruments with maturities similar to the expected duration of the benefit payment period the following table provides the impact changes in the weightedaverage assumptions would have had on our net periodic pension benefits and settlement and contractual termination charges for fiscal 2022 



valuation of assets 

we review longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill for impairment in accordance with our accounting policy disclosed in note 1  summary of significant accounting policies assessing the fair value of assets involves significant estimates and assumptions including estimation of future cash flows the timing of such cash flows and discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in projecting future cash flows the valuation of longlived and intangible assets involves management estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of assets particularly purchased intangible assets these estimates are subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and forecasts 

evaluation of goodwill for impairment requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the identification of reporting units involves consideration of components of the operating segments and whether or not there is discrete financial information available that is regularly reviewed by management additionally we consider whether or not it is reasonable to aggregate any of the identified components that have similar economic characteristics the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors changes in these estimates and assumptions include a significant change in the business climate established business plans operating performance indicators or competition which could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach using performancemetric market multiples the discount rate used in an income approach is based on our weightedaverage cost of capital and may be adjusted for the relevant risks associated with businessspecific characteristics and any uncertainty related to a reporting units ability to execute on the projected future cash flows 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as a multinational company we are exposed to certain market risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates changes in foreign currency exchange rates can impact our foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions in foreign currency whereas changes in benchmark interest rates can impact interest expense associated with our floating interest rate debt and the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks including operating and financing activities and the use of derivative instruments we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

presented below is a description of our risks together with a sensitivity analysis of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates the foreign currency model incorporates the impact of diversification from holding multiple currencies and the correlation of revenues costs and any related shortterm contract financing in the same currency in order to determine the impact of changes in interest rates on our future results of operations and cash flows we calculated the increase or decrease in the index underlying these rates we estimate the fair value of our longterm debt primarily using an expected present value technique using interest rates offered to us for instruments with similar terms and remaining maturities these analyses reflect managements view of changes that are reasonably possible to occur over a oneyear period 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to both favorable and unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates in the ordinary course of business we enter into contracts denominated in foreign currencies exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising from these contracts is analyzed during the contract bidding process we generally manage these contracts by incurring costs in the same currency in which revenues are received and any related shortterm contract financing requirements are met by borrowing in the same currency thus by generally matching revenues costs and borrowings to the same currency we are able to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency risk to earnings however due to our increased use of offshore labor centers we have become more exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we experienced significant foreign currency fluctuations during fiscal 2022 due primarily to the volatility of the euro british pound canadian dollar and australian dollar in relation to the us dollar significant foreign currency fluctuations during fiscal 2021 was due primarily to the volatility of the australian dollar british pound and euro in relation to the us dollar 

we have policies and procedures to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency by using shortterm foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities including intercompany accounts and loans for accounting purposes these foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedges and changes in their fair value a re reported in current period earnings within other expense income net in the statements of operations we also use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risk related to certain indian rupee denominated intercompany obligations and forecasted transactions for accounting purposes these foreign currency forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges with critical terms that match the hedged items therefore the changes in fair value of these forward contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income net of taxes in the statements of comprehensive income and subsequently classified into net income in the period the hedged transactions are recognized in net income 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than us dollar see note 21  revenue during fiscal 2022 approximately 71 of our revenues were generated outside of the united states for the year ended march 31 2022 a hypothetical 10 increase decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would have decreased increased revenues by approximately 71 or 11 billion the majority of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency and as a result there would not be a material change to our income from continuing operations before taxes as such in the view of management the resulting impact would not be material to our results of operations or cash flows 

interest rate risk 

as of march 31 2022 we had outstanding debt with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of 50 billion of which 04 billion was floating interest rate debt as of march 31 2022 an assumed 10 unfavorable change in interest rates would not be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flows a change in interest rates related to our longterm debt would not have a material impact on our balance sheet as we do not record our debt at fair value

risks related to our business 

our business and financial results have been adversely affected and could continue to be materially adversely affected by the covid19 crisis 

the covid19 crisis has caused disruptions in global economies financial and commodities markets and rapid shifts in governmental and public health policies in the countries where we operate or our customers are located or the industries in which we and our customers compete the covid19 crisis and the actions taken by governments businesses and individuals to curtail the spread of the disease have negatively impacted and are expected to continue to negatively impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition the extent of such impact will depend on future developments including the duration and spread of covid19 the speed at which the vaccine is distributed the number of individuals in general who agree to receive the vaccine along with the number of our employees receiving the vaccine in addition the recent covid19 strain mutations may also hamper the vaccines effectiveness 

negative impacts that have occurred or may occur in the future include disruptions or restrictions on our employees’ ability to work effectively as well as temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers or our subcontractors or the requirements to deliver our services remotely a significant portion of our application outsourcing and software development activities is in india which is currently experiencing a high rate of covid19 infections continued public health threat and government responses could materially adversely affect our operations and the delivery of our services negative impacts from covid19 could potentially affect our ability to perform under our contracts with customers cost increases may not be recoverable from customers or covered by insurance which could impact our profitability if a business interruption occurs and we are unsuccessful in our continuing efforts to minimize the impact of these events our business results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

in addition the covid19 crisis has resulted in a widespread global health crisis that is adversely affecting the economies and financial markets of many countries which could result in an economic downturn that may negatively affect demand for our services including the financial failure of some of our customers this economic downturn depending upon its severity and duration could also lead to the deterioration of worldwide credit and financial markets that could limit our customers’ ability or willingness to pay us in a timely manner and our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures result in losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties and result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults 

our financial results may also be materially and adversely impacted by a variety of factors related to covid19 that have not yet been determined including potential impairments of goodwill and other assets and changes to our contingent liabilities for which actual amounts may materially exceed management estimates and our calculation of global tax liabilities even after the covid19 crisis has subsided depending upon its duration and potential recurrence and the governmental policies in response thereto we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact including any recession that may occur or be continuing as a result 

we continue to evaluate the extent to which the covid19 crisis has impacted us and our employees customers and suppliers and the extent to which it and other emerging developments will impact us and our employees customers and suppliers in the future we caution investors that any of the factors mentioned above could have material and adverse impacts on our current and future business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

to the extent the covid19 crisis and the resulting economic disruption continue to adversely affect our business and financial results it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “risk factors” section such as those relating to our level of indebtedness our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness and to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness and our counterparty credit risk 

we may not succeed in our strategic objectives which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our transformation journey focuses on our customers optimizing costs and seizing the market our strategic priorities include an initiative to assist dxc customers across a broader range of their information technology needs which we refer to as “the enterprise technology stack” we may not be able to implement our strategic priorities and progress on our transformation journey in accordance with our expectations for a variety of reasons including failure to execute on our plans in a timely fashion lack of adequate skills ineffective management inadequate incentives customer resistance to new initiatives inability to control costs or maintain competitive offerings we also cannot be certain that executing on our strategy will generate the benefits we expect if we fail to execute successfully on our strategic priorities or if we pursue strategic priorities that prove to be unsuccessful our business financial position results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected 

we could be held liable for damages our reputation could suffer or we may experience service interruptions from security breaches cyberattacks other security incidents or disclosure of confidential information or personal data which could cause significant financial loss 

as a provider of it services to private and public sector customers operating in a number of industries and countries we store and process increasingly large amounts of data for our customers including sensitive and personally identifiable information we also manage it infrastructure of our own and of customers we possess valuable proprietary information including copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and we collect and store certain personal and financial information from customers and employees our security measures designed to identify and protect against security incidents may fail to detect prevent or adequately respond to a future threat incident security incidents can result from unintentional events or deliberate attacks by insiders such as employees contractors or service providers or third parties including criminals competitors nationstates and hacktivists these incidents can result in significant disruption to our business through an impact on our operations or those of our clients employees vendors or other partners loss of data including proprietary confidential or otherwise sensitive or valuable information for us our clients employees vendors or partners reputational damage injury to customer relationships liability whether contractual or otherwise for any of the above including monetary damages remediation costs regulatory actions from regulators any of which or a combination of which could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition the regulatory environment related to information security and data privacy is evolving rapidly and the company will need to expend time and resources to ensure compliance with these evolving regulations and failure to understand and comply with these regulations can have an impact on the company its results of operations and financial condition 

the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches and cyberattacks including by nationstate actors reflects an external environment that is increasingly hostile to information and corporate security like other companies we face an evolving array of information security and data security threats that pose risks to us and our customers we can also be harmed by attacks on third parties such as denialofservice attacks we see regular unauthorized efforts to access our systems which we evaluate for severity and frequency for example in july 2020 certain systems of our subsidiary xchanging experienced a ransomware attack while incidents experienced thus far have not resulted in significant disruption to our business it is possible that we could suffer a severe attack or incident with potentially material and adverse effects on our business reputation customer relations results of operations or financial condition 

in the event of a security incident we could be exposed to regulatory actions customer attrition due to reputational concerns or otherwise containment and remediation expenses and claims brought by our customers or others for breaching contractual confidentiality and security provisions or data protection or privacy laws we must expend capital and other resources to protect against security incidents including attempted security breaches and cyberattacks and to alleviate problems caused by successful breaches or attacks the cost potential monetary damages and operational consequences of responding to security incidents and implementing remediation measures could be significant and may be in excess of insurance policy limits or be not covered by our insurance at all 

we rely on internal and external information and technological systems to manage our operations and are exposed to risk of loss resulting from security incidents including breaches in the security or other failures of these systems security incidents such as through an advanced persistent threat attack or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers could expose us to risk of loss of this information regulatory scrutiny actions and penalties extensive contractual liability and other litigation reputational harm and a loss of customer confidence which could potentially have an adverse impact on future business with current and potential customers moreover failure to maintain effective internal accounting controls related to data security breaches and cybersecurity in general could impact our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny 

advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments may result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms that we use to protect our data and that of customers including sensitive customer transaction data a party whether an insider or third party operating outside the company who is able to circumvent our security measures or those of our contractors partners or vendors could access our systems and misappropriate proprietary information the confidential data of our customers employees or business partners or cause interruption in our or their operations 

experienced computer programmers hackers or insiders may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers have deployed and may continue to develop and deploy ransomware malware and other malicious software programs through phishing and other methods that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of these products in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications produced or procured from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the security and operation of our systems or harm those of third parties with whom we may interact the costs to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems including ransomware malware bugs malicious software programs and other security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers which may impede our sales distribution or other critical functions 

increasing cybersecurity data privacy and information security obligations around the world could also impose additional regulatory pressures on our customers’ businesses and indirectly on our operations or lead to inquiries or enforcement actions in the united states we are seeing increasing obligations and expectations from federal and nonfederal customers in response some of our customers have sought and may continue to seek to contractually impose certain strict data privacy and information security obligations on us some of our customer contracts may not limit our liability for the loss of confidential information if we are unable to adequately address these concerns our business and results of operations could suffer 

compliance with new privacy and security laws requirements and regulations may result in cost increases due to expanded compliance obligations potential systems changes the development of additional administrative processes and increased enforcement actions litigation fines and penalties the regulatory landscape in these areas continues to evolve rapidly and there is a risk that the company could fail to address or comply with the fast changing regulatory environment which could lead to regulatory or other actions which result in material liability for the company for example in 2020 the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” came into force and provides new data privacy rights for california consumers and new operational requirements for covered companies the ccpa also includes a private right of action for certain data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation failure to comply with the ccpa could result in civil penalties of 2500 for each violation or 7500 for each intentional violation additionally a new privacy law the california privacy rights act “cpra” was approved by california voters in the november 3 2020 election the cpra which takes effect on january 1 2023 and significantly modifies the ccpa potentially results in further uncertainty and could require us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply some observers have noted the ccpa and cpra could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the united states which could also increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business for example the ccpa has encouraged “copycat” laws in other states across the country such as in virginia new hampshire illinois and nebraska this legislation may add additional complexity variation in requirements restrictions and potential legal risk require additional investment in resources to compliance programs and could impact strategies and availability of previously useful data and could result in increased compliance costs andor changes in business practices and policies 

in addition the data protection landscape in the european union “eu” is continually evolving resulting in possible significant operational costs for internal compliance and risks to our business the eu adopted the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 and contains numerous requirements and changes from previously existing eu laws including more robust obligations on data processors and heavier documentation requirements for data protection compliance programs by companies 

among other requirements the gdpr regulates the transfer of personal data subject to the gdpr to third countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection to such personal data including the united states recent legal developments in europe have created complexity and uncertainty regarding such transfers for instance on july 16 2020 the court of justice of the european union the “cjeu” invalidated the euus privacy shield framework the “privacy shield” under which personal data could be transferred from the eea to us entities who had selfcertified under the privacy shield scheme while the cjeu upheld the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses a standard form of contract approved by the european commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism and potential alternative to the privacy shield it made clear that reliance on such clauses alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances use of the standard contractual clauses must now be assessed on a casebycase basis taking into account the legal regime applicable in the destination country including in particular applicable surveillance laws and rights of individuals and additional measures andor contractual provisions may need to be put in place however the nature of these additional measures is currently uncertain the cjeu went on to state that if a competent supervisory authority believes that the standard contractual clauses cannot be complied with in the destination country and that the required level of protection cannot be secured by other means such supervisory authority is under an obligation to suspend or prohibit that transfer 

failure to comply with the gdpr could result in penalties for noncompliance including possible fines of up to the greater of €20 million and 4 of our global annual turnover for the preceding financial year for the most serious violations as well as the right to compensation for financial or nonfinancial damages claimed by individuals under article 82 of the gdpr 

further in march 2017 the united kingdom “uk” formally notified the european council of its intention to leave the eu pursuant to article 50 of the treaty on european union “brexit” the uk ceased to be an eu member state on january 31 2020 but enacted a data protection act substantially implementing the gdpr effective in may 2018 which was further amended to align more substantially with the gdpr following brexit it is unclear how uk data protection laws or regulations will develop in the medium to longer term since the beginning of 2021 we must comply with both the gdpr and the uk gdpr with each regime having the ability to fine up to the greater of €20 million in the case of the gdpr or £17 million in the case of the uk gdpr and 4 of total annual revenue 

while we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations as well as internal privacy policies any failure or perceived failure to comply or any misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information may result in proceedings or actions against us by government or other entities private lawsuits against us including class actions or the loss of customers which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations 

portions of our infrastructure also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and be expensive timeconsuming disruptive and resource intensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could reduce our revenues increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

our strategic transactions may prove unsuccessful and our profitability may be materially and adversely affected 

at any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more transactions including acquisitions divestitures or spinoffs strategic partnerships or other transaction involving one or more of our businesses any of these transactions could be material to our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we may ultimately determine not to proceed with any transaction for commercial financial strategic or other reasons as a result we may not realize benefits expected from exploring one or more strategic transactions may realize benefits further in the future or those benefits may ultimately be significantly smaller than anticipated which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition we may fail to complete transactions closing transactions is subject to uncertainties and risks including the risk that we may be unable to satisfy conditions to closing such as regulatory and financing conditions and the absence of material adverse changes to our business 

for acquisitions our inability to successfully integrate the operations we acquire and leverage these operations to generate substantial cost savings as well as our inability to avoid revenue erosion and earnings decline could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial position in order to achieve successful acquisitions we will need to 

• integrate the operations and business cultures as well as the accounting financial controls management information technology human resources and other administrative systems of acquired businesses with existing operations and systems 

• maintain thirdparty relationships previously established by acquired companies 

• attract and retain senior management and key personnel at acquired businesses and 

• manage new business lines as well as acquisitionrelated workload 

existing contractual restrictions may limit our ability to engage in certain integration activities for varying periods we may not be successful in meeting these or any other challenges encountered in connection with historical and future acquisitions even if we successfully integrate we cannot predict with certainty if or when these cost and revenue synergies growth opportunities and benefits will occur or the extent to which they actually will be achieved in addition the quantification of previously announced synergies expected to result from an acquisition is based on significant estimates and assumptions that are subjective in nature and inherently uncertain realization of any benefits and synergies could be affected by a number of factors beyond our control including without limitation general economic conditions increased operating costs regulatory developments and other risks in addition future acquisitions could require dilutive issuances of equity securities andor the assumption of contingent liabilities the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

divestiture transactions such as the usps separation the sale of hhs business to veritas capital or the sale of the hps business to dedalus also involve significant challenges and risks including 

• the potential loss of key customers suppliers vendors and other key business partners 

• declining employee morale and retention issues affecting employees which may result from changes in compensation or changes in management reporting relationships future prospects or perceived expectations 

• difficulty making new and strategic hires of new employees 

• diversion of management time and a shift of focus from operating the businesses to transaction execution considerations 

• customers delaying or deferring decisions or ending their relationships 

• the need to provide transition services which may result in stranded costs and the diversion of resources and focus 

• the need to separate operations systems including accounting management information human resource and other administrative systems technologies products and personnel which is an inherently risky and potentially lengthy and costly process 

• the inefficiencies and lack of control that may result if such separation is delayed or not implemented effectively and unforeseen difficulties and expenditures that may arise as a result including potentially significant stranded costs 

• our desire to maintain an investment grade credit rating may cause us to use cash proceeds if any from any divestitures or other strategic transactions that we might otherwise have used for other purposes in order to reduce our financial leverage 

• the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or otherwise satisfy conditions required in order consummate any such transactions 

• our dependence on accounting financial reporting operating metrics and similar systems controls and processes of divested businesses could lead to challenges in preparing our consolidated financial statements or maintaining effective financial control over financial reporting and 

• including contractual terms limiting our ability to compete for or perform certain contracts or services 

we have also entered into and intend to identify and enter into additional strategic partnerships with other industry participants that will allow us to expand our business however we may be unable to identify attractive strategic partnership candidates or complete these partnerships on terms favorable to us in addition if we are unable to successfully implement our partnership strategies or our strategic partners do not fulfill their obligations or otherwise prove disadvantageous to our business our investments in these partnerships and our anticipated business expansion could be adversely affected 

our ability to continue to develop and expand our service offerings to address emerging business demands and technological trends including our ability to sell differentiated services up the enterprise technology stack may impact our future growth if we are not successful in meeting these business challenges our results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected 

our ability to implement solutions for our customers incorporating new developments and improvements in technology that translate into productivity improvements for our customers and our ability to develop digital and other new service offerings that meet current and prospective customers needs as well as evolving industry standards are critical to our success the markets we serve are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change which has resulted in deflationary pressure in the price of services which in turn can adversely impact our margins our competitors may develop solutions or services that make our offerings obsolete or may force us to decrease prices on our services which can result in lower margins our ability to develop and implement up to date solutions utilizing new technologies that meet evolving customer needs in digital cloud information technology outsourcing consulting industry software and solutions and application services markets and in areas such as artificial intelligence automation internet of things and asaservice solutions in a timely or costeffective manner will impact our ability to retain and attract customers and our future revenue growth and earnings if we are unable to continue to execute our strategy and build our business across the enterprise technology stack in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving environment or if we are unable to commercialize such services and solutions expand and scale them with sufficient speed and versatility our growth productivity objectives and profit margins could be negatively affected 

  

technological developments may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our customers some of these technologies have reduced and replaced some of our traditional services and solutions and may continue to do so in the future this has caused and may in the future cause customers to delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies such delays can negatively impact our results of operations if the pace and level of spending on new technologies by some of our customers is not sufficient to make up any shortfall by other customers our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas if we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry developments or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation our services and solutions our results of operations and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be negatively affected 

our ability to compete in certain markets we serve is dependent on our ability to continue to expand our capacity in certain offshore locations however as our presence in these locations increases we are exposed to risks inherent to these locations which may adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

a significant portion of our application outsourcing and software development activities has been shifted to india and we plan to continue to expand our presence there and in other lowercost locations as a result we are exposed to the risks inherent in operating in india or other locations including 1 the current high rate of covid19 infections and government responses including renewed lockdowns2 a highly competitive labor market for skilled workers which may result in significant increases in labor costs as well as shortages of qualified workers in the future and 3 the possibility that the us federal government or the european union may enact legislation that creates significant disincentives for customers to locate certain of their operations offshore which would reduce the demand for the services we provide in such locations and may adversely impact our cost structure and profitability in addition india has experienced and other countries may experience political instability civil unrest and hostilities with neighboring countries negative or uncertain political climates in countries or locations where we operate such as ukraine and russia including but not limited to military activity or civil hostilities criminal activities and other acts of violence infrastructure disruption natural disasters or other conditions could adversely affect our operations 

we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended fcpa and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions we pursue opportunities in certain parts of the world that experience government corruption and in certain circumstances compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices our internal policies mandate compliance with all applicable antibribery laws we require our employees partners subcontractors agents and others to comply with the fcpa and other antibribery laws there is no assurance that our policies or procedures will protect us against liability under the fcpa or other laws for actions taken by our employees and intermediaries if we are found to be liable for fcpa violations either due to our own acts or our omissions or due to the acts or omissions of others we could suffer from severe criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations or cash flows in addition detecting investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of the fcpa or other antibribery violations is expensive and could consume significant time and attention of our senior management 

our credit rating and ability to manage working capital refinance and raise additional capital for future needs could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing cost and access to capital markets 

we currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with moodys investors service fitch rating services and standard  poors ratings services our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time rating agencies may review the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control including potential new standards requiring the agencies to reassess rating practices and methodologies ratings agencies may consider changes in credit ratings based on changes in expectations about future profitability and cash flows even if shortterm liquidity expectations are not negatively impacted if changes in our credit ratings were to occur it could result in higher interest costs under certain of our credit facilities it would also cause our future borrowing costs to increase and limit our access to capital markets for example we currently fund a portion of our working capital requirements in the us and european commercial paper markets any downgrade below our current rating would absent changes to current market liquidity substantially reduce or eliminate our ability to access that source of funding and could otherwise negatively impact the perception of our company by lenders and other third parties in addition certain of our major contracts provide customers with a right of termination in certain circumstances in the event of a rating downgrade below investment grade there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position and access to capital markets  

our liquidity is a function of our ability to successfully generate cash flows from a combination of efficient operations and continuing operating improvements access to capital markets and funding from third parties in addition like many multinational regulated enterprises our operations are subject to a variety of tax foreign exchange and regulatory capital requirements in different jurisdictions that have the effect of limiting delaying or increasing the cost of moving cash between jurisdictions or using our cash for certain purposes our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity going forward is subject to the general liquidity of and ongoing changes in the credit markets as well as general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other market factors that are beyond our control an increase in our borrowing costs limitations on our ability to access the global capital and credit markets or a reduction in our liquidity can adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

information regarding our credit ratings is included in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k under the caption liquidity and capital resources 

we have indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have indebtedness totaling approximately 55 billion as of march 31 2021 including capital lease obligations we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future for many reasons including to fund acquisitions our existing indebtedness together with the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the restrictive covenants contained in or expected to be contained in the documents evidencing such indebtedness could have significant consequences on our future operations including 

• events of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt instruments which could if material and not cured result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable or require us to negotiate an amendment to financial or other covenants that could cause us to incur additional fees and expenses 

• subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases in our outstanding variablerate 

indebtedness that could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

• increasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt which could increase future debt costs 

and limit the future availability for debt financing 

• debt service may reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors 

• increasing our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions and 

• causing us to reduce or eliminate our return of cash to our stockholders including via dividends and share repurchases 

in addition we could be unable to refinance our outstanding indebtedness on reasonable terms or at all 

our ability to meet our payment and other obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future this to some extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that current or future borrowings will be sufficient to meet our current debt obligations and to fund other liquidity needs 

in july 2017 the uk’s financial conduct authority “fca” which regulates libor announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 the us federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions is considering replacing libor with the secured overnight financing rate sofr a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities 

certain of our financing agreements include language to determine a replacement rate for libor if necessary however if libor ceases to exist we may need to renegotiate some financing agreements extending beyond 2021 that utilize libor as a factor in determining the interest rate we are evaluating the potential impact of the eventual replacement of the libor benchmark interest rate however we are not able to predict whether libor will cease to be available after 2021 whether sofr will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of libor or what the impact of such a possible transition to sofr may be on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our primary markets are highly competitive if we are unable to compete in these highly competitive markets our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

our competitors include large technically competent and wellcapitalized companies some of which have emerged as a result of industry consolidation as well as “pureplay” companies that have a single product focus this competition may place downward pressure on operating margins in our industry particularly for technology outsourcing contract extensions or renewals as a result we may not be able to maintain our current operating margins or achieve favorable operating margins for technology outsourcing contracts extended or renewed in the future if we fail to effectively reduce our cost structure during periods with declining margins our results of operations may be adversely affected 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors our competitiveness is based on factors including technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation range of products and services account relationships customer training service and support and security if we are unable to compete based on such factors we could lose customers or we may experience reduced profitability from our customers and our results of operations and business prospects could be harmed we have a large portfolio of services and we need to allocate financial personnel and other resources across all services while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of our service lines as a result we may invest less in certain business areas than our competitors do and competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available to them compared to the resources allocated to our services industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate additionally competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with existing or potential customers or suppliers 

companies with whom we have alliances in certain areas may be or become competitors in other areas in addition companies with whom we have alliances also may acquire or form alliances with competitors which could reduce their business with us if we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with alliance partners our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we face aggressive price competition and may have to lower prices to stay competitive while simultaneously seeking to maintain or improve revenue and gross margin this price competition may continue to increase from emerging companies that sell products and services into the same markets in which we operate in addition competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lowercost markets in which we compete or who can obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer if we experience pressure from competitors to lower our prices we may have lower than expected profit margins and lost business opportunities if we are unable to match the price declines our cash flows results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressures 

if we are unable to accurately estimate the cost of services and the timeline for completion of contracts the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected 

our commercial contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis our bids are based upon among other items the expected cost to provide the services we generally provide services under time and materials contracts unit price contracts fixedprice contracts and multipleelement software sales we are dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects and the marketplace and to generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services required by the contract and to complete the contracts in a timely manner we face a number of risks when pricing our contracts as many of our projects entail the coordination of operations and workforces in multiple locations and utilizing workforces with different skill sets and competencies across geographically diverse service locations in addition revenues from some of our contracts are recognized using the percentageofcompletion method which requires estimates of total costs at completion fees earned on the contract or both this estimation process particularly due to the technical nature of the services being performed and the longterm nature of certain contracts is complex and involves significant judgment adjustments to original estimates are often required as work progresses experience is gained and additional information becomes known even though the scope of the work required under the contract may not change if we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected 

some ito services agreements contain pricing provisions that permit a customer to request a benchmark study by a mutually acceptable third party the benchmarking process typically compares the contractual price of services against the price of similar services offered by other specified providers in a peer comparison group subject to agreedupon adjustment and normalization factors generally if the benchmarking study shows that the pricing differs from the peer group outside a specified range and the difference is not due to the unique requirements of the customer then the parties will negotiate in good faith appropriate adjustments to the pricing this may result in the reduction of rates for the benchmarked services performed after the implementation of those pricing adjustments which could harm the financial performance of our services business 

some it service agreements require significant investment in the early stages that is expected to be recovered through billings over the life of the agreement these agreements often involve the construction of new it systems and communications networks and the development and deployment of new technologies substantial performance risk exists in each agreement with these characteristics and some or all elements of service delivery under these agreements are dependent upon successful completion of the development construction and deployment phases failure to perform satisfactorily under these agreements may expose us to legal liability result in the loss of customers or harm our reputation which could harm the financial performance of our it services business 

performance under contracts including those on which we have partnered with third parties may be adversely affected if we or the third parties fail to deliver on commitments or otherwise breach obligations to our customers 

our contracts are complex and in some instances may require that we partner with other parties including software and hardware vendors to provide the complex solutions required by our customers our ability to deliver the solutions and provide the services required by our customers is dependent on our and our partners ability to meet our customers delivery schedules if we or our partners fail to deliver services or products on time our ability to complete the contract may be adversely affected additionally our customers may perform audits or require us to perform audits and provide audit reports with respect to the controls and procedures that we use in the performance of services for such customers our ability to acquire new customers and retain existing customers may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed if we receive a qualified opinion or if we cannot obtain an unqualified opinion in a timely manner with respect to our controls and procedures in connection with any such audit we could also incur liability if our controls and procedures or the controls and procedures we manage for a customer were to result in an internal control failure or impair our customer’s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements if we or our partners fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise breach obligations to our customers we could be subject to legal liability which may have a material and adverse impact on our revenues and profitability 

our ability to provide customers with competitive services is dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 

our ability to grow and provide our customers with competitive services is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly motivated people with the skills necessary to serve our customers the markets we serve are highly competitive and competition for skilled employees in the technology outsourcing consulting and systems integration and enterprise services markets is intense for both onshore and offshore locales the loss of personnel could impair our ability to perform under certain contracts which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

additionally the inability to adequately develop and train personnel and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could have a material adverse effect on relationships with third parties our financial condition and results of operations and cash flows 

we also must manage leadership development and succession planning throughout our business any significant leadership change and accompanying senior management transition involves inherent risk and any failure to ensure a smooth transition could hinder our strategic planning execution and future performance while we strive to mitigate the negative impact associated with changes to our senior management team such changes may cause uncertainty among investors employees customers creditors and others concerning our future direction and performance if we fail to effectively manage our leadership changes including ongoing organizational and strategic changes our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and reputation as well as our ability to successfully attract motivate and retain key employees could be harmed 

in addition uncertainty around future employment opportunities facility locations organizational and reporting structures and other related concerns may impair our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel if employee attrition is high it may adversely impact our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our strategic priorities 

if we do not hire train motivate and effectively utilize employees with the right mix of skills and experience in the right geographic regions and for the right offerings to meet the needs of our customers our financial performance and cash flows could suffer for example if our employee utilization rate is too low our profitability and the level of engagement of our employees could decrease if that utilization rate is too high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition and the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects if we are unable to hire and retain enough employees with the skills or backgrounds needed to meet current demand we may need to redeploy existing personnel increase our reliance on subcontractors or increase employee compensation levels all of which could also negatively affect our profitability in addition if we have more employees than necessary with certain skill sets or in certain geographies we may incur increased costs as we work to rebalance our supply of skills and resources with customer demand in those geographies 

our international operations are exposed to risks including fluctuations in exchange rates which may be beyond our control 

our exposure to currencies other than the us dollar may impact our results as they are expressed in us dollars currency variations also contribute to variations in sales of products and services in affected jurisdictions for example in the event that one or more european countries were to replace the euro with another currency sales in that country or in europe generally may be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established while historically we have partially mitigated currency risk including exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates by matching costs with revenues in a given currency our exposure to fluctuations in other currencies against the us dollar increases as revenue in currencies other than the us dollar increases and as more of the services we provide are shifted to lower cost regions of the world approximately 66 of revenues earned during fiscal 2021 were derived from sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and are expected to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues also we believe that our ability to match revenues and expenses in a given currency will decrease as more work is performed at offshore locations 

we may use forward and option contracts to protect against currency exchange rate risks the effectiveness of these hedges will depend on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which may be particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand and highly volatile exchange rates we may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and currency variations in addition certain or all of our hedging activities may be ineffective may expire and not be renewed or may not offset the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations losses associated with hedging activities may also impact our revenues and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial condition 

the uk withdrew from the european union on january 31 2020 “brexit” in connection with brexit the uk and the european union agreed on the trade and cooperation agreement “tca” that governs the future trading relationship between the uk and the european union in specified areas the tca took effect on january 1 2021 the uk is no longer in the european union customs union and is outside of the european union single market the tca addresses trade economic arrangements law enforcement judicial cooperation and a governance framework including procedures for dispute resolution among other things because the agreement merely sets forth a framework in many respects and will require complex additional bilateral negotiations between the uk and the european union as both parties continue to work on the rules for implementation significant political and economic uncertainty remains about whether the terms of the relationship will differ materially from the terms before withdrawal uncertainty surrounding the effect of brexit as well as any potential impact on tax laws and trade policy in the us and elsewhere may adversely impact our operations 

our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors including 

• ongoing instability or changes in a country’s or region’s economic or geopolitical and security conditions including inflation recession interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflict civil unrest crime political instability human rights concerns and terrorist activity 

• natural or manmade disasters industrial accidents public health issues cybersecurity incidents interruptions of service from utilities transportation or telecommunications providers or other catastrophic events 

• longer collection cycles and financial instability among customers 

• trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production pricing and marketing of products including policies adopted by countries that may champion or otherwise favor domestic companies and technologies over foreign competitors 

• local labor conditions and regulations 

• managing our geographically dispersed workforce 

• changes in the international national or local regulatory and legal environments 

• differing technology standards or customer requirements 

• difficulties associated with repatriating earnings generated or held abroad in a taxefficient manner and 

• changes in tax laws 

our business operations are subject to various and changing federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we operate in approximately 70 countries in an increasingly complex regulatory environment among other things we provide complex industry specific insurance processing in the uk which is regulated by authorities in the uk and elsewhere such as the uk’s financial conduct authority and her majesty’s treasury and the us department of treasury which increases our exposure to compliance risk for example in february 2017 csc submitted an initial notification of voluntary disclosure to the us department of treasurys office of foreign assets control “ofac” regarding certain possible violations of us sanctions laws pertaining to insurance premium data and claims data processed by two partiallyowned joint ventures of xchanging which csc acquired during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 a copy of the disclosure was also provided to her majesty’s treasury office of financial sanctions implementation in the uk our related internal investigation is substantially complete and we provided supplemental information to ofac on january 31 2020 and continue to work with ofac on these issues our retail investment account management business in germany is another example of a regulated business which must maintain a banking license is regulated by the german federal financial supervisory authority and the european central bank and must comply with german banking laws and regulations 

in addition businesses in the countries in which we operate are subject to local legal and political environments and regulations including with respect to employment tax statutory supervision and reporting and trade restriction along with industry regulations such as regulation by bank regulators in the us and europe these regulations and environments are also subject to change 

adjusting business operations to changing environments and regulations may be costly and could potentially render the particular business operations uneconomical which may adversely affect our profitability or lead to a change in the business operations notwithstanding our best efforts we may not be in compliance with all regulations in the countries in which we operate at all times and may be subject to sanctions penalties or fines as a result these sanctions penalties or fines may materially and adversely impact our profitability 

our operations are also subject to a broad array of domestic and international environmental health and safety laws and regulations including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites environmental costs and accruals are presently not material to our operations cash flows or financial position and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities however our failure to comply with these laws or regulations can result in civil criminal or regulatory penalties fines and legal liabilities suspension delay or alterations of our operations damage to our reputation and restrictions on our operations or sales our business could also be affected if new environmental legislation is passed which impacts our current operations and business in addition as climate change laws regulations treaties and national and global initiatives are adopted and implemented regionally or throughout the world we may be required to comply or potentially face market access limitations fines or reputational injury such laws regulations treaties or initiatives in response to climate change could result in increased operational costs associated with air pollution requirements and increased compliance and energy costs which could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our business operations 

we are also subject to risks associated with environmental social and governance “esg” regulations governmental bodies investors clients and businesses are increasingly focused on prioritizing esg practices which has resulted and may in the future continue to result in the adoption of new laws and regulations our inability to keep pace with any esg regulations trends and developments or failure to meet the expectations or interests of our clients and investors could adversely affect our business and reputation 

we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plans and our restructuring may adversely affect our business 

we have implemented several restructuring plans to realign our cost structure due to the changing nature of our business and to achieve operating efficiencies to reduce our costs we may not be able to obtain the costs savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring plans additionally as a result of our restructuring we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge andor inefficiency during transitional periods reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees time and focus which may divert attention from operating and growing our business there are also significant costs associated with restructuring which can have a significant impact on our earnings and cash flow if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for more information about our restructuring plans see note 22  restructuring costs 

in the course of providing services to customers we may inadvertently infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and be exposed to claims for damages 

the solutions we provide to our customers may inadvertently infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties resulting in claims for damages against us or our customers our contracts generally indemnify our customers from claims for intellectual property infringement for the services and equipment we provide under the applicable contracts we also indemnify certain vendors and customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use by such vendors and customers of software products and services and certain other matters some of the applicable indemnification arrangements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses the expense and time of defending against these claims may have a material and adverse impact on our profitability if we lose our ability to continue using any such services and solutions because they are found to infringe the rights of others we will need to obtain substitute solutions or seek alternative means of obtaining the technology necessary to continue to provide such services and solutions our inability to replace such solutions or to replace such solutions in a timely or costeffective manner could materially adversely affect our results of operations additionally the publicity resulting from infringing intellectual property rights may damage our reputation and adversely impact our ability to develop new business 

our inability to procure thirdparty licenses required for the operation of our products and service offerings may result in decreased revenue or increased costs 

many of our products and service offerings depends on the continued performance and availability of software licensed from thirdparty vendors under our contractual arrangements because of the nature of these licenses and arrangements there can be no assurance that we would be able to retain all of these intellectual property rights upon renewal expiration or termination of such licenses or that we will be able to procure renew or extend such licenses on commercially reasonable terms which may result in increased costs certain of our licenses are concentrated in one or more thirdparty licensors where multiple licenses are up for renewal at the same time which could decrease our ability to negotiate reasonable license fees and could result in our loss of rights under such licenses 

we may be exposed to negative publicity and other potential risks if we are unable to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the related regulations require our management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud however a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met there can be no assurance that all control issues or fraud will be detected as we continue to grow our business our internal controls continue to become more complex and require more resources 

any failure to maintain effective controls could prevent us from timely and reliably reporting financial results and may harm our operating results in addition if we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of each fiscal year end we may be exposed to negative publicity which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information any failure to maintain effective internal controls and any such resulting negative publicity may negatively affect our business and stock price 

additionally the existence of any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies would require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a timely manner the existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations subject us to litigation or regulatory scrutiny and cause stockholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information all of which could materially and adversely affect us and the market price of our common stock 

we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting without effective internal control over financial reporting we may fail to detect or prevent a material misstatement in our financial statements which could materially harm our business our reputation and our stock price 

  

during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 our management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2019 related to reassessing policies and procedures to determine their continued relevance as impacted by complex transactions and processes see item 9a controls and procedures without effective internal control over financial reporting we may fail to detect or prevent a material misstatement in our financial statements in that event we may be required to restate our financial statements a restatement or an unremediated material weakness could result in a loss of confidence in us by our investors customers regulators andor counterparties in addition our remediation efforts are still ongoing and if we are unable to promptly remediate the material weakness identified above or if we were to conclude in the future that we have one or more additional weaknesses our investors regulators customers andor counterparties may lose confidence in our reported financial information additionally management may be required to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate the material weakness and management may not be able to complete such remediation in a timely manner any of the foregoing could materially harm our business our reputation and the market price of our common stock 

we could suffer additional losses due to asset impairment charges 

we acquired substantial goodwill and other intangibles as a result of the hpes merger and the luxoft acquisition increasing our exposure to this risk we test our goodwill for impairment during the second quarter of every year and on an interim date should events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount if the fair value of a reporting unit is revised downward due to declines in business performance or other factors or if the company suffers further declines in share price an impairment could result and a noncash charge could be required we test intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable this assessment of the recoverability of finitelived intangible assets could result in an impairment and a noncash charge could be required we also test certain equipment and deferred cost balances associated with contracts when the contract is materially underperforming or is expected to materially underperform in the future as compared to the original bid model or budget if the projected cash flows of a particular contract are not adequate to recover the unamortized cost balance of the asset group the balance is adjusted in the tested period based on the contracts fair value either of these impairments could materially affect our reported net earnings 

we may not be able to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock in accordance with our announced intent or at all 

on april 3 2017 we announced the establishment of a share repurchase plan approved by the board of directors with an initial authorization of up to 20 billion for future repurchases of outstanding shares of our common stock on november 8 2018 dxc announced that its board of directors approved an incremental 20 billion share repurchase authorization in addition while we paid quarterly cash dividends to our stockholders starting fiscal 2018 in accordance with our announced dividend policy we suspended the payment of quarterly dividends starting in fiscal 2021 to enhance our financial flexibility we intend to continue to suspend quarterly cash dividends for fiscal 2022 the declaration and payment of future dividends the amount of any such dividends and the establishment of record and payment dates for dividends if any are subject to final determination by our board of directors after review of our current strategy and financial performance and position among other things 

the board of directors’ determinations regarding dividends and share repurchases will depend on a variety of factors including net income cash flow generated from operations amount and location of our cash and investment balances overall liquidity position and potential alternative uses of cash such as acquisitions as well as economic conditions and expected future financial results there can be no guarantee that we will achieve our financial goals in the amounts or within the expected time frame or at all our ability to declare future dividends will depend on our future financial performance which in turn depends on the successful implementation of our strategy and on financial competitive regulatory and other factors general economic conditions demand and prices for our services and other factors specific to our industry or specific projects many of which are beyond our control therefore our ability to generate cash flow depends on the performance of our operations and could be limited by decreases in our profitability or increases in costs regulatory changes capital expenditures or debt servicing requirements 

any failure to achieve our financial goals could negatively impact our reputation harm investor confidence in us and cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

we are defendants in pending litigation that may have a material and adverse impact on our profitability and liquidity 

as noted in note 23  commitments and contingencies we are currently party to a number of disputes that involve or may involve litigation or arbitration including putative securities class actions pending in both state and federal courts and other lawsuits in which we and certain of our officers and directors have been named as defendants the result of these lawsuits and any other future legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of their subject matter or merits such legal proceedings may result in significant cost to us including in the form of legal fees andor damages which may not be covered by insurance may divert the attention of management or may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations negative publicity from litigation whether or not resulting in a substantial cost could materially damage our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and the price of our common stock in addition such legal proceedings may make it more difficult to finance our operations 

we are also subject to continuous examinations of our income tax returns by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final results of any tax examination or related litigation could be materially different from our related historical income tax provisions and accruals adverse developments in an audit examination or litigation related to previously filed tax returns or in the relevant jurisdiction’s tax laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations could have a material effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods for more detail see note 13 – “income taxes” 

we may be adversely affected by disruptions in the credit markets including disruptions that reduce our customers access to credit and increase the costs to our customers of obtaining credit 

the credit markets have historically been volatile and therefore it is not possible to predict the ability of our customers to access shortterm financing and other forms of capital if a disruption in the credit markets were to occur it could pose a risk to our business if customers or suppliers are unable to obtain financing to meet payment or delivery obligations to us in the event that one or more customers or suppliers defaults on its payment or delivery obligations we could incur significant losses which may harm our business reputation results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition customers may decide to downsize defer or cancel contracts which could negatively affect our revenues 

further as of march 31 2021 we have 07 billion of floating interest rate debt accordingly a spike in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

our hedging program is subject to counterparty default risk 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps with a number of counterparties as a result we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these contracts defaults on its performance under the contract during an economic downturn the counterpartys financial condition may deteriorate rapidly and with little notice and we may be unable to take action to protect our exposure in the event of a counterparty default we could incur significant losses which may harm our business and financial condition in the event that one or more of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy our ability to eventually recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterpartys default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty 

we derive significant revenues and profit from contracts awarded through competitive bidding processes which can impose substantial costs on us and we may not achieve revenue and profit objectives if we fail to bid on these projects effectively 

we derive significant revenues and profit from government contracts that are awarded through competitive bidding processes we expect that most of the nonus government business we seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through competitive bidding competitive bidding is expensive and presents a number of risks including 

• the substantial cost and managerial time and effort that we spend to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may or may not be awarded to us 

• the need to estimate accurately the resources and costs that will be required to service any contracts we are awarded sometimes in advance of the final determination of their full scope and design 

• the expense and delay that may arise if our competitors protest or challenge awards made to us pursuant to competitive bidding 

• the requirement to resubmit bids protested by our competitors and in the termination reduction or modification of the awarded contracts and 

• the opportunity cost of not bidding on and winning other contracts we might otherwise pursue 

if our customers experience financial difficulties we may not be able to collect our receivables which would materially and adversely affect our profitability and cash flows from operations 

over the course of a contract term a customers financial condition may decline and limit its ability to pay its obligations this could cause our cash collections to decrease and bad debt expense to increase while we may resort to alternative methods to pursue claims or collect receivables these methods are expensive and time consuming and successful collection is not guaranteed failure to collect our receivables or prevail on claims would have an adverse effect on our profitability and cash flows 

if we are unable to maintain and grow our customer relationships over time our operating results and cash flows will suffer failure to comply with customer contracts or government contracting regulations or requirements could adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows 

we devote significant resources to establish relationships with our customers and implement our offerings and related services particularly in the case of large enterprises that often request or require specific features or functions specific to their particular business profile accordingly our operating results depend in substantial part on our ability to deliver a successful customer experience and persuade customers to maintain and grow their relationship with us over time if we are not successful in implementing an offering or delivering a successful customer experience including achieving cost and staffing levels that meet our customers’ expectations customers could terminate or elect not to renew their agreements with us and our operating results may suffer 

contracts with customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements in particular our contracts with federal state provincial and local governmental customers are generally subject to various procurement regulations contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance including the maintenance of necessary security clearances contracts with us government agencies are also subject to audits and investigations which may include a review of performance on contracts pricing practices cost structure and compliance with applicable laws and regulations 

any failure on our part to comply with the specific provisions in customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations or other requirements could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments and in the case of government contracts fines and suspension from future government contracting such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business in addition we may be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to government contracts which could include claims for treble damages further any negative publicity with respect to customer contracts or any related proceedings regardless of accuracy may damage our business by harming our ability to compete for new contracts 

contracts with the us federal government and related agencies are also subject to issues with respect to federal budgetary and spending limits or matters any changes to the fiscal policies of the us federal government may decrease overall government funding result in delays in the procurement of products and services due to lack of funding cause the us federal government and government agencies to reduce their purchases under existing contracts or cause them to exercise their rights to terminate contracts at will or to abstain from exercising options to renew contracts any of which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows 

if our customer contracts are terminated if we are suspended or disbarred from government work or our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our financial performance could suffer 

recent us tax legislation may materially affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

recently enacted us tax legislation has significantly changed the us federal income taxation of us corporations including by reducing the us corporate income tax rate limiting interest deductions permitting immediate expensing of certain capital expenditures adopting elements of a territorial tax system imposing a onetime transition tax or “repatriation tax” on all undistributed earnings and profits of certain usowned foreign corporations revising the rules governing net operating losses and the rules governing foreign tax credits and introducing new antibase erosion provisions many of these changes were effective immediately without any transition periods or grandfathering for existing transactions the legislation is unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the us department of the treasury and internal revenue service irs any of which could lessen or increase certain impacts of the legislation in addition state and local jurisdictions continue to issue guidance on how these us federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities 

while our analysis and interpretation of this legislation is ongoing based on our current evaluation we recorded a provisional reduction of our deferred income tax liabilities resulting in a material noncash benefit to earnings during fiscal 2018 the period in which the tax legislation was enacted which was adjusted in fiscal 2019 

additionally the repatriation tax resulted in a material amount of additional us tax liability the majority of which was reflected as an income tax expense in fiscal 2018 when the tax legislation was enacted despite the fact that the resulting tax may be paid over eight years further there may be other material adverse effects resulting from future guidance including technical corrections 

in addition on march 27 2020 the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act “cares act” was enacted in respect to the recent outbreak of covid19 the cares act among other things includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits the ability to utilize and carryback certain net operating losses alternative minimum tax refunds and modifications to rules regarding the deductibility of net interest expense subsequent to the cares act additional stimulus legislation has been enacted which included additional individual and corporate tax provisions and modifications to the cares act 

while some of the changes made by recent tax legislation may be beneficial to the company in one or more reporting periods and prospectively other changes may be adverse on a going forward basis we continue to work with our tax advisors to determine the full impact that recent tax legislation as a whole will have on us 

changes in us tax legislation regulation and government policy as a result of the 2020 us presidential and congressional elections may impact our future financial position and results of operations 

on march 31 2021 president biden proposed the american jobs plan which included provisions to increase the corporate income tax rate to 28 create a new 15 minimum tax on “book income” and increased taxes on foreign income while the likelihood of these changes or others being enacted or implemented is unclear if passed in its current form the proposed legislation could have a negative impact on our future financial position to the extent that such changes have a negative impact on us our suppliers or our customers including as a result of related uncertainty these changes may materially and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

changes in tax rates could affect our future results 

our future effective tax rates which are largely driven by the mix of our global earnings and the differing statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions where we operate are subject to change as a result of changes in statutory tax rates enacted in those jurisdictions or by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

risks related to our strategic transactions 

we could have an indemnification obligation to hpe if the stock distribution in connection with the hpes business separation the distribution were determined not to qualify for taxfree treatment which could materially adversely affect our financial condition 

if due to any of our representations being untrue or our covenants being breached the distribution was determined not to qualify for taxfree treatment under section 355 of the internal revenue code the code hpe would generally be subject to tax as if it sold the dxc common stock in a taxable transaction which could result in a material tax liability in addition each hpe stockholder who received dxc common stock in the distribution would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the dxc common stock received by the stockholder in the distribution 

under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with hpe in connection with the hpes merger we were required to indemnify hpe against taxes resulting from the distribution or certain aspects of the hpes merger arising as a result of an everett tainting act as defined in the tax matters agreement if we were required to indemnify hpe for taxes resulting from an everett tainting act that indemnification obligation would likely be substantial and could materially adversely affect our financial condition 

if the hpes merger does not qualify as a reorganization under section 368a of the code cscs former stockholders may incur significant tax liabilities 

the completion of the hpes merger was conditioned upon the receipt by hpe and csc of opinions of counsel to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the hpes merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368a of the code the hpes merger tax opinions the parties did not seek a ruling from the irs regarding such qualification the hpes merger tax opinions were based on current law and relied upon various factual representations and assumptions as well as certain undertakings made by hpe hpes and csc if any of those representations or assumptions is untrue or incomplete in any material respect or any of those undertakings is not complied with or if the facts upon which the hpes merger tax opinions are based are materially different from the actual facts that existed at the time of the hpes merger the conclusions reached in the hpes merger tax opinions could be adversely affected and the hpes merger may not qualify for taxfree treatment opinions of counsel are not binding on the irs or the courts no assurance can be given that the irs will not challenge the conclusions set forth in the hpes merger tax opinions or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the hpes merger were determined to be taxable previous holders of csc common stock would be considered to have made a taxable disposition of their shares to hpes and such stockholders would generally recognize taxable gain or loss on their receipt of hpes common stock in the hpes merger 

we assumed certain material pension benefit obligations in connection with the hpes merger these liabilities and the related future funding obligations could restrict our cash available for operations capital expenditures and other requirements and may materially adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity 

pursuant to the employee matters agreement entered into in connection with the hpes merger while hpe retained all us defined benefit pension plan liabilities dxc retained all liabilities relating to the international retirement guarantee “irg” programs for all hpes employees the irg is a nonqualified retirement plan for employees who transfer internationally at the request of the hpe group the irg determines the country of guarantee which is generally the country in which an employee has spent the longest portion of his or her career with the hpe group and the present value of a full career benefit for the employee under the hpe defined benefit pension plan and social security or social insurance system in the country of guarantee the irg then offsets the present value of the retirement benefits from plans and social insurance systems in the countries in which the employee earned retirement benefits for his or her total period of hpe group employment the net benefit value is payable as a single sum as soon as practicable after termination or retirement this liability could restrict cash available for our operations capital expenditures and other requirements and may materially affect our financial condition and liquidity 

in addition pursuant to the employee matters agreement dxc assumed certain other defined benefit pension liabilities in a number of nonus countries including the uk germany and switzerland unless otherwise agreed or required by local law where a defined benefit pension plan was maintained solely by a member of the hpes business dxc assumed all assets and liabilities arising out of those nonus defined benefit pension plans and where a defined benefit pension plan was not maintained solely by a member of the hpes business dxc assumed all assets and liabilities for those eligible hpes employees in connection with the hpes merger these liabilities and the related future payment obligations could restrict cash available for our operations capital expenditures and other requirements and may materially affect our financial condition and liquidity 

the usps separation and mergers and nps separation could result in substantial tax liability to dxc and our stockholders 

among the closing conditions to completing the usps separation and mergers we received a legal opinion of tax counsel substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes i the usps separation qualifies as a “reorganization” within the meaning of section 368a1d of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” ii each of dxc and perspecta is a “party to a reorganization” within the meaning of section 368b of the code with respect to the usps separation iii the usps distribution qualifies as 1 a taxfree spinoff resulting in nonrecognition under sections 355a 361 and 368a of the code and 2 a transaction in which the stock distributed thereby should constitute “qualified property” for purposes of sections 355d 355e and 361c of the code and iv none of the related mergers causes section 355e of the code to apply to the usps distribution if notwithstanding the conclusions expressed in these opinions the usps separation and mergers were determined to be taxable dxc and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities 

in addition prior to the hpes merger csc spun off its north american public sector business nps on november 27 2015 the nps separation in connection with the nps separation csc received an opinion of counsel substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the nps separation qualified as a taxfree transaction to csc and holders of csc common stock under section 355 and related provisions of the code the completion of the hpes merger was conditioned upon the receipt of csc of an opinion of counsel to the effect that the hpes merger should not cause section 355e of the code to apply to the nps separation or otherwise affect the qualification of the nps separation as a taxfree distribution under section 355 of the code  if notwithstanding the conclusions expressed in these opinions the nps separation were determined to be taxable csc and csc stockholders that received csra inc csra stock in the nps separation could incur significant tax liabilities 

the opinions of counsel we received were based on among other things various factual representations and assumptions as well as certain undertakings made by dxc perspecta and csra if any of those representations or assumptions is untrue or incomplete in any material respect or any of those undertakings is not complied with the conclusions reached in the opinion could be adversely affected and the usps separation or the nps separation may not qualify for taxfree treatment furthermore an opinion of counsel is not binding on the irs or the courts accordingly no assurance can be given that the irs will not challenge the conclusions set forth in the opinions or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if notwithstanding our receipt of the opinions the usps separation or nps separation is determined to be taxable we would recognize taxable gain as if we had sold the shares of perspecta or csra in a taxable sale for its fair market value which could result in a substantial tax liability in addition if the usps separation or nps separation is determined to be taxable each holder of our common stock who received shares of perspecta or csra would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received which could materially increase such holder’s tax liability 

additionally even if the usps separation otherwise qualifies as a taxfree transaction the usps distribution could be taxable to us but not to our shareholders in certain circumstances if future significant acquisitions of our stock or the stock of perspecta are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the usps distribution in this event the resulting tax liability could be substantial in connection with the usps separation we entered into a tax matters agreement with perspecta under which it agreed not to undertake any transaction without our consent that could reasonably be expected to cause the usps separation to be taxable to us and to indemnify us for any tax liabilities resulting from such transactions these obligations and potential tax liabilities could be substantial

results of operations 

the following table sets forth certain financial data for fiscal 2021 and 2020 



fiscal 2021 highlights 

fiscal 2021 financial highlights include the following 

• fiscal 2021 revenues were 17729 million a decrease of 94 as compared to fiscal 2020 the decrease was primarily due to project terminations the disposition of the us state and local health and human services business hhs business at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2021 decrease in runrate project volume and project completions offset by contributions from our luxoft acquisition which was executed during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and additional services provided to new and existing customers refer to the section below captioned revenues 

• fiscal 2021 net loss and diluted loss per share were 146 million and 059 respectively net loss decreased by 5212 million during fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to goodwill impairment offset by a gain on arbitration recognized in the prior year with fiscal 2021 benefiting from a gain on disposition of the hhs business cost optimization realized in the current year and a reduction in revenue in the current year previously mentioned refer to the section below captioned cost and expenses net loss included the cumulative impact of certain items of 773 million during fiscal 2021 reflecting restructuring costs transaction separation and integrationrelated costs amortization of acquired intangible assets impairment losses gains on dispositions pension and other postretirement benefit opeb actuarial and settlement losses debt extinguishment costs and tax adjustment this compares with net loss and diluted loss per share of 5358 million and 2076 respectively for fiscal 2020 

• fiscal 2021 income tax expense increased significantly over fiscal 2020 as a result of the gain on disposition of the hhs business which included the impact of nontax deductible goodwill fiscal 2020 income tax expense also reflected the impact of nontax deductible goodwill impairments 

• our cash and cash equivalents were 2968 million at march 31 2021 

• we generated 124 million of cash from operations during fiscal 2021 as compared to 2350 million during fiscal 2020 

revenues 

during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 the distribution of our revenues across geographies was as follows 



the decrease in revenues for fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020 reflects project terminations the disposition of the hhs business at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2021 decrease in runrate project volume and project completions offset by contributions from our luxoft acquisition which was executed during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and additional services provided to new and existing customers fiscal 2021 revenues included a favorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 17 primarily driven by the weakening of the us dollar against the australian dollar euro and british pound 

for a discussion of risks associated with our foreign operations see part i item 1a risk factors of this annual report 

as a global company over 66 of our fiscal 2021 revenues were earned internationally as a result the comparison of revenues denominated in currencies other than the us dollar from period to period is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates constant currency revenues are a nongaap measure calculated by translating current period activity into us dollars using the comparable prior period’s currency conversion rates this information is consistent with how management views our revenues and evaluates our operating performance and trends the table below summarizes our constant currency revenues 



global business services 

our gbs revenues were 83 billion for fiscal 2021 a decrease of 85 compared to fiscal 2020 gbs revenue in constant currency decreased 101 compared to fiscal 2020 the decrease in gbs revenues was primarily due to the disposition of the hhs business at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2021 project completions and decrease in runrate project volume the decrease in revenue for fiscal 2021 was partially offset by contributions from our luxoft acquisition which was executed during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and additional services provided to existing customers 

global infrastructure services 

our gis revenues were 94 billion for fiscal 2021 a decrease of 103 compared to fiscal 2020 gis revenue in constant currency decreased 119 compared to fiscal 2020 the decrease in gis revenues reflects project completions terminations and decrease in runrate project volume the decrease in revenue for fiscal 2021 was partially offset by additional services provided to new and existing customers 

during fiscal 2021 gbs and gis had contract awards of 110 billion and 88 billion respectively compared with 90 billion and 87 billion respectively during fiscal 2020 

costs and expenses 

our total costs and expenses were as follows 



the 304 point decrease in total costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2021 primarily reflects gains net of losses on dispositions in the current year and our fiscal 2020 goodwill impairment losses partially offset by the gain on arbitration award that didn’t occur in fiscal 2021 

costs of services 

cost of services excluding depreciation and amortization and restructuring costs cos was 141 billion for fiscal 2021 as compared to 149 billion in fiscal 2020 cos decreased 08 billion compared to the prior fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to cost optimization savings partially offset by 190 million in impairments realized during fiscal 2021 the majority of impairments were on assets prepurchased through preferred vendor agreements which are scheduled to expire in fiscal 2022 the remainder of impairments primarily relate to software cos as a percentage of revenue increased 35 as compared to the prior fiscal year the increase was driven by a decline in revenue exceeding associated cost reductions that were further impacted by asset impairment during the current fiscal year 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expense excluding depreciation and amortization and restructuring costs sga was 21 billion for fiscal 2021 consistent with fiscal 2020 sga as a percentage of revenue increased 12 compared to fiscal 2020 the increase was driven by a reduction in revenue during the current fiscal year 

transaction separation and integrationrelated costs included in sga were 358 million during fiscal 2021 as compared to 318 million during fiscal 2020 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation expense was 754 million for fiscal 2021 as compared to 643 million in fiscal 2020 depreciation expense increased 111 million due to an increase in newly capitalized assets and assets placed into service 

amortization expense was 1216 million for fiscal 2021 as compared to 1299 million in fiscal 2020 amortization expense decreased 83 million primarily due to a decrease in customer related intangibles related to the disposition of the hhs business at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2021 see note 3  divestitures for additional information 

goodwill impairment losses 

dxc recognized goodwill impairment charges totaling 6794 million during fiscal 2020 the impairment charges were primarily the result of a sustained decline in market capitalization during the fiscal 2020 see note 12  goodwill for additional information 

restructuring costs 

restructuring costs represent severance related to workforce optimization programs and expense associated with facilities and data center rationalization 

during fiscal 2021 management approved global cost savings initiatives designed to better align our workforce and facility structures total restructuring costs recorded net of reversals during fiscal 2021 and 2020 were 551 million and 252 million respectively the net amounts recorded included 13 million and 10 million of pension benefit augmentations for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively owed to certain employees under legal or contractual obligations these augmentations will be paid as part of normal pension distributions over several years 

see note 22  restructuring costs for additional information about our restructuring actions 

interest expense and interest income 

interest expense for fiscal 2021 was 361 million as compared to 383 million in fiscal 2020 the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower interest rates on finance leases a reduction in interest charges within our multicurrency cash pools and retirement of debt instruments the decrease in interest expense for fiscal 2021 was partially offset by increased amounts drawn on our revolving credit facility 

interest income for fiscal 2021 was 98 million as compared to 165 million in fiscal 2020 the yearoveryear decrease in interest income was primarily driven by interest income in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 related to arbitration discussed below under the caption “gain on arbitration award and lower income from our multicurrency cash pools and money market accounts 

debt extinguishment costs 

during fiscal 2021 we recorded 41 million of debt extinguishment costs within the consolidated statement of operations which consists primarily of costs related to the redemption of 400 senior notes due fiscal 2024 there were no debt extinguishment costs recorded in fiscal 2020 

gain on dispositions 

during fiscal 2021 dxc sold its hhs business for 50 billion which resulted in an estimated pretax gain on sale of 2014 million net of closing costs insignificant businesses were also sold during fiscal 2021 that resulted in a loss of 10 million 

gain on arbitration award 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 dxc received final arbitration award proceeds of 666 million related to the hpe enterprise services merger completed in fiscal 2018 the arbitration award included 632 million in damages that were recorded as a gain the remaining 34 million of the award related to preaward interest dispute details are subject to confidentiality obligations 

other expense income net 

other expense income net comprises nonservice cost components of net periodic pension income movement in foreign currency exchange rates on our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and the related economic hedges equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and other miscellaneous gains and losses 

the components of other expense income net for fiscal 2021 and 2020 are as follows 



the 822 million decrease in other income for fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year was due to a yearoveryear decrease of 768 million in nonservice components of net periodic pension income attributable to changes in marktomarket actuarial assumptions and asset valuations a yearoveryear unfavorable foreign currency impact of 39 million and a 15 million decrease in other gains related to sales of nonoperating assets 

taxes 

our effective tax rate etr on income loss from continuing operations before taxes for fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 was 1223 25 and 19 respectively a reconciliation of the differences between the us federal statutory rate and the etr as well as other information about our income tax provision is provided in note 13  income taxes 

in fiscal 2021 the etr was primarily impacted by 

• impact of the hhs and other business divestitures which increased tax expense and increased the etr 344 million and 526 respectively the hhs tax gain increased tax expense and the etr as the tax basis of assets sold primarily goodwill was lower than the book basis 

• continued losses in countries where we are recording a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets primarily in belgium denmark italy france luxembourg and us and an impairment of the full german deferred tax asset which increased income tax expense and increased the etr by 1565 million and 2393 respectively 

• an increase in income tax and foreign tax credits which decreased income tax expense and decreased the etr by 319 million and 487 respectively 

• local losses on investments in luxembourg that increased the foreign rate differential and decreased the etr by 1226 million and 1875 respectively with an offsetting increase in the etr due to an increase in the valuation allowance of the same amount 

• the company recognized adjustments to uncertain tax positions that increased the overall income tax expense and the etr by 112 million and 172 respectively 

in fiscal 2020 the etr was primarily impacted by 

• nondeductible goodwill impairment charge which increased income tax expense and increased the etr by 1482 million and 283 respectively 

• nontaxable gain on the arbitration award which decreased income tax expense and decreased the etr by 186 million and 36 respectively 

• a change in the net valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets primarily in australia brazil china luxembourg and singapore which increased income tax expense and increased the etr by 631 million and 121 respectively 

• an increase in income tax and foreign tax credits primarily relating to research and development credits recognized for prior years which decreased income tax expense and decreased the etr by 135 million and 26 respectively 

• local losses on investments in luxembourg that increased the foreign rate differential and decreased the etr by 637 million and 122 respectively with an offsetting increase in the etr due to an increase in the valuation allowance of the same amount 

in fiscal 2019 the etr was primarily impacted by 

• local tax losses on investments in luxembourg that decreased the foreign tax rate differential and decreased the etr by 360 million and 237 respectively with an offsetting increase in the etr due to an increase in the valuation allowance of the same amount 

• a change in the net valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets primarily in luxembourg germany spain uk and switzerland which increased income tax expense and increased the etr by 256 million and 169 respectively 

• a decrease in the transition tax liability and a change in tax accounting method for deferred revenue which decreased income tax expense and decreased the etr by 66 million and 43 respectively 

the irs is examining the companys federal income tax returns for fiscal 2008 through the tax year ended october 31 2018 with respect to cscs fiscal 2008 through 2017 federal tax returns the company has entered into negotiations for a resolution on the years under audit through settlement with the irs office of appeals the irs examined several issues for these years that resulted in various audit adjustments the company and the irs office of appeals have an agreement in principle as to some of these adjustments and we disagree with the irs’ disallowance of certain losses and deductions resulting from restructuring costs and tax planning strategies in previous years as we believe we will ultimately prevail on the technical merits of the disagreed items and intend to challenge them in the irs office of appeals or tax court these matters are not fully reserved and would result in a federal and state tax expense of 405 million including estimated interest and penalties and related cash cost for the unreserved portion of the these items if we do not prevail in tax court we do not expect these matters that proceed to tax court to be resolved in the next 12 months we have received a notice of deficiency with respect to fiscal 2011 and 2013 and have filed a petition in tax court with respect to fiscal 2013 and expect to file in tax court with respect to fiscal 2011 in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 we also expect fiscal 2010 to proceed to tax court 

the company has agreed to extend the statute of limitations for fiscal years 2008 through 2012 through august 31 2021 to provide for irs completion of their review the company has agreed to extend the statute of limitations for fiscal years 2014 through fiscal 2017 through october 31 2021 to provide for irs completion of their review 

the company expects to reach a resolution for all years no earlier than the first quarter of fiscal 2023 except for agreed issues related to fiscal 2008 through 2010 and fiscal 2011 through 2017 federal tax returns which are expected to be resolved within twelve months 

in addition the company may settle certain other tax examinations have lapses in statutes of limitations or voluntarily settle income tax positions in negotiated settlements for different amounts than we have accrued as uncertain tax positions the company may need to accrue and ultimately pay additional amounts for tax positions that previously met a more likely than not standard if such positions are not upheld conversely the company could settle positions by payment with the tax authorities for amounts lower than those that have been accrued or extinguish a position through less payment than previously estimated we believe the outcomes that are reasonably possible within the next twelve months may result in a reduction in liability for uncertain tax positions of 52 million excluding interest penalties and tax carryforwards 

loss per share 

diluted loss per share for fiscal 2021 was 059 as compared to 2076 in fiscal 2020 the loss per share decrease was due to a decrease of 5212 million in net loss 

diluted loss per share for fiscal 2021 includes 179 per share of restructuring costs 106 per share of transaction separation and integrationrelated costs 159 per share of amortization of acquired intangible assets 055 per share of impairment losses 422 per share of net gains on dispositions 157 per share of pension and opeb actuarial and settlement losses 012 per share of debt extinguishment costs and 055 per share of tax adjustment relating to a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets offset by changes in outside basis related to held for sale classification of the hps business 

nongaap financial measures 

we present nongaap financial measures of performance which are derived from the statements of operations of dxc these nongaap financial measures include earnings before interest and taxes ebit adjusted ebit nongaap income from continuing operations before income taxes nongaap net income and nongaap eps constant currency revenues net debt and net debttototal capitalization 

we believe ebit adjusted ebit nongaap income before income taxes nongaap net income and nongaap eps provide investors with useful supplemental information about our operating performance after excluding certain categories of expenses 

we believe constant currency revenues provides investors with useful supplemental information about our revenues after excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations for currencies other than us dollars in the periods presented see below for a description of the methodology we use to present constant currency revenues we believe net debt and net debttototal capitalization provide investors with useful supplemental information about dxc’s net leverage and capitalization 

one category of expenses excluded from adjusted ebit nongaap income from continuing operations before tax nongaap net income and nongaap eps incremental amortization of intangible assets acquired through business combinations may result in a significant difference in period over period amortization expense on a gaap basis we exclude amortization of certain acquired intangible assets as these noncash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing andor size of acquisitions although dxc management excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets primarily customerrelated intangible assets from its nongaap expenses we believe that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and support revenue generation any future transactions may result in a change to the acquired intangible asset balances and associated amortization expense 

another category of expenses excluded from adjusted ebit nongaap income from continuing operations before tax nongaap net income and nongaap eps impairment losses may result in a significant difference in period over period expense on a gaap basis we exclude impairment losses as these noncash amounts generally an acceleration of what would be multiple periods of expense and do not expect to occur frequently further assets such as goodwill may be significantly impacted by market conditions outside of management’s control 

there are limitations to the use of the nongaap financial measures presented in this report one of the limitations is that they do not reflect complete financial results we compensate for this limitation by providing a reconciliation between our nongaap financial measures and the respective most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap additionally other companies including companies in our industry may calculate nongaap financial measures differently than we do limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes between companies 

selected references are made on a “constant currency basis” so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates thereby providing comparisons of operating performance from period to period financial results on a “constant currency basis” are nongaap measures calculated by translating current period activity into us dollars using the comparable prior period’s currency conversion rates this approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the us dollar please see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations—fiscal 2021 highlights” 

certain nongaap financial measures and the respective most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap include

liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents and cash flows 

as of march 31 2021 our cash and cash equivalents cash was 30 billion of which 13 billion was held outside of the us we maintain various multicurrency multientity crossborder physical and notional cash and pool arrangements with various counterparties to manage liquidity efficiently that enable participating subsidiaries to draw on the company’s pooled resources to meet liquidity needs 

a significant portion of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is not expected to be impacted by us federal income tax upon repatriation however a portion of this cash may still be subject to foreign and us state income tax consequences upon future remittance therefore if additional funds held outside the us are needed for our operations in the us we plan to repatriate these funds not designated as indefinitely reinvested 

we have 02 billion in cash held by foreign subsidiaries used for local operations that is subject to countryspecific limitations which may restrict or result in increased costs in the repatriation of these funds in addition other practical considerations may limit our use of consolidated cash this includes cash of 06 billion held in a german financial services subsidiary subject to regulatory requirements and 01 billion held by majority owned consolidated subsidiaries where thirdparties or public shareholders hold minority interests 

cash was 30 billion and 37 billion as of march 31 2021 and march 31 2020 respectively the following table summarizes our cash flow activity 



operating cash flow 

net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2021 was 124 million as compared to 2350 million during fiscal 2020 the decrease of 2226 million was due to a decrease in net income net of adjustments of 2923 million the net decrease in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by a 697 million favorable change in working capital due to lower working capital outflows during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 

the following table contains certain key working capital metrics 



investing cash flow 

net cash provided by used in investing activities during fiscal 2021 was 4665 million as compared to 2137 million during fiscal 2020 the increase of 6802 million was primarily due to cash proceeds received from business divestitures of 4947 million in fiscal 2021 a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of 2181 million an increase in proceeds from sale of assets of 91 million a decrease in purchases of property and equipment of 89 million and the absence of shortterm investing net of proceeds of 37 million in fiscal 2020 this was partially offset by a decrease in cash collections related to deferred purchase price receivable of 512 million and a 48 million increase in payments for software licenses related to the divestitures of the hhs business 

financing cash flow 

net cash used in provided by financing activities during fiscal 2021 was 5476 million as compared to 657 million during fiscal 2020 the 6133 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in repayments net of borrowings of 3718 million on term loans and other longterm debt 3000 million on lines of credit and 229 million on commercial paper in total we used 35 billion of the net proceeds from the sale of the hhs business to repay debt during the fiscal year we also had an increase in payments on finance leases and borrowings for asset financing of 65 million and payments of debt extinguishment costs of 41 million in fiscal 2021 this was partially offset by elimination of stock repurchases during fiscal 2021 while common stock repurchases totaled 736 million in fiscal 2020 and a decrease in dividend payments of 161 million from fiscal 2020 

capital resources 

see note 23  commitments and contingencies for a discussion of the general purpose of guarantees and commitments the anticipated sources of funds to fulfill such commitments are listed below and under the subheading liquidity 

the following table summarizes our total debt 



the 44 billion decrease in total debt during fiscal 2021 was primarily attributed to the prepayment of 15 billion of revolver credit facility outstanding at fiscal yearend march 31 2020 €312 million of euro commercial paper and the following term loan facilities €750 million of euro term loan due fiscal 2022 and 2023 a800 million of aud term loan due fiscal 2022 £450 million of gbp term loan due fiscal 2022 481 million of usd term loan due fiscal 2025 €350 million of euro term loan due fiscal 2024 and the retirement of 127 million principal amount of 445 senior notes due fiscal 2023 via tender offer see note 14  debt — tender offers in addition we issued irrevocable redemption notice to retire all the remaining two series of 445 senior notes approximately 319 million due fiscal 2023 these were partially offset by the issuance of 500 million of 413 senior notes due fiscal 2026 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 we applied for and were confirmed eligible to participate in the bank of england’s “boe” covid corporate funding facility a boe program that provides term liquidity funding to investment grade corporate issuers with significant operations in the uk in order to stabilize and facilitate continued access to sterling commercial paper markets at our option we can borrow up to a maximum of €10 billion or its equivalent in euro british pound and us dollar on june 15 2020 dxc capital funding dac previously named dxc capital funding limited an indirect subsidiary of the company issued £600 million in commercial paper maturing may 2021 under its existing €10 billion commercial paper program via direct sale to the boe the issued £600 million in commercial paper was subsequently prepaid as discussed below 

in october 2020 we sold the hhs business and used approximately 35 billion of the proceeds to prepay 1250 million of revolver credit facility £600 million of gbp commercial paper approximately 772 million €350 million of euro term loan due fiscal 2024 approximately 410 million 381 million of usd term loan due fiscal 2025 a500 million of aud term loan due fiscal 2022 approximately 358 million and €250 million of euro term loan due fiscal 2022 and 2023 approximately 292 million 

during fiscal 2021 we borrowed the remaining 25 billion under the 40 billion credit facility agreement and repaid the full 40 billion on the same the purpose of the borrowing was to mitigate our reliance on volatile shortterm commercial paper markets and to strengthen our cash and liquidity position given the uncertainties related to the covid19 crisis and its potential impact on our customers and our business the credit facility repayment resulted from the availability of other liquidity resources the entire 40 billion credit facility is available for redraw at our request 

in march 2021 we used cash on hand and redeemed the entire issue of 500 million of 400 senior notes due fiscal 2024 in anticipation of divestiture proceeds from the sale of our hps business that was completed on april 1 2021 we also commenced in march 2021 a concurrent tender offer and issued irrevocable redemption notice that resulted in the retirement of 127 million principal amount 445 notes due fiscal 2023 

subsequent to the fiscal year we used the proceeds from the sale of our hps business to complete the retirement of all remaining 319 million of the two series of 445 senior notes due fiscal 2023 we also repurchased 33 million of the 4125 senior notes due fiscal 2026 and took measures to retire and prepay certain capital leases and equipment related financing whose balance was about 300 million as of fiscal 2021 using the proceeds from the divestitures of other businesses and existing cash on hand 

we were in compliance with all financial covenants associated with our borrowings as of march 31 2021 and march 31 2020 

the debt maturity chart below summarizes the future maturities of longterm debt principal for fiscal years subsequent to march 31 2021 and excludes maturities of borrowings for assets acquired under longterm financing and finance lease liabilities the chart does not reflect the redemption of the remaining 319 million in notes due fiscal 2023 that were initiated via redemption notice in march 2021 which was completely retired in april 2021 see note 14  debt for more information 

the following table summarizes our capitalization ratios 



  

1 cash and cash equivalents includes previously described cash held outside of the us at a german financial services subsidiary and at majority owned consolidated subsidiaries 

2 net debt and net debttototal capitalization are nongaap measures used by management to assess our ability to service our debts using our cash and cash equivalents including cash subject to limitations as previously described in cash and cash equivalents and cash flows we present these nongaap measures to assist investors in analyzing our capital structure in a more comprehensive way compared to gross debt based ratios alone 

net debttototal capitalization as of march 31 2021 decreased as compared to march 31 2020 primarily due to the decrease in total debt attributed to the prepayment of the credit facility agreement and various term loans bonds and commercial papers during the fiscal year as mentioned above and by the increase in equity primarily attributed to the gain on disposition of businesses during fiscal 2021 

as of march 31 2021 our credit ratings were as follows 



for information on the risk s of ratings downgrades see item 1a  risk factors subsection titled our credit rating and ability to manage working capital refinance and raise additional capital for future needs could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing cost and access to capital markets 

see note 23  commitments and contingencies for a discussion of the general purpose of guarantees and commitments the anticipated sources of funds to fulfill such commitments are listed below 

liquidity 

we expect our existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our normal operating requirements for the next 12 months we expect to continue using cash generated by operations as a primary source of liquidity however should we require funds greater than that generated from our operations to fund discretionary investment activities such as business acquisitions we have the ability to raise capital through debt financing including the issuance of capital market debt instruments such as commercial paper and bonds in addition we currently utilize and will further utilize our crosscurrency cash pool for liquidity needs however there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain debt financing if required on terms and conditions acceptable to us if at all in the future 

our exposure to operational liquidity risk is primarily from longterm contracts which require significant investment of cash during the initial phases of the contracts the recovery of these investments is over the life of the contract and is dependent upon our performance as well as customer acceptance 

the following table summarizes our total liquidity 



during march 2020 as the evolving global covid19 crisis resulted in increasing government actions to shut down economic activity and enforce stayathome orders global capital markets were disrupted and became tumultuous including the near shut down of commercial paper markets for issuers such as the company as shortterm fixed income investors prepared for potential redemptions on march 24 2020 the company announced the drawdown of 15 billion from its revolving credit f acility due 2025 in order to increase cash on hand and eliminate the reliance on commercial paper markets along with the suspension of the company’s euro and usd commercial paper program until the company deems such capital markets stabilized and reliable as a result the company’s commercial paper outstanding was reduced from 863 million to 542 million as of march 31 2020 and further reduced to 213 million as of march 31 2021 during fiscal 2021 capital markets have stabilized and central bank actions have improved liquidity in commercial paper markets and our access to such commercial paper markets have normalized 

on april 6 2020 the company drew the entire 25 billion remaining availability under its revolving credit facilities in order to secure liquidity as additional cash on hand to support the company’s liquidity resources during the covid19 crisis and to mitigate the uncertainties caused by volatile capital markets changing governmental policies and evolving impact on world economies 

in may 2020 the company issued 10 billion in principal amount of senior notes in the form of 500 million principal amount of 400 senior notes due fiscal 2024 and 500 million principal amount of 413 senior notes due fiscal 2026 all the net proceeds from the notes offerings were applied towards the early prepayment of the company’s term loan facilities including prepayment of €500 million of euro term loan due fiscal 2022 £150 million of gbp term loan due fiscal 2022 a300 million of aud term loan due fiscal 2022 and 100 million of usd term loan due fiscal 2025 

in march 2021 the company retired 500 million principal amount of 40 senior notes due fiscal 2024 

the company retired via tender offer 127 million principal amount of its 445 senior notes due fiscal 2023 across two series in march 2021 and issued irrevocable redemption notice for the remaining amounts outstanding in april 2021 the company retired the remaining 319 million principal amount across two series through redemption there is no amount outstanding under either series of the 445 notes due fiscal 2023 after the completion of these two actions 

on may 15 2020 the company agreed with its lenders and modified the definition of leverage ratio to be measured on a “net of cash” basis across all of the company’s bank credit and term loan facilities and for such newly defined leverage ratio limitation of total consolidated net indebtedness to adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization as defined in such credit and term loan facilities currently at 30x to be reduced to 225x thereafter beginning the fiscal year ending march 31 2022 with the first quarterly measurement date as of june 30 2021 the net effect of such adjustment to the leverage ratio definition in the company’s credit and term loan facilities is to allow the company the flexibility to maintain elevated cash balances going forward both during current circumstances and thereafter without constraining the company’s strategy of maintaining strong access to liquidity during the covid crisis the company’s credit and term loan facilities that were modified include 40 billion revolving credit facilities due fiscal year 2025 €250 million euro term loan due fiscal year 2022 a substantial portion was extended to mature in fiscal year 2023 pursuant to the euro term loan extension see below €750 million euro term loan due fiscal year 2023 a substantial portion was extended to mature in fiscal year 2024 pursuant to the euro term loan extension see below £300 million in gbp term loan due fiscal year 2022 a500 million in aud term loan due fiscal year 2022 and approximately 382 million in outstanding usd term loan due fiscal year 2025 as of fiscal 2021 only 40 billion revolving credit facilities due fiscal year 2026 including a 390 million subtranche due fiscal 2025 and €400 million euro term loan due fiscal year 2024 including a small €27 million subtranche due fiscal 2023 remain outstanding and are subject to such amended leverage ratio limitations in the company’s credit and term loan facilities 

on may 15 2020 the company initiated elective extension amendments in accordance with the terms of the aggregate €10 billion principal amount of euro term loans outstanding accordingly €2167 million out of €250 million euro term loan due fiscal year 2022 agreed to extend maturity 12months to mature fiscal year 2023 and €700 million out of total €750 million euro term loan due fiscal year 2023 agreed to extend maturity 12months to mature fiscal year 2024 margin would increase during the 12month extension terms to euribor  125bps and euribor  175bps respectively for the euro term loans originally due fiscal years 2022 and 2023 which would be an increase from the current applicable margin of euribor  65bps and euribor  80 bps respectively there is no change to current margin or terms through the original maturity term of the euro term loans 

share repurchases 

during fiscal 2018 our board of dire ctors authorized the repurchase of up to 20 billion of our common stock and during fiscal 2019 our board of directors had approved an incremental 20 billion share repurchase this program became effective on april 3 2017 with no end date established there were no share repurchases during fiscal 2021 see note 16  stockholders equity for more information 

dividends 

to maintain our financial flexibility we continue to suspend payment of quarterly dividends for fiscal 2022 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business we are a party to arrangements that include guarantees the receivables securitization facility and certain other financial instruments with offbalance sheet risk such as letters of credit and surety bonds we also use performance letters of credit to support various risk management insurance policies no liabilities related to these arrangements are reflected in balance sheets see note 6  receivables and note 23  commitments and contingencies for additional information regarding these offbalance sheet arrangements 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of march 31 2021 were as follows 



  

1 amounts represent scheduled principal payments of longterm debt and mandatory redemption of preferred stock of a consolidated subsidiary 

2 amounts represent present value of operating leases including imputed interests see note 7   leases  for more information 

3 includes longterm purchase agreements with certain software hardware telecommunication and other service providers and exclude agreements that are cancellable without penalty if we do not meet the specified service minimums we may have an obligation to pay the service provider a portion of or the entire shortfall see note 23  commitments and contingencies for more information 

4 the transition tax resulted in recording a total transition tax obligation of 237 million of which 243 million was recorded as income tax liability and 6 million recorded as a reduction in our unrecognized tax benefits which has been omitted from this table the transition tax is payable over eight years 8 of net tax liability in each of years 15 15 in year 6 20 in year 7 and 25 in year 8 we have made our first three payments 

5 amounts represent scheduled interest payments on longterm debt and scheduled dividend payments associated with the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of a consolidated subsidiary excluding contingent dividends associated with the participation and variable appreciation premium features 

6 see note 13  income taxes for additional information about the estimated liability related to unrecognized tax benefits which has been omitted from this table see note 15  pension and other benefit plans for the estimated liability related to estimated future benefit payments under our pension and opeb plans that have been omitted from this table 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities these estimates may change in the future if underlying assumptions or factors change accordingly actual results could differ materially from our estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions we consider the following policies to be critical because of their complexity and the high degree of judgment involved in implementing them revenue recognition income taxes business combinations defined benefit plans and valuation of assets we have discussed the selection of our critical accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 

revenue recognition 

most of our revenues are recognized based on objective criteria and do not require significant estimates that may change over time however some arrangements may require significant estimates including contracts which include multiple performance obligations  

contracts with multiple performance obligations 

many of our contracts re quire us to provide a range of services or performance obligations to our customers which may include a combination of services products or both and may also contain leases embedded in those arrangements as a result significant judgment may be required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the elements specified in contracts with multiple performance obligations should be treated as separate performance obligations for revenue recognition purposes and when considered appropriate how the total transaction price should be allocated among the performance obligations and any lease components and the timing of revenue recognition for each for contracts with multiple performance obligations and lease components we allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation and lease component based on the relative standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract other than software sales involving multiple performance obligations the primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin approach under which we forecast our expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that distinct good or service certain of our contracts involve the sale of dxc proprietary software post contract customer support and other softwarerelated services the standalone selling price generally is determined for each performance obligation using an adjusted market assessment approach based on the price charged where each deliverable is sold separately in certain limited cases typically for software licenses when the historical selling price is highly variable the residual approach is used this approach allocates revenue to the performance obligation equal to the difference between the total transaction price and the observable standalone selling prices for the other performance obligations these methods involve significant judgments and estimates that we assess periodically by considering market and entityspecific factors such as type of customer features of the products or services and market conditions 

once the total revenues have been allocated to the various performance obligations and lease components revenues for each are recognized based on the relevant revenue recognition method for each estimates of total revenues at contract inception often differ materially from actual revenues due to volume differences changes in technology or other factors which may not be foreseen at inception 

contract modifications 

a contract modification is a legally binding change to the scope price or both of an existing contract contract modifications are reviewed to determine whether they should be accounted for as part of the original contract the termination of an existing contract and the creation of a new contract or as a separate contract and whether they modify an embedded lease this determination requires significant judgment which could impact the timing of revenue recognition 

costs to obtain contracts with customers 

accounting for the costs to obtain contracts with customers requires significant judgments and estimates with regards to the determination of sales commission payments that qualify for deferral of costs and the related amortization period most of our sales commission plans are quotabased and payments are made by achieving targets related to a large number of new and renewed contracts certain sales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer we defer and amortize these costs on a straightline basis over an average period of benefit of five years which is determined and regularly assessed by considering the length of our customer contracts our technology and other factors significant changes in these estimates or impairment may result if material contracts terminate earlier than the expected benefit period or if there are material changes in the average contract period 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes analyzing our income tax reserves the determination of the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets and any corresponding adjustment of valuation allowances in addition our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions 

as a global enterprise our etr is affected by many factors including our global mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates the extent to which our nonus earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the us changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets changes in tax regulations acquisitions dispositions and the tax characteristics of our income we cannot predict what our etr will be in the future because there is uncertainty regarding these factors 

with the following exceptions the majority of our global unremitted foreign earnings have been taxed or would be exempt from tax upon repatriation except for the following earnings which are considered indefinitely reinvested approximately 522 million that could be taxable when repatriated to the us under section 1245a5b of the final treasury regulations issued during fiscal 2021 and our accumulated earnings in india a portion of these indefinitely reinvested earnings may be subject to foreign and us state tax consequences when remitted the company will continue to evaluate its position in the future based on its future strategy and cash needs 

considerations impacting the recoverability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates in determining whether the deferred tax assets are realizable we consider all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences taxable income in prior carryback years projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations we recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of approximately 39 billion as of march 31 2021 due to uncertainties related to the ability to utilize these assets however valuation allowances are subject to change in future reporting periods due to changes in various factors 

we determine whether it is more likely than not a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit is recorded in our financial statements a tax position is measured as the portion of the tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information we may be required to change our provision for income taxes when the ultimate treatment of certain items is challenged or agreed to by taxing authorities when estimates used in determining valuation allowances on deferred tax assets significantly change or when receipt of new information indicates the need for adjustment in valuation allowances future events such as changes in tax laws tax regulations or interpretations of such laws or regulations could have an impact on the provision for income tax and the effective tax rate any such changes could significantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements in the year these changes occur 

recent enactment of the tax laws or changes in tax laws resulting from the organization for economic cooperation and development’s multijurisdictional plan of action to address “base erosion and profit shifting” could impact our effective tax rate the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex changing tax regulations 

the india finance bill 2021 was enacted on march 28 2021 after receiving approval of both houses of parliament and assent of the president of india the key provision of this bill disallows depreciation on goodwill in case of mergerdemergerslump sale but permits a deduction for the amount paid for acquired goodwill at time of sale the disallowance of tax depreciation on goodwill has been factored in the calculation of our tax liabilities 

the uk finance bill 2021 “finance bill” which will become finance act 2021 after royal assent was published in march 2021 the finance bill included increases in the corporation tax and diverted profits tax rates from april 1 2023 the new temporary 130 super deduction first year capital allowances and the temporary extension to the carryback of trading losses as the detail of the legislation has yet to be finalized or enacted it is difficult at this stage to determine the impact of the finance bill on our future financial results in the uk 

business combinations 

we account for the acquisition of a business using the acquisition method of accounting which requires us to estimate the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed this includes acquired intangible assets such as customerrelated intangibles the liabilities assumed and contingent consideration if any liabilities assumed may include litigation and other contingency reserves existing at the time of acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining the related fair values independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities such appraisals are based on significant estimates provided by us such as forecasted revenues or profits utilized in determining the fair value of contractrelated acquired intangible assets or liabilities significant changes in assumptions and estimates subsequent to completing the allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired as well as differences in actual and estimated results could result in material impacts to our financial results adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in earnings additional information related to the acquisition date fair value of acquired assets and liabilities obtained during the allocation period not to exceed one year may result in changes to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the business acquired 

defined benefit plans 

the computation of our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations is dependent on various assumptions inherent in the application of the actuarial methods are key assumptions including discount rates expected longterm rates of return on plan assets mortality rates rates of compensation increases and medical cost trend rates our management evaluates these assumptions annually and updates assumptions as necessary the fair value of assets is determined based on observable inputs for similar assets or on significant unobservable inputs if not available two of the most significant assumptions are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate 

our weighted average rates used were 



the assumption for the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is impacted by the expected asset mix of the plan judgments regarding the correlation between historical excess returns and future excess returns and expected investment expenses the discount rate assumption is based on current market rates for highquality fixed income debt instruments with maturities similar to the expected duration of the benefit payment period the following table provides the impact changes in the weightedaverage assumptions would have had on our net periodic pension benefits and settlement and contractual termination charges for fiscal 2021 



valuation of assets 

we review longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill for impairment in accordance with our accounting policy disclosed in note 1  summary of significant accounting policies assessing the fair value of assets involves significant estimates and assumptions including estimation of future cash flows the timing of such cash flows and discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in projecting future cash flows the valuation of longlived and intangible assets involves management estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of assets particularly purchased intangible assets these estimates are subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and forecasts 

evaluation of goodwill for impairment requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the identification of reporting units involves consideration of components of the operating segments and whether or not there is discrete financial information available that is regularly reviewed by management additionally we consider whether or not it is reasonable to aggregate any of the identified components that have similar economic characteristics the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors changes in these estimates and assumptions include a significant change in the business climate established business plans operating performance indicators or competition which could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach using performancemetric market multiples the discount rate used in an income approach is based on our weightedaverage cost of capital and may be adjusted for the relevant risks associated with businessspecific characteristics and any uncertainty related to a reporting units ability to execute on the projected future cash flows 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as a multinational company we are exposed to certain market risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates changes in foreign currency exchange rates can impact our foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions in foreign currency whereas changes in benchmark interest rates can impact interest expense associated with our floating interest rate debt and the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks including operating and financing activities and the use of derivative instruments we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

presented below is a description of our risks together with a sensitivity analysis of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates the foreign currency model incorporates the impact of diversification from holding multiple currencies and the correlation of revenues costs and any related shortterm contract financing in the same currency in order to determine the impact of changes in interest rates on our future results of operations and cash flows we calculated the increase or decrease in the index underlying these rates we estimate the fair value of our longterm debt primarily using an expected present value technique using interest rates offered to us for instruments with similar terms and remaining maturities these analyses reflect managements view of changes that are reasonably possible to occur over a oneyear period 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to both favorable and unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates in the ordinary course of business we enter into contracts denominated in foreign currencies exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising from these contracts is analyzed during the contract bidding process we generally manage these contracts by incurring costs in the same currency in which revenues are received and any related shortterm contract financing requirements are met by borrowing in the same currency thus by generally matching revenues costs and borrowings to the same currency we are able to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency risk to earnings however due to our increased use of offshore labor centers we have become more exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we experienced signifi cant foreign currency fluctuations during fiscal 2021 due primarily to the volatility of the australian dollar euro and british pound in relation to the us dollar significant foreign currency fluctuations during fiscal 2020 was due primarily to the volatility of the australian dollar british pound and euro in relation to the us dollar 

we have policies and procedures to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency by using shortterm foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities including intercompany accounts and loans for accounting purposes these foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedges and changes in their fair value a re reported in current period earnings within other expense income net in the statements of operations we also use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risk related to certain indian rupee denominated intercompany obligations and forecasted transactions for accounting purposes these foreign currency forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges with critical terms that match the hedged items therefore the changes in fair value of these forward contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income net of taxes in the statements of comprehensive income and subsequently classified into net income in the period the hedged transactions are recognized in net income 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than us dollar see note 21  revenue during fiscal 2021 over 66 of our revenues were generated outside of the united states for the year ended march 31 2021 a hypothetical 10 change in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would have changed revenues by approximately 66 or 12 billion the majority of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency and as a result there would not be a material change to our income from continuing operations before taxes as such in the view of management the resulting impact would not be material to our results of operations or cash flows 

interest rate risk 

as of march 31 2021 we had outstanding debt with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of 55 billion of which 07 billion was floating interest rate debt most of our floating interest rate debt is based upon varying terms of adjusted libor rates consequently changes in libor result in the most volatility to our interest expense as of march 31 2021 an assumed 10 unfavorable change in interest rates would not be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flows a change in interest rates related to our longterm debt would not have a material impact on our financial statements as we do not record our debt at fair value

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

our management under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended as of the end of the period covered by this report to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the sec reports i is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the secs rules and forms and ii is accumulated and communicated to our management including the principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

based on this evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that dxcs disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of march 31 2021 because of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as described below and previously disclosed in our december 31 2019 form 10q and subsequent form 10k and 10q filings in managements report on internal control over financial reporting notwithstanding this material weakness described below management has concluded that the companys consolidated financial statements for the periods covered by and included in this annual report on form 10k are fairly stated in all material respects in accordance with gaap for each of the periods presented herein 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 

management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria and framework established in internal control  integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of march 31 2021 because of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below 

a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that a reasonable possibility exists that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statement would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

as previously disclosed in item 4 “controls and procedures” of our form 10q for the period ended december 31 2019 management concluded there was a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting relating to the design and implementation of effective control activities based on the criteria established in the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal control – integrated framework 2013 management identified multiple deficiencies that constitute a material weakness in the aggregate related to the establishment and timely reassessment of policies and procedures for complex transactions and processes and the related impacts to control activities 

as a result we have concluded that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to our consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis and therefore we concluded that the aggregation of these deficiencies represents a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of march 31 2021 

remediation plan 

management has taken and will continue to take significant and comprehensive actions to remediate the material weakness with the addition of new operations and finance leadership working in concert with the audit committee management assessed the root cause of the multiple deficiencies that aggregated to the material weakness as a result an extension of time is necessary to make further control enhancements to deliver a sustainable control environment and remediate the material weakness 

the audit committee has been fully engaged and supportive of management’s efforts to remediate the material weakness beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 the audit committee has received a remediation report at each regularly held meeting and had additional informal meetings specifically to review progress on the remediation participants have included the chief executive officer chief financial officer controller sox leader and internal audit to answer questions and take feedback from the committee additionally the audit committee requested that the new finance leadership complete a detailed review of the root cause analysis and remediation plan which was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 making it necessary for an extension of time to complete additional remediation actions including further augmenting the companys talent 

the following activities are designed as part of this remediation plan to 1 address the material weakness in the control activities component of the coso framework and 2 enhance and improve our control activities and processes 

actions to remediate the material weakness in the control activities component of coso 

• we appointed a new chief financial officer during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 with previous experience as a chief accounting officer and substantial experience leading a finance organization through transformation including remediating material weaknesses our chief financial officer is leading our remediation efforts and is focused on driving change in our finance organization control environment and culture 

• we evaluated our finance organization and have and will augment our finance team with additional professionals with the appropriate levels of accounting controls finance oversight and tax experience and training 

• we hired a dedicated team of controls and process experts to standardize our processes and focus our key controls to address material risks 

• we are increasing communication and training to employees regarding internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures 

• we are designing and implementing an enterprise wide process to timely identify track and appropriately resolve and conclude on complex transactions and disclosures 

additional enhancements to improve our control activities and processes 

• we are enhancing our financial cadence and discipline including reviewing the underlying performance of the business and related balance sheet accounts 

• we are enhancing key enterprise controls including financial operations reviews working capital reviews balance sheet reviews and assessment and monitoring of nonroutine accounting transactions 

• we are assessing relevant policies focusing on ownership and accountability and reviewing and implementing changes to thresholds to focus on risk 

• we are refining the financial close process so it executes with the appropriate cadence and rigor to reduce the length of time it takes to close 

• we are standardizing processes rationalizing and strengthening controls to mitigate significant risk enhance control owner accountability and transparency to address deficiencies in a holistic and timely manner 

these additional remediation efforts identified to comprehensively address our analysis of root causes have begun and are expected to be completed in subsequent quarters after management’s remediation efforts are complete subsequent testing will be required to conclude that a material weakness no longer exists our goal is to have enhanced control policies procedures processes in place as promptly as practicable however we are not in a position to complete our remediation plan and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is not designed or operating effectively as of march 31 2021 

the effectiveness of dxcs internal control over financial reporting as of march 31 2021 has been audited by deloitte  touche llp an independent registered public accounting firm which is contained in this annual report 

changes in internal controls over financial reporting 

in addition to the remediation efforts described above we adopted asc 326 “financial instruments  credit losses topic 326 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments” effective april 1 2020 as described in note 2  “recent accounting pronouncements” to the financial statements during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 we began using a new model and redesigned certain processes and controls relating to our reserves and expected losses 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended march 31 2021 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

competition 

the it and professional services markets in which we compete are highly competitive and are not dominated by a single company or a small number of companies a substantial number of companies offer services that overlap and are competitive with those we offer in addition the increased importance of offshore labor centers has brought several foreignbased firms into competition with us 

our competitors include 

 

the principal methods of competition in the markets for our solutions and services include 

 

our ability to obtain new business and retain existing business is dependent upon the following 

 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of trade secrets patents copyrights and trademarks as well as contractual protections to protect our business interests while our technical services and products are not generally dependent upon patent protection we do selectively seek patent protection for certain inventions likely to be incorporated into products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position 

as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms of the individual patents across the patent portfolio vary we believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our solutions and services and enhancing our freedom of action to sell solutions and services in markets in which we choose to participate no single patent is in itself essential to our company as a whole or to any business segment 

additionally we own or have rights to various trademarks logos service marks and trade names that are used in the operation of our business we also own or have the rights to copyrights that protect the content of our products and other proprietary materials 

in addition to developing our intellectual property portfolio we license intellectual property rights from third parties as we deem appropriate we have also granted and plan to continue to grant licenses to others under our intellectual property rights when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest these license arrangements include a number of crosslicenses with third parties 

environmental regulation 

our operations are subject to regulation under various federal state local and foreign laws concerning the environment including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites environmental costs and accruals are presently not material to our operations cash flows or financial position and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities however we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and thirdparty damage or personal injury claims if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if new environmental legislation is passed which impacts our business

risk factors 

tableend 

any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this annual report in such case the trading price for dxc common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment the risks described below are not the only risks that dxc currently faces additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently expected to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations or the price of our common stock in the future past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

risks relating to our business 

we may not succeed in our strategic objectives which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we recently announced a number of senior leadership changes as well as updates to our strategic priorities including an initiative to assist dxc customers across a broader range of their information technology needs which we refer to as “the enterprise technology stack” we may not be able to implement our strategic priorities in accordance with our expectations for a variety of reasons including failure to execute on our plans in a timely fashion lack of adequate skills ineffective management inadequate incentives customer resistance to new initiatives inability to control costs or maintain competitive offerings we also cannot be certain that executing on our strategy will generate the benefits we expect if we fail to execute successfully on our strategic priorities or if we pursue strategic priorities that prove to be unsuccessful our business financial position results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected 

strategic alternatives we are considering may not achieve the results we expect could result in operating difficulties harm to one or more of our businesses and negative impacts our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we recently announced our intention to explore strategic alternatives for our us state and local health and human services business our horizontal bps business and our workplace  mobility business among the alternatives we may consider for those businesses are potential divestiture transactions any such transactions may involve significant challenges and risks including 



at any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more strategic alternatives and any of these strategic alternatives could be material to our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition we may explore a divestiture or spinoff or other transaction involving one or more of these businesses and ultimately determine not to proceed with any transaction or other strategic alternative for commercial financial strategic or other reasons as a result we may not realize benefits expected from exploring one or more strategic alternatives or may realize benefits further in the future and those benefits may ultimately be significantly smaller than anticipated which could adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

we expect our business and financial results to potentially be negatively impacted by the recent covid19 outbreak as well as other recent developments 

the recent outbreak of covid19 and global pandemic along with other recent developments including disruptions in global economies financial and commodities markets and rapid shifts in governmental and public health policies in response to these and other factors affecting the countries where we operate or our customers are located or the industries in which we and our customers compete are expected to potentially have a negative effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition these effects could include disruptions or restrictions on our employees’ ability to work effectively as well as temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our clients or our subcontractors or the requirements to deliver our services by working remotely this could potentially affect our ability to perform under our contracts with customers cost increases may not be recoverable from customers or covered by insurance which could impact our profitability if a business interruption occurs and we are unsuccessful in our continuing efforts to minimize the impact of these events our business results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected in addition the outbreak of covid19 has resulted in a widespread global pandemic health crisis that is adversely affecting the economies and financial markets of many countries which could result in an economic downturn that may negatively affect demand for our services including the financial failure of some of our clients this economic downturn depending upon its severity and duration could also lead to the deterioration of worldwide credit and financial markets that could limit our customers’ ability or willingness to pay us in a timely manner and our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures result in losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties and result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults our financial results may be materially and adversely impacted by a variety of factors that have not yet been determined including potential impairments of goodwill and other assets our evaluation of contingent liabilities for which actual amounts may materially exceed management estimates and our calculation of global tax liabilities even after the covid19 outbreak has subsided depending upon its duration and frequency of recurrence and the governmental policies in response thereto we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact including any recession that may occur or be continuing as a result we are evaluating the extent to which covid19 has impacted us and our employees customers and suppliers and the extent to which it and other emerging developments are expected to impact us in the future and caution investors that any of those factors could have material and adverse impacts on our current and future business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

to the extent the global covid19 pandemic and resulting economic disruption adversely affects our business and financial results it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “risk factors” section such as those relating to our level of indebtedness our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness and to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness and our counterparty credit risk 

we could be held liable for damages our reputation could suffer or we may experience service interruptions from security breaches cyberattacks or disclosure of confidential information or personal data which could cause significant financial loss 

as a provider of it services to private and public sector customers operating in a number of regulated industries and countries we store and process increasingly large amounts of data for our clients including sensitive and personally identifiable information we also manage it infrastructure of our own and of clients we possess valuable proprietary information including copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and we collect and store certain personal and financial information from customers and employees 

at the same time the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches and cyberattacks including by state actors reflects an external environment that is increasingly hostile to information and corporate security cybersecurity incidents can result from unintentional events or deliberate attacks by insiders or third parties including criminals competitors nationstates and hacktivists like other companies we face an evolving array of cybersecurity and data security threats that pose risks to us and our clients we can also be harmed by attacks on third parties such as denialofservice attacks we see regular unauthorized efforts to access our systems which we evaluate for severity and frequency while incidents experienced thus far have not resulted in significant disruption to our business it is possible that we could suffer a severe attack or incident with potentially material and adverse effects on our business reputation customer relations results of operations or financial condition 

we must expend capital and other resources to protect against attempted security breaches and cyberattacks and to alleviate problems caused by successful breaches or attacks we consider information security to be a top priority and are undertaking cybersecurity planning and activities throughout the company this includes the acquisition of technology and services review and refinement of cybersecurity and data security policies and procedures and employee training among many other investments senior management and the board of directors are appropriately and actively engaged in cybersecurity risk management 

our security measures are designed to identify and protect against security breaches and cyberattacks no threat incident identified to date has resulted in a material adverse effect on us or our customers however there is no perfect security system and our failure to detect prevent or adequately respond to a future threat incident could subject us to liability and reputational damage and have a material adverse effect on our business in addition the cost and operational consequences of responding to breaches and cyberattacks and implementing remediation measures could be significant 

  

we rely on internal and external information and technological systems to manage our operations and are exposed to risk of loss resulting from breaches in the security or other failures of these systems security breaches such as through an advanced persistent threat attack or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our clients or our customers could expose us to risk of loss of this information regulatory scrutiny actions and penalties extensive contractual liability and other litigation reputational harm and a loss of customer confidence which could potentially have an adverse impact on future business with current and potential customers 

advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments may result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms that we use to protect our data and that of clients including sensitive customer transaction data a party who is able to circumvent our security measures or those of our contractors partners or vendors could access our systems and misappropriate proprietary information the confidential data of our customers employees or business partners or cause interruption in our or their operations 

experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy ransomware malware and other malicious software programs through phishing and other methods that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of these products in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications produced or procured from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the security and operation of our systems or harm those of third parties with whom we may interact the costs to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems including ransomware malware bugs malicious software programs and other security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers which may impede our sales distribution or other critical functions 

increasing cybersecurity data privacy and information security obligations around the world could also impose additional regulatory pressures on our customers’ businesses and indirectly on our operations or lead to inquiries or enforcement actions in the united states we are seeing increasing obligations and expectations from federal and nonfederal customers in response some of our customers have sought and may continue to seek to contractually impose certain strict data privacy and information security obligations on us some of our customer contracts may not limit our liability for the loss of confidential information if we are unable to adequately address these concerns our business and results of operations could suffer 

compliance with new privacy and security laws requirements and regulations such as the european union general data protection regulation which became effective in may 2018 where required or undertaken by us may result in cost increases due to expanded compliance obligations potential systems changes the development of additional administrative processes and increased enforcement actions fines and penalties while we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations as well as internal privacy policies any failure or perceived failure to comply or any misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information may result in proceedings or actions against us by government or other entities private lawsuits against us including class actions or the loss of customers which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations 

portions of our infrastructure also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and be expensive timeconsuming disruptive and resource intensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could reduce our revenues increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

achieving our growth objectives may prove unsuccessful we may be unable to identify future attractive acquisitions and strategic partnerships which may adversely affect our growth in addition if we are unable to integrate acquisitions and implement strategic partnerships or achieve anticipated revenue improvements and cost reductions our profitability may be materially and adversely affected 

we may fail to complete strategic transactions closing strategic transactions is subject to uncertainties and risks including the risk that we will be unable to satisfy conditions to closing such as regulatory and financing conditions and the absence of material adverse changes to our business in addition our inability to successfully integrate the operations we acquire and leverage these operations to generate substantial cost savings as well as our inability to avoid revenue erosion and earnings decline could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial position in order to achieve successful acquisitions we will need to 

 

we may not be successful in meeting these challenges or any others encountered in connection with historical and future acquisitions in addition the anticipated benefits of one or more acquisitions may not be realized and future acquisitions could require dilutive issuances of equity securities andor the assumption of contingent liabilities the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have also entered into and intend to identify and enter into additional strategic partnerships with other industry participants that will allow us to expand our business however we may be unable to identify attractive strategic partnership candidates or complete these partnerships on terms favorable to us in addition if we are unable to successfully implement our partnership strategies or our strategic partners do not fulfill their obligations or otherwise prove disadvantageous to our business our investments in these partnerships and our anticipated business expansion could be adversely affected 

our ability to continue to develop and expand our service offerings to address emerging business demands and technological trends including the demand for digital technologies and services may impact our future growth if we are not successful in meeting these business challenges our results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected 

our ability to implement solutions for our customers incorporating new developments and improvements in technology that translate into productivity improvements for our customers and our ability to develop digital and other new service offerings that meet current and prospective customers needs as well as evolving industry standards are critical to our success the markets we serve are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change which has resulted in deflationary pressure in the price of services which in turn can adversely impact our margins our competitors may develop solutions or services that make our offerings obsolete or may force us to decrease prices on our services which can result in lower margins our ability to develop and implement up to date solutions utilizing new technologies that meet evolving customer needs in digital cloud information technology outsourcing consulting industry software and solutions application services markets  and in areas such as artificial intelligence automation internet of things and asaservice solutions 

in a timely or costeffective manner will impact our ability to retain and attract customers and our future revenue growth and earnings if we are unable to continue to develop digital and other new service offerings in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving environment or if we are unable to commercialize such services and solutions expand and scale them with sufficient speed and versatility our growth productivity objectives and profit margins could be negatively affected 

  

technological developments may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our customers some of these technologies have reduced and replaced some of our traditional services and solutions and may continue to do so in the future this has caused and may in the future cause customers to delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies such delays can negatively impact our results of operations if the pace and level of spending on new technologies is not sufficient to make up any shortfall  our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas if we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry developments or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation our services and solutions our results of operations and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be negatively affected 

our ability to compete in certain markets we serve is dependent on our ability to continue to expand our capacity in certain offshore locations however as our presence in these locations increases we are exposed to risks inherent to these locations which may adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

a significant portion of our application outsourcing and software development activities has been shifted to india and we plan to continue to expand our presence there and in other lowercost locations as a result we are exposed to the risks inherent in operating in india or other locations including 1 a highly competitive labor market for skilled workers which may result in significant increases in labor costs as well as shortages of qualified workers in the future and 2 the possibility that the us federal government or the european union may enact legislation that creates significant disincentives for customers to locate certain of their operations offshore which would reduce the demand for the services we provide in such locations and may adversely impact our cost structure and profitability in addition india has experienced and other countries may experience political instability civil unrest and hostilities with neighboring countries negative or uncertain political climates in countries or locations where we operate including but not limited to military activity or civil hostilities criminal activities and other acts of violence infrastructure disruption natural disasters or other conditions could adversely affect our operations 

we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended fcpa and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions we pursue opportunities in certain parts of the world that experience government corruption and in certain circumstances compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices our internal policies mandate compliance with all applicable antibribery laws we require our employees partners subcontractors agents and others to comply with the fcpa and other antibribery laws there is no assurance that our policies or procedures will protect us against liability under the fcpa or other laws for actions taken by our employees and intermediaries if we are found to be liable for fcpa violations either due to our own acts or our omissions or due to the acts or omissions of others we could suffer from severe criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations or cash flows in addition detecting investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of the fcpa or other antibribery violations is expensive and could consume significant time and attention of our senior management 

our credit rating and ability to manage working capital refinance and raise additional capital for future needs could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing cost and access to capital markets 

we currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with moodys investors service fitch rating services and standard  poors ratings services our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time rating agencies may review the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control including potential new standards requiring the agencies to reassess rating practices and methodologies ratings agencies may consider changes in credit ratings based on changes in expectations about future profitability and cash flows even if shortterm liquidity expectations are not negatively impacted if changes in our credit ratings were to occur it could result in higher interest costs under certain of our credit facilities it would also cause our future borrowing costs to increase and limit our access to capital markets for example we currently fund a portion of our working capital requirements in the us and european commercial paper markets any downgrade below our current rating would absent changes to current market liquidity substantially reduce or eliminate our ability to access that source of funding and could otherwise negatively impact the perception of our company by lenders and other third parties in addition certain of our major contracts provide customers with a right of termination in certain circumstances in the event of a rating downgrade below investment grade there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position and access to capital markets  

our liquidity is a function of our ability to successfully generate cash flows from a combination of efficient operations and continuing operating improvements access to capital markets and funding from third parties in addition like many multinational regulated enterprises our operations are subject to a variety of tax foreign exchange and regulatory capital requirements in different jurisdictions that have the effect of limiting delaying or increasing the cost of moving cash between jurisdictions or using our cash for certain purposes our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity going forward is subject to the general liquidity of and ongoing changes in the credit markets as well as general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other market factors that are beyond our control an increase in our borrowing costs limitations on our ability to access the global capital and credit markets or a reduction in our liquidity can adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

information regarding our credit ratings is included in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k under the caption liquidity and capital resources 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness totaling approximately 99 billion as of march 31 2020 including capital lease obligations we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future for many reasons including to fund acquisitions our existing indebtedness together with the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the restrictive covenants contained in or expected to be contained in the documents evidencing such indebtedness could have significant consequences on our future operations including 

 indebtedness that could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

 and limit the future availability for debt financing 

 

in addition we could be unable to refinance our outstanding indebtedness on reasonable terms or at all 

our ability to meet our payment and other obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future this to some extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that current or future borrowings will be sufficient to meet our current debt obligations and to fund other liquidity needs 

a substantial portion of our borrowing capacity bears interest at a variable rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor in july 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority “fca” which regulates libor announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 the us federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions is considering replacing libor with the secured overnight financing rate sofr a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities 

certain of our financing agreements include language to determine a replacement rate for libor if necessary however if libor ceases to exist we may need to renegotiate some financing agreements extending beyond 2021 that utilize libor as a factor in determining the interest rate we are evaluating the potential impact of the eventual replacement of the libor benchmark interest rate however we are not able to predict whether libor will cease to be available after 2021 whether sofr will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of libor or what the impact of such a possible transition to sofr may be on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our primary markets are highly competitive if we are unable to compete in these highly competitive markets our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

our competitors include large technically competent and well capitalized companies some of which have emerged as a result of industry consolidation as well as “pureplay” companies that have a single product focus this competition may place downward pressure on operating margins in our industry particularly for technology outsourcing contract extensions or renewals as a result we may not be able to maintain our current operating margins or achieve favorable operating margins for technology outsourcing contracts extended or renewed in the future if we fail to effectively reduce our cost structure during periods with declining margins our results of operations may be adversely affected 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors our competitiveness is based on factors including technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation range of products and services account relationships customer training service and support and security if we are unable to compete based on such factors our results of operations and business prospects could be harmed we have a large portfolio of services and we need to allocate financial personnel and other resources across all services while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of our service lines as a result we may invest less in certain business areas than our competitors do and competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available to them compared to the resources allocated to our services industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate additionally competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with existing or potential customers or suppliers 

companies with whom we have alliances in certain areas may be or become competitors in other areas in addition companies with whom we have alliances also may acquire or form alliances with competitors which could reduce their business with us if we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with alliance partners our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we face aggressive price competition and may have to lower prices to stay competitive while simultaneously seeking to maintain or improve revenue and gross margin in addition competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lowercost markets in which we compete or who can obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer our cash flows results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressures 

if we are unable to accurately estimate the cost of services and the timeline for completion of contracts the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected 

our commercial contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis our bids are based upon among other items the expected cost to provide the services we generally provide services under time and materials contracts unit price contracts fixedprice contracts and multipleelement software sales we are dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects and the marketplace and to generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services required by the contract and to complete the contracts in a timely manner we face a number of risks when pricing our contracts as many of our projects entail the coordination of operations and workforces in multiple locations and utilizing workforces with different skill sets and competencies across geographically diverse service locations in addition revenues from some of our contracts are recognized using the percentageofcompletion method which requires estimates of total costs at completion fees earned on the contract or both this estimation process particularly due to the technical nature of the services being performed and the longterm nature of certain contracts is complex and involves significant judgment adjustments to original estimates are often required as work progresses experience is gained and additional information becomes known even though the scope of the work required under the contract may not change if we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected 

some ito services agreements contain pricing provisions that permit a client to request a benchmark study by a mutually acceptable third party the benchmarking process typically compares the contractual price of services against the price of similar services offered by other specified providers in a peer comparison group subject to agreed­upon adjustment and normalization factors generally if the benchmarking study shows that the pricing differs from the peer group outside a specified range and the difference is not due to the unique requirements of the client then the parties will negotiate in good faith appropriate adjustments to the pricing this may result in the reduction of rates for the benchmarked services performed after the implementation of those pricing adjustments which could harm the financial performance of our services business 

some it service agreements require significant investment in the early stages that is expected to be recovered through billings over the life of the agreement these agreements often involve the construction of new it systems and communications networks and the development and deployment of new technologies substantial performance risk exists in each agreement with these characteristics and some or all elements of service delivery under these agreements are dependent upon successful completion of the development construction and deployment phases failure to perform satisfactorily under these agreements may expose us to legal liability result in the loss of customers or harm our reputation which could harm the financial performance of our it services business 

performance under contracts including those on which we have partnered with third parties may be adversely affected if we or the third parties fail to deliver on commitments or if we incur legal liability in connection with providing our services and solutions 

our contracts are complex and in some instances may require that we partner with other parties including software and hardware vendors to provide the complex solutions required by our customers our ability to deliver the solutions and provide the services required by our customers is dependent on our and our partners ability to meet our customers delivery schedules if we or our partners fail to deliver services or products on time our ability to complete the contract may be adversely affected additionally our customers may perform audits or require us to perform audits and provide audit reports with respect to the controls and procedures that we use in the performance of services for such customers our ability to acquire new customers and retain existing customers may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed if we receive a qualified opinion or if we cannot obtain an unqualified opinion in a timely manner with respect to our controls and procedures in connection with any such audit we could also incur liability if our controls and procedures or the controls and procedures we manage for a customer were to result in an internal control failure or impair our customer’s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements if we or our partners fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise breach obligations to our customers we could be subject to legal liability which may have a material and adverse impact on our revenues and profitability 

our ability to provide customers with competitive services is dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 

our ability to grow and provide our customers with competitive services is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly motivated people with the skills necessary to serve our customers the markets we serve are highly competitive and competition for skilled employees in the technology outsourcing consulting and systems integration and enterprise services markets is intense for both onshore and offshore locales the loss of personnel could impair our ability to perform under certain contracts which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

additionally the inability to adequately develop and train personnel and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could have a material adverse effect on relationships with third parties our financial condition and results of operations and cash flows 

we also must manage leadership development and succession planning throughout our business any significant leadership change and accompanying senior management transition such as our recent change in chief executive officer chief human resources officer and the hiring of new leaders in key roles involves inherent risk and any failure to ensure a smooth transition could hinder our strategic planning execution and future performance while we strive to mitigate the negative impact associated with changes to our senior management team such changes may cause uncertainty among investors employees customers creditors and others concerning our future direction and performance if we fail to effectively manage our leadership changes including ongoing organizational and strategic changes our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and reputation as well as our ability to successfully attract motivate and retain key employees could be harmed 

in addition uncertainty around future employment opportunities facility locations organizational and reporting structures and other related concerns may impair our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel if employee attrition is high it may adversely impact our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our strategic priorities 

if we do not hire train motivate and effectively utilize employees with the right mix of skills and experience in the right geographic regions and for the right offerings to meet the needs of our clients our financial performance and cash flows could suffer for example if our employee utilization rate is too low our profitability and the level of engagement of our employees could decrease if that utilization rate is too high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition and the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects if we are unable to hire and retain enough employees with the skills or backgrounds needed to meet current demand we may need to redeploy existing personnel increase our reliance on subcontractors or increase employee compensation levels all of which could also negatively affect our profitability in addition if we have more employees than necessary with certain skill sets or in certain geographies we may incur increased costs as we work to rebalance our supply of skills and resources with client demand in those geographies 

  

our international operations are exposed to risks including fluctuations in exchange rates which may be beyond our control 

our exposure to currencies other than the us dollar may impact our results as they are expressed in us dollars currency variations also contribute to variations in sales of products and services in affected jurisdictions for example in the event that one or more european countries were to replace the euro with another currency sales in that country or in europe generally may be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established while historically we have partially mitigated currency risk including exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates by matching costs with revenues in a given currency our exposure to fluctuations in other currencies against the us dollar increases as revenue in currencies other than the us dollar increases and as more of the services we provide are shifted to lower cost regions of the world approximately 63 of revenues earned during fiscal 2020 were derived from sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and are expected to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues also we believe that our ability to match revenues and expenses in a given currency will decrease as more work is performed at offshore locations 

we may use forward and option contracts to protect against currency exchange rate risks the effectiveness of these hedges will depend on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which may be particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand and highly volatile exchange rates we may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and currency variations in addition certain or all of our hedging activities may be ineffective may expire and not be renewed or may not offset the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations losses associated with hedging activities may also impact our revenues and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial condition 

uncertainty surrounding the effect of brexit including changes to the legal and regulatory framework that apply to the united kingdom and its relationship with the european union as well as new and proposed changes relating to brexit affecting tax laws and trade policy in the us and elsewhere may adversely impact our operations 

our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors including 

 

our business operations are subject to various and changing federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we operate in approximately 70 countries in an increasingly complex regulatory environment among other things we provide complex industry specific insurance processing in the united kingdom which is regulated by authorities in the united kingdom and elsewhere such as the uk’s financial conduct authority and her majesty’s treasury and the us department of treasury which increases our exposure to compliance risk for example in february 2017 csc submitted an initial notification of voluntary disclosure to the us department of treasurys office of foreign assets control “ofac” regarding certain possible violations of us sanctions laws pertaining to insurance premium data and claims data processed by two partiallyowned joint ventures of xchanging which csc acquired during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 a copy of the disclosure was also provided to her majesty’s treasury office of financial sanctions implementation in the united kingdom our related internal investigation is continuing and we have undertaken to cooperate with and provide a full report of our findings to ofac when completed our retail investment account management business in germany is another example of a regulated business which must maintain a banking license is regulated by the german federal financial supervisory authority and the european central bank and must comply with german banking laws and regulations 

in addition businesses in the countries in which we operate are subject to local legal and political environments and regulations including with respect to employment tax statutory supervision and reporting and trade restriction these regulations and environments are also subject to change 

adjusting business operations to changing environments and regulations may be costly and could potentially render the particular business operations uneconomical which may adversely affect our profitability or lead to a change in the business operations notwithstanding our best efforts we may not be in compliance with all regulations in the countries in which we operate at all times and may be subject to sanctions penalties or fines as a result these sanctions penalties or fines may materially and adversely impact our profitability 

we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plans and our restructuring may adversely affect our business 

our board of directors has approved several restructuring plans to realign our cost structure due to the changing nature of our business and to achieve operating efficiencies to reduce our costs we may not be able to obtain the costs savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring plans additionally as a result of our restructuring we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge andor inefficiency during transitional periods reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees time and focus which may divert attention from operating and growing our business if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for more information about our restructuring plans see note 21   restructuring costs  

in the course of providing services to customers we may inadvertently infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and be exposed to claims for damages 

the solutions we provide to our customers may inadvertently infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties resulting in claims for damages against us or our customers our contracts generally indemnify our clients from claims for intellectual property infringement for the services and equipment we provide under the applicable contracts we also indemnify certain vendors and customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use by such vendors and customers of software products and services and certain other matters some of the applicable indemnification arrangements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses the expense and time of defending against these claims may have a material and adverse impact on our profitability if we lose our ability to continue using any such services and solutions because they are found to infringe the rights of others we will need to obtain substitute solutions or seek alternative means of obtaining the technology necessary to continue to provide such services and solutions our inability to replace such solutions or to replace such solutions in a timely or costeffective manner could materially adversely affect our results of operations additionally the publicity resulting from infringing intellectual property rights may damage our reputation and adversely impact our ability to develop new business 

we may be exposed to negative publicity and other potential risks if we are unable to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the related regulations require our management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud however a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met there can be no assurance that all control issues or fraud will be detected as we continue to grow our business our internal controls continue to become more complex and require more resources 

  

any failure to maintain effective controls could prevent us from timely and reliably reporting financial results and may harm our operating results in addition if we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of each fiscal year end we may be exposed to negative publicity which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information any failure to maintain effective internal controls and any such resulting negative publicity may negatively affect our business and stock price 

additionally the existence of any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies would require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a timely manner the existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause stockholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information all of which could materially and adversely affect us and the market price of our common stock 

we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting without effective internal control over financial reporting we may fail to detect or prevent a material misstatement in our financial statements which could materially harm our business our reputation and our stock price 

  

while we have not identified any material misstatements in our previously reported consolidated financial statements our management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2019 see item 9a controls and procedures without effective internal control over financial reporting we may fail to detect or prevent a material misstatement in our financial statements in that event we may be required to restate our financial statements a restatement or an unremediated material weakness could result in a loss of confidence in us by our investors customers regulators andor counterparties in addition if we are unable to promptly remediate the material weakness identified above or if we were to conclude in the future that we have one or more additional weaknesses our investors regulators customers andor counterparties may lose confidence in our reported financial information additionally management may be required to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate the material weakness and management may not be able to complete such remediation in a timely manner any of the foregoing could materially harm our business our reputation and the market price of our common stock 

  

we could suffer additional losses due to asset impairment charges 

we acquired substantial goodwill and other intangibles as a result of the hpes merger and the luxoft acquisition increasing our exposure to this risk we test our goodwill for impairment during the second quarter of every year and on an interim date should events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount if the fair value of a reporting unit is revised downward due to declines in business performance or other factors or if the company suffers further declines in share price an impairment could result and a noncash charge could be required we test intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable this assessment of the recoverability of finitelived intangible assets could result in an impairment and a noncash charge could be required for example during fiscal 2020 we recorded noncash goodwill impairment charges of 6794 million which is discussed in note 11   goodwill  we also test certain equipment and deferred cost balances associated with contracts when the contract is materially underperforming or is expected to materially underperform in the future as compared to the original bid model or budget if the projected cash flows of a particular contract are not adequate to recover the unamortized cost balance of the asset group the balance is adjusted in the tested period based on the contracts fair value either of these impairments could materially affect our reported net earnings 

we may not be able to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock in accordance with our announced intent or at all 

on april 3 2017 we announced the establishment of a share repurchase plan approved by the board of directors with an initial authorization of up to 20 billion for future repurchases of outstanding shares of our common stock on november 8 2018 dxc announced that its board of directors approved an incremental 20 billion share repurchase authorization starting fiscal 2018 we paid quarterly cash dividends to our stockholders in accordance with our announced dividend policy we intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend during fiscal 2021 but the declaration and payment of future dividends the amount of any such dividends and the establishment of record and payment dates for dividends if any are subject to final determination by our board of directors after review of our current strategy and financial performance and position among other things 

the board of directors’ determinations regarding dividends and share repurchases will depend on a variety of factors including net income cash flow generated from operations amount and location of our cash and investment balances overall liquidity position and potential alternative uses of cash such as acquisitions as well as economic conditions and expected future financial results there can be no guarantee that we will achieve our financial goals in the amounts or within the expected time frame or at all our ability to declare future dividends will depend on our future financial performance which in turn depends on the successful implementation of our strategy and on financial competitive regulatory and other factors general economic conditions demand and prices for our services and other factors specific to our industry or specific projects many of which are beyond our control therefore our ability to generate cash flow depends on the performance of our operations and could be limited by decreases in our profitability or increases in costs regulatory changes capital expenditures or debt servicing requirements 

any failure to achieve our financial goals could negatively impact our reputation harm investor confidence in us and cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

we are defendants in pending litigation that may have a material and adverse impact on our profitability and liquidity 

as noted in note 22   commitments and contingencies  we are currently party to a number of disputes that involve or may involve litigation or arbitration including a securities class action and other lawsuits in which we and certain of our officers and directors have been named as defendants the result of these lawsuits and any other future legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of their subject matter or merits such legal proceedings may result in significant cost to us which may not be covered by insurance may divert the attention of management or may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations negative publicity from litigation whether or not resulting in a substantial cost could materially damage our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and the price of our common stock in addition such legal proceedings may make it more difficult to finance our operations 

we may be adversely affected by disruptions in the credit markets including disruptions that reduce our customers access to credit and increase the costs to our customers of obtaining credit 

the credit markets have historically been volatile and therefore it is not possible to predict the ability of our clients and customers to access shortterm financing and other forms of capital if a disruption in the credit markets were to occur it could pose a risk to our business if customers or suppliers are unable to obtain financing to meet payment or delivery obligations to us in the event that one or more customers or suppliers defaults on its payment or delivery obligations we could incur significant losses which may harm our business reputation results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition customers may decide to downsize defer or cancel contracts which could negatively affect our revenues 

further as of march 31 2020 we have 52 billion of floating interest rate debt accordingly a spike in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

our hedging program is subject to counterparty default risk 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps with a number of counterparties as a result we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these contracts defaults on its performance under the contract during an economic downturn the counterpartys financial condition may deteriorate rapidly and with little notice and we may be unable to take action to protect our exposure in the event of a counterparty default we could incur significant losses which may harm our business and financial condition in the event that one or more of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy our ability to eventually recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterpartys default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty 

we derive significant revenues and profit from contracts awarded through competitive bidding processes which can impose substantial costs on us and we may not achieve revenue and profit objectives if we fail to bid on these projects effectively 

we derive significant revenues and profit from government contracts that are awarded through competitive bidding processes we expect that most of the nonus government business we seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through competitive bidding competitive bidding is expensive and presents a number of risks including 

 

if our customers experience financial difficulties we may not be able to collect our receivables which would materially and adversely affect our profitability and cash flows from operations 

over the course of a contract term a customers financial condition may decline and limit its ability to pay its obligations this could cause our cash collections to decrease and bad debt expense to increase while we may resort to alternative methods to pursue claims or collect receivables these methods are expensive and time consuming and successful collection is not guaranteed failure to collect our receivables or prevail on claims would have an adverse effect on our profitability and cash flows 

if we are unable to maintain and grow our customer relationships over time our operating results and cash flows will suffer failure to comply with customer contracts or government contracting regulations or requirements could adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows 

we devote significant resources to establish relationships with our customers and implement our offerings and related services particularly in the case of large enterprises that often request or require specific features or functions specific to their particular business profile accordingly our operating results depend in substantial part on our ability to deliver a successful customer experience and persuade customers to maintain and grow our relationship with us over time if we are not successful in implementing an offering or delivering a successful customer experience including achieving cost and staffing levels that meet our customers’ expectations customers could terminate or elect not to renew their agreements with us and our operating results may suffer 

contracts with customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements in particular our contracts with federal state provincial and local governmental customers are generally subject to various procurement regulations contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance including the maintenance of necessary security clearances contracts with us government agencies are also subject to audits and investigations which may include a review of performance on contracts pricing practices cost structure and compliance with applicable laws and regulations 

any failure on our part to comply with the specific provisions in customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations or other requirements could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments and in the case of government contracts fines and suspension from future government contracting such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business in addition we may be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to government contracts which could include claims for treble damages further any negative publicity with respect to customer contracts or any related proceedings regardless of accuracy may damage our business by harming our ability to compete for new contracts 

contracts with the us federal government and related agencies are also subject to issues with respect to federal budgetary and spending limits or matters any changes to the fiscal policies of the us federal government may decrease overall government funding result in delays in the procurement of products and services due to lack of funding cause the us federal government and government agencies to reduce their purchases under existing contracts or cause them to exercise their rights to terminate contracts at­ will or to abstain from exercising options to renew contracts any of which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows 

if our customer contracts are terminated if we are suspended or disbarred from government work or our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our financial performance could suffer 

recent us tax legislation may materially affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

recently enacted us tax legislation has significantly changed the us federal income taxation of us corporations including by reducing the us corporate income tax rate limiting interest deductions permitting immediate expensing of certain capital expenditures adopting elements of a territorial tax system imposing a onetime transition tax or “repatriation tax” on all undistributed earnings and profits of certain usowned foreign corporations revising the rules governing net operating losses and the rules governing foreign tax credits and introducing new antibase erosion provisions many of these changes were effective immediately without any transition periods or grandfathering for existing transactions the legislation is unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the us department of the treasury and internal revenue service irs any of which could lessen or increase certain impacts of the legislation in addition state and local jurisdictions continue to issue guidance on how these us federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities 

while our analysis and interpretation of this legislation is ongoing based on our current evaluation we recorded a provisional reduction of our deferred income tax liabilities resulting in a material noncash benefit to earnings during fiscal 2018 the period in which the tax legislation was enacted which was adjusted in fiscal 2019 additionally the repatriation tax resulted in a material amount of additional us tax liability the majority of which was reflected as an income tax expense in fiscal 2018 when the tax legislation was enacted despite the fact that the resulting tax may be paid over eight years further there may be other material adverse effects resulting from future guidance including technical corrections 

in addition on march 27 2020 the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act “cares act” was enacted in respect to the recent outbreak of covid19 the cares act among other things includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits the ability to utilize and carryback certain net operating losses alternative minimum tax refunds and modifications to rules regarding the deductibility of net interest expense 

while some of the changes made by recent tax legislation may be beneficial to the company in one or more reporting periods and prospectively other changes may be adverse on a going forward basis we continue to work with our tax advisors to determine the full impact that recent tax legislation as a whole will have on us 

changes in our tax rates could affect our future results 

our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

risks related to the hpes merger 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits from the hpes merger 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to realize the intended benefits of the hpes merger or that we will perform as anticipated 

our success in realizing cost and revenues synergies growth opportunities and other financial and operating benefits as a result of the hpes merger and the timing of this realization depends on the successful integration of our business operations even if we successfully integrate we cannot predict with certainty if or when these cost and revenue synergies growth opportunities and benefits will occur or the extent to which they actually will be achieved in addition the quantification of previously announced synergies expected to result from the hpes merger is based on significant estimates and assumptions that are subjective in nature and inherently uncertain realization of any benefits and synergies could be affected by a number of factors beyond our control including without limitation general economic conditions increased operating costs regulatory developments and other risks the amount of synergies actually realized if any and the time periods in which any such synergies are realized could differ materially from the expected synergies regardless of whether the two business operations are combined successfully if the integration is unsuccessful or if we are unable to realize the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the hpes merger there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the integration following the hpes merger may continue to present significant challenges 

there is a significant degree of difficulty inherent in the process of integrating hpes and csc these difficulties include 

 

the ongoing process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of one or more of our businesses members of senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process which would decrease the time they have to manage our business service existing businesses and develop new services or strategies in addition certain existing contractual restrictions limit the ability to engage in certain integration activities for varying periods after the hpes merger there is no assurance we will be able to continue to manage this integration to the extent or in the time horizon anticipated particularly given the larger scale of the hpes business in comparison to cscs business if senior management is not able to timely and effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business could suffer the delay or inability to achieve anticipated integration goals could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations after the hpes merger 

we could have an indemnification obligation to hpe if the stock distribution in connection with the hpes business separation the distribution were determined not to qualify for taxfree treatment which could materially adversely affect our financial condition 

if due to any of our representations being untrue or our covenants being breached the distribution was determined not to qualify for taxfree treatment under section 355 of the internal revenue code the code hpe would generally be subject to tax as if it sold the dxc common stock in a taxable transaction which could result in a material tax liability in addition each hpe stockholder who received dxc common stock in the distribution would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the dxc common stock received by the stockholder in the distribution 

under the tax matters agreement we were required to indemnify hpe against taxes resulting from the distribution or certain aspects of the hpes merger arising as a result of an everett tainting act as defined in the tax matters agreement if we were required to indemnify hpe for taxes resulting from an everett tainting act that indemnification obligation would likely be substantial and could materially adversely affect our financial condition 

if the hpes merger does not qualify as a reorganization under section 368a of the code cscs former stockholders may incur significant tax liabilities 

the completion of the hpes merger was conditioned upon the receipt by hpe and csc of opinions of counsel to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the hpes merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368a of the code the hpes merger tax opinions the parties did not seek a ruling from the irs regarding such qualification the hpes merger tax opinions were based on current law and relied upon various factual representations and assumptions as well as certain undertakings made by hpe hpes and csc if any of those representations or assumptions is untrue or incomplete in any material respect or any of those undertakings is not complied with or if the facts upon which the hpes merger tax opinions are based are materially different from the actual facts that existed at the time of the hpes merger the conclusions reached in the hpes merger tax opinions could be adversely affected and the hpes merger may not qualify for taxfree treatment opinions of counsel are not binding on the irs or the courts no assurance can be given that the irs will not challenge the conclusions set forth in the hpes merger tax opinions or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the hpes merger were determined to be taxable previous holders of csc common stock would be considered to have made a taxable disposition of their shares to hpes and such stockholders would generally recognize taxable gain or loss on their receipt of hpes common stock in the hpes merger 

we assumed certain material pension benefit obligations in connection with the hpes merger these liabilities and the related future funding obligations could restrict our cash available for operations capital expenditures and other requirements and may materially adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity 

pursuant to the employee matters agreement entered into in connection with the hpes merger while hpe retained all us defined benefit pension plan liabilities dxc retained all liabilities relating to the international retirement guarantee “irg” programs for all hpes employees the irg is a nonqualified retirement plan for employees who transfer internationally at the request of the hpe group the irg determines the country of guarantee which is generally the country in which an employee has spent the longest portion of his or her career with the hpe group and the present value of a full career benefit for the employee under the hpe defined benefit pension plan and social security or social insurance system in the country of guarantee the irg then offsets the present value of the retirement benefits from plans and social insurance systems in the countries in which the employee earned retirement benefits for his or her total period of hpe group employment the net benefit value is payable as a single sum as soon as practicable after termination or retirement this liability could restrict cash available for our operations capital expenditures and other requirements and may materially affect our financial condition and liquidity 

in addition pursuant to the employee matters agreement dxc assumed certain other defined benefit pension liabilities in a number of nonus countries including the united kingdom germany and switzerland unless otherwise agreed or required by local law where a defined benefit pension plan was maintained solely by a member of the hpes business dxc assumed all assets and liabilities arising out of those nonus defined benefit pension plans and where a defined benefit pension plan was not maintained solely by a member of the hpes business dxc assumed all assets and liabilities for those eligible hpes employees in connection with the hpes merger these liabilities and the related future payment obligations could restrict cash available for our operations capital expenditures and other requirements and may materially affect our financial condition and liquidity 

risks related to the luxoft acquisition 

the luxoft acquisition may result in disruptions to relationships with customers and other business partners 

this transaction could cause disruptions in our business and the luxoft business including by disrupting operations or causing customers to delay or to defer decisions or to end their relationships or otherwise limiting the ability to compete for or perform certain contracts or services if we and luxoft face difficulties in integrating our businesses or the luxoft business faces difficulties in its business generally the luxoft acquisition may not achieve the intended results 

further it is possible that current or prospective employees of our business and the luxoft business could experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company which could harm our ability to attract and retain key personnel any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the actions required to implement the luxoft acquisition will take management time and attention and may require us to incur additional costs 

the luxoft acquisition will require managements time and resources which will be in addition to and may divert from managements time and attention to the operation of our existing businesses and the execution of our other strategic initiatives additionally we may incur additional costs in connection with the luxoft acquisition beyond those that are currently anticipated 

risks related to previous spinoffs 

the usps separation and mergers and nps separation could result in substantial tax liability to dxc and our stockholders 

among the closing conditions to completing the usps separation and mergers we received a legal opinion of tax counsel substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes i the usps separation qualifies as a “reorganization” within the meaning of section 368a1d of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” ii each of dxc and perspecta is a “party to a reorganization” within the meaning of section 368b of the code with respect to the usps separation iii the distribution qualifies as 1 a taxfree spinoff resulting in nonrecognition under sections 355a 361 and 368a of the code and 2 a transaction in which the stock distributed thereby should constitute “qualified property” for purposes of sections 355d 355e and 361c of the code and iv none of the mergers causes section 355e of the code to apply to the distribution if notwithstanding the conclusions expressed in these opinions the usps separation and mergers were determined to be taxable dxc and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities 

in addition prior to the hpes merger csc spun off its north american public sector business nps on november 27 2015 the nps separation in connection with the nps separation csc received an opinion of counsel substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the nps separation qualified as a taxfree transaction to csc and holders of csc common stock under section 355 and related provisions of the code the completion of the hpes merger was conditioned upon the receipt of csc of an opinion of counsel to the effect that the hpes merger should not cause section 355e of the code to apply to the nps separation or otherwise affect the qualification of the nps separation as a taxfree distribution under section 355 of the code  if notwithstanding the conclusions expressed in these opinions the nps separation were determined to be taxable csc and csc stockholders that received csra inc csra stock in the nps separation could incur significant tax liabilities 

the opinions of counsel we received were based on among other things various factual representations and assumptions as well as certain undertakings made by dxc perspecta and csra if any of those representations or assumptions is untrue or incomplete in any material respect or any of those undertakings is not complied with the conclusions reached in the opinion could be adversely affected and the usps separation or the nps separation may not qualify for taxfree treatment furthermore an opinion of counsel is not binding on the irs or the courts accordingly no assurance can be given that the irs will not challenge the conclusions set forth in the opinions or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if notwithstanding our receipt of the opinions the usps separation or nps separation is determined to be taxable we would recognize taxable gain as if we had sold the shares of perspecta or csra in a taxable sale for its fair market value which could result in a substantial tax liability in addition if the usps separation or nps separation is determined to be taxable each holder of our common stock who received shares of perspecta or csra would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received which could materially increase such holder’s tax liability 

additionally even if the usps separation otherwise qualifies as a taxfree transaction the distribution could be taxable to us but not to our shareholders in certain circumstances if future significant acquisitions of our stock or the stock of perspecta are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution in this event the resulting tax liability could be substantial in connection with the usps separation we entered into a tax matters agreement with perspecta under which it agreed not to undertake any transaction without our consent that could reasonably be expected to cause the usps separation to be taxable to us and to indemnify us for any tax liabilities resulting from such transactions these obligations and potential tax liabilities could be substantial 

risks related to the proposed sale of the us state and local health and human services business to veritas capital 

the hhs sale is contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions and the transaction may not be consummated on the terms or timeline currently contemplated or at all 

on march 9 2020 we entered into a purchase agreement with milano acquisition corp “milano” a corporation affiliated with veritas capital fund management llc we currently expect that the transaction if completed will occur by the december 31 2020 pursuant to the purchase agreement milano will acquire dxc’s us state and local health and human services business for total cash consideration of 50 billion the “hhs sale” we expect to use the aftertax proceeds from the hhs sale to repay outstanding indebtedness

the proposed transaction may result in disruptions to relationships with customers and other business partners or may not achieve the intended results 

if we complete the proposed hhs sale there can be no assurance that we will be able to realize the intended benefits of the transaction specifically the proposed hhs sale could cause disruptions in our remaining businesses including by disrupting operations or causing customers to delay or to defer decisions or to end their relationships or otherwise limiting the ability to compete for or perform certain contracts or services any of the foregoing could adversely affect our remaining businesses the financial condition of such businesses and their results of operations and prospects the hhs business is accounted for as part of the gbs segment 

the actions required to implement the hhs sale will take significant management time and attention and will require us to incur significant costs 

the hhs sale will require significant amounts of management’s time and resources which will be in addition to and may divert management’s time and attention from the operation of our remaining businesses and the execution of our other strategic initiatives additionally we will incur costs in connection with the hhs sale these costs must be paid regardless of whether the hhs sale is consummated

results of operations 

the following table sets forth certain financial data for fiscal 2020 and 2019 



fiscal 2020 highlights 

fiscal 2020 financial highlights include the following 

 

revenues 



the decrease in revenues for fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019 reflects the impact of pricedowns runoff and termination of certain accounts offset by increase in revenue in fiscal 2020 due to contributions from the luxoft acquisition fiscal 2020 revenues included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 22  primarily driven by the strengthening of the us dollar against the australian dollar euro and british pound 

during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 the distribution of our revenues across geographies was as follows 

for a discussion of risks associated with our foreign operations see part i item 1a risk factors of this annual report 

as a global company over 63 of our fiscal 2020 revenues were earned internationally as a result the comparison of revenues denominated in currencies other than the us dollar from period to period is impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates constant currency revenues are a nongaap measure calculated by translating current period activity into us dollars using the comparable prior period’s currency conversion rates this information is consistent with how management views our revenues and evaluates our operating performance and trends the table below summarizes our constant currency revenues 



global business services 

our gbs segment revenues were 91 billion for fiscal 2020 representing an increase of 04 billion  or 49  compared to fiscal 2019 the revenue increase included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 02 billion  or 21  gbs revenues in constant currency were 93 billion for fiscal 2020 representing an increase of 06 billion  or 70  the increase in gbs revenue in fiscal 2020 is due to contributions from the luxoft acquisition which closed in june 2019  

global infrastructure services 

our gis segment revenues were 105 billion for fiscal 2020 representing a decrease of 16 billion  or 133  compared to fiscal 2019 the revenue decline included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 03 billion  or 22  gis revenues in constant currency were 107 billion for fiscal 2020 representing a decrease of 13 billion  or 111  the decrease in gis revenue in fiscal 2020 reflects the impact of pricedowns runoff and termination of certain accounts 

during fiscal 2020 gbs and gis had contract awards of 90 billion and 87 billion  respectively compared with 93 billion and 114 billion  respectively during fiscal 2019 

costs and expenses 

our total costs and expenses were as follows 



the 340 point increase in costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2020 primarily reflects our goodwill impairment losses which were partially offset by the gain on arbitration award and other income 

costs of services 

cost of services excluding depreciation and amortization and restructuring costs cos was 149 billion for fiscal 2020 including luxoft which was flat compared to fiscal 2019 cos as percentage of revenue increased 39 points compared to fiscal 2019 this increase was driven by the ongoing investments we are making to secure our customers and higher cost takeout activities in the prior year 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expense excluding depreciation and amortization and restructuring costs sga was 21 billion for fiscal 2020 as compared to 20 billion for fiscal 2019 sga increased 01 billion  and as a percentage of revenue increased 11 points compared to fiscal 2019 the increase includes sga related to the luxoft acquisition which we acquired during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 

integration separation and transactionrelated costs included in sga were 318 million during fiscal 2020 as compared to 401 million during fiscal 2019 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expense da was 19 billion for fiscal 2020 compared to 20 billion for fiscal 2019 the decrease in da was primarily due to a 225 million benefit respectively from a change in estimated useful lives of certain equipment described in note 1    summary of significant accounting policies  offset by an increase in depreciation on assets placed into service as well as increases in software amortization and amortization related to accelerated transition and transformation contract costs 

goodwill impairment losses 

dxc recognized goodwill impairment charges totaling 6794 million during fiscal 2020 the impairment charges were primarily the result of a sustained decline in market capitalization during the fiscal 2020 see note 11   goodwill  for additional information 

restructuring costs 

restructuring costs represent severance related to workforce optimization programs and expense associated with facilities and data center rationalization 

during fiscal 2020  management approved global cost savings initiatives designed to reduce operating costs by rebalancing our workforce and facilities structures the fiscal 2020 global cost savings initiatives were designed to better align our organizational structure with our strategic initiatives and continue the integration of hpes and other acquisitions 

total restructuring costs recorded net of reversals during fiscal 2020 and 2019 were 252 million and 465 million  respectively the net amounts recorded included 10 million and 2 million of pension benefit augmentations for fiscal 2020 and 2019  respectively owed to certain employees under legal or contractual obligations these augmentations will be paid as part of normal pension distributions over several years 

see note 21   restructuring costs  for additional information about our restructuring actions 

interest expense and interest income 

interest expense for fiscal 2020 was 383 million as compared to 334 million in fiscal 2019  the increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in borrowings and asset financing activities see the capital resources caption below and note 13   “ debt ” for additional information 

interest income for fiscal 2020 was 165 million  as compared to 128 million in fiscal 2019  the yearoveryear increase in interest income includes preaward interest of 34 million and postaward interest of 2 million related to arbitration discussed below under the caption “gain on arbitration award” 

gain on arbitration award 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 dxc received final arbitration award proceeds of 666 million related to the hpe enterprise services merger completed in fiscal 2018 the arbitration award included 632 million in damages that were recorded as a gain the remaining 34 million of the award related to preaward interest dispute details are subject to confidentiality obligations 

other income net 

other income net includes nonservice cost components of net periodic pension income movement in foreign currency exchange rates on our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and the related economic hedges equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates gain on sale of nonoperating assets and other miscellaneous gains and losses 

the components of other income net for fiscal 2020 and 2019 are as follows 



the 414 million increase in other income for fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year was due to a yearoveryear increase of 476 million in nonservice components of net periodic pension income and a yearoveryear favorable foreign currency impact of 56 million  these increases were offset by a 118 million decrease in other gains related to sales of nonoperating assets 

taxes 

our effective tax rate etr on income loss from continuing operations before taxes for fiscal 2020 and 2019 was 25 and 190 respectively a reconciliation of the differences between the us federal statutory rate and the etr as well as other information about our income tax provision is provided in note 12   income taxes  

in fiscal 2020 the etr was primarily impacted by 

 

in fiscal 2019 the etr was primarily impacted by 

 

in fiscal 2018 the etr was primarily impacted by 

 

the irs is examining cscs federal income tax returns for fiscal 2008 through 2017 with respect to cscs fiscal 2008 through 2010 federal tax returns we previously entered into negotiations for a resolution through settlement with the irs office of appeals the irs examined several issues for this audit that resulted in various audit adjustments we have an agreement in principle with the irs office of appeals as to some but not all of these adjustments we have agreed to extend the statute of limitations associated with this audit through september 30 2020 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 we filed for competent authority relief relating to certain legacy csc foreign restructuring expenses deducted for the u s federal tax return for tax year march 31 2013 the company has agreed to extend the statute of limitations associated with the fiscal years 2011 through 2013 through december 31 2020 in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 the company received a revenue agents report with proposed adjustments to cscs fiscal 2014 through 2017 federal returns the company has filed a protest for certain of these adjustments with the irs office of appeals the company has agreed to extend the statute of limitations for the fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2016 through december 31 2020 and for the employment tax audit of fiscal years 2015 and 2016 until january 31 2021 the company expects to reach a resolution for all years no earlier than the first quarter of fiscal 2022 except agreed issues related to fiscal 2008 through 2010 and fiscal 2011 through 2013 federal tax returns which are expected to be resolved within twelve months 

in addition we may settle certain other tax examinations have lapses in statutes of limitations or voluntarily settle income tax positions in negotiated settlements for different amounts than we have accrued as uncertain tax positions we may need to accrue and ultimately pay additional amounts for tax positions that previously met a more likely than not standard if such positions are not upheld conversely we could settle positions by payment with the tax authorities for amounts lower than those that have been accrued or extinguish a position through payment we believe the outcomes that are reasonably possible within the next twelve months may result in a reduction in liability for uncertain tax positions of 25 million to 27 million excluding interest penalties and tax carryforwards 

income from discontinued operations 

the 35 million of income from discontinued operations for the fiscal year 2019 reflects the net income generated by usps during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 

earnings per share 

diluted eps from continuing operations for fiscal 2020 was 2076  a decrease of 2511 per share compared with the prior fiscal year the eps decrease was due to a decrease of 6585 million in income from continuing operations 

diluted eps for fiscal 2020 includes 080 per share of restructuring costs 098 per share of transaction separation and integrationrelated costs 173 per share of amortization of acquired intangible assets 2578 per share of goodwill impairment losses 243 per share of arbitration award gains 074 per share of pension and opeb actuarial and settlement gains and 013 per share of tax adjustment relating to prior restructuring charges 

nongaap financial measures 

we present nongaap financial measures of performance which are derived from the statements of operations of dxc these nongaap financial measures include earnings before interest and taxes ebit adjusted ebit nongaap income before income taxes nongaap net income and nongaap eps constant currency revenues net debt and net debttototal capitalization 

we present these nongaap financial measures to provide investors with meaningful supplemental financial information in addition to the financial information presented on a gaap basis nongaap financial measures exclude certain items from gaap results which dxc management believes are not indicative of core operating performance dxc management believes these nongaap measures allow investors to better understand the financial performance of dxc exclusive of the impacts of corporatewide strategic decisions dxc management believes that adjusting for these items provides investors with additional measures to evaluate the financial performance of our core business operations on a comparable basis from period to period dxc management believes the nongaap measures provided are also considered important measures by financial analysts covering dxc as equity research analysts continue to publish estimates and research notes based on our nongaap commentary including our guidance around nongaap eps targets 

nongaap financial measures exclude certain items from gaap results which dxc management believes are not indicative of operating performance such as the amortization of acquired intangible assets and transaction separation and integrationrelated costs 

incremental amortization of intangible assets acquired through business combinations may result in a significant difference in period over period amortization expense on a gaap basis we exclude amortization of certain acquired intangibles assets as these noncash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing andor size of acquisitions although dxc management excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets primarily customer related intangible assets from its nongaap expenses we believe that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and support revenue generation any future transactions may result in a change to the acquired intangible asset balances and associated amortization expense 

there are limitations to the use of the nongaap financial measures presented in this report one of the limitations is that they do not reflect complete financial results we compensate for this limitation by providing a reconciliation between our nongaap financial measures and the respective most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap additionally other companies including companies in our industry may calculate nongaap financial measures differently than we do limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes between companies 

  

nongaap financial measures and the respective most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap include 



reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

our nongaap adjustments include 

 

a reconciliation of reported results to nongaap results is as follows 





  

 the net periodic pension cost within income from continuing operations includes 700 million of actual return on plan assets whereas the net periodic pension cost within nongaap income from continuing operations includes 570 million of expected longterm return on pension assets of defined benefit plans subject to interim remeasurement 

reconciliations of net income to adjusted ebit are as follows 



liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents and cash flows 

as of march 31 2020  our cash and cash equivalents cash were 37 billion  of which 12 billion was held outside of the united states a substantial portion of funds can be returned to the us from funds advanced previously to finance our foreign acquisition initiatives as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 and after the mandatory onetime income inclusion deemed repatriation of the historically untaxed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and current income inclusions for global intangible low taxed income we expect a significant portion of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries will no longer be subject to us federal income tax consequences upon subsequent repatriation to the us however a portion of this cash may still be subject to foreign income tax consequences upon future remittance therefore if additional funds held outside the us are needed for our operations in the us we plan to repatriate these funds 

cash was 37 billion and 29 billion as of march 31 2020 and march 31 2019  respectively the following table summarizes our cash flow activity 



operating cash flow 

net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2020 was 2350 million as compared to 1783 million during fiscal 2019 the increase of 567 million was due to an increase in net income net of adjustments of 458 million  which includes an increase in working capital movements of 109 million  net income net of adjustments includes cash received on arbitration award of 668 million 

investing cash flow 

net cash used in provided by investing activities during fiscal 2020 was 2137 million as compared to 69 million during fiscal 2019 the increase of 2206 million was primarily due to an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of 1632 million  a decrease in cash collections related to deferred purchase price receivable of 413 million  a decrease in proceeds from sale of assets of 284 million  and net shortterm investing of 37 million  the increase is partially offset by a decrease in payments for transition and transformation costs of 113 million and cash paid for business dispositions of 65 million in fiscal 2019 

financing cash flow 

net cash provided by used in financing activities during fiscal 2020 was 657 million  as compared to 1663 million during fiscal 2019 the 2320 million increase was primarily due to borrowings under lines of credit in fiscal 2020 of 15 billion  additional borrowings on longterm debt of 552 million  a decrease in payments on longterm debt of 1586 million  and lower repurchases of common stock and advance payment for accelerated share repurchase of 608 million  this was partially offset by an increase in repayments of commercial paper of 44 million  borrowings for the usps spin transaction of 1114 million in fiscal 2019 and proceeds from bond issuance of 753 million in fiscal 2019 

capital resources 

see note 22   commitments and contingencies  for a discussion of the general purpose of guarantees and commitments the anticipated sources of funds to fulfill such commitments are listed below and under the subheading liquidity 

the following table summarizes our total debt 



the 25 billion increase in total debt during fiscal 2020 was primarily attributed to the 15 billion borrowing from the credit facility agreement and the new term loan credit agreement in an aggregate principal of 22 billion  consisting of three tranches i 500 million maturing on fiscal 2025 ii €750 million maturing on fiscal 2022 and iii €750 million maturing on fiscal 2023 the proceeds from the new term loan credit agreement was used to finance the luxoft acquisition additionally we repaid the 500 million senior notes due 2020 and 500 million senior notes due 2021 during fiscal 2020 see note 13   debt  for more information 

we were in compliance with all financial covenants associated with our borrowings as of march 31 2020 and march 31 2019 

the debt maturity chart below summarizes the future maturities of longterm debt principal for fiscal years subsequent to march 31 2020 and excludes maturities of borrowings for assets acquired under longterm financing and capitalized lease liabilities see note 13   debt  for more information 

the following table summarizes our capitalization ratios 



  

1 net debt and net debttototal capitalization are nongaap measures used by management to assess our ability to service our debts using only our cash and cash equivalents we present these nongaap measures to assist investors in analyzing our capital structure in a more comprehensive way compared to gross debt based ratios alone 

net debttototal capitalization as of march 31 2020 increased as compared to march 31 2019  primarily due to the increase in total debt attributed to the luxoft acquisition borrowing from the credit facility agreement the decrease in cash and cash equivalents used to pay down senior notes and the decrease in equity resulting from goodwill impairment charges reported during fiscal 2020 

as of march 31 2020  our credit ratings were as follows 



for information on the risks of ratings downgrades see item 1a  risk factors our credit rating and ability to manage working capital refinance and raise additional capital for future needs could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing cost and access to capital markets 

see note 22   commitments and contingencies  for a discussion of the general purpose of guarantees and commitments the anticipated sources of funds to fulfill such commitments are listed below 

liquidity 

we expect our existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our normal operating requirements for the next 12 months we expect to continue using cash generated by operations as a primary source of liquidity however should we require funds greater than that generated from our operations to fund discretionary investment activities such as business acquisitions we have the ability to raise capital through the issuance of capital market debt instruments such as commercial paper term loans and bonds in addition we currently utilize and will further utilize our cross currency cash pool for liquidity needs however there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain debt financing if required on terms and conditions acceptable to us if at all in the future 

our exposure to operational liquidity risk is primarily from longterm contracts which require significant investment of cash during the initial phases of the contracts the recovery of these investments is over the life of the contract and is dependent upon our performance as well as customer acceptance 

the following table summarizes our total liquidity 



during march 2020 as the evolving global covid19 pandemic crisis resulted in increasing government actions to shut down economic activity and enforce stayathome orders global capital markets were disrupted and became tumultuous including the near shut down of commercial paper markets for issuers such as the company as shortterm fixed income investors prepared for potential redemptions on march 24 2020  the company announced the drawdown of 15 billion from its revolving credit facility due 2025 in order to increase cash on hand and eliminate the reliance on commercial paper markets along with the suspension of the company’s euro and usd commercial paper program until the company deems such capital markets stabilized and reliable as a result the company’s commercial paper outstanding was reduced to 542 million as of march 31 2020  and another 318 million is scheduled to mature during the quarter ending june 30 2020  which the company currently expects to fund such maturing euro commercial paper from its cash on hand while central bank actions have improved liquidity in commercial paper markets overall there is no assurance that the company at its commercial program ratings of p2f2 will have reliable access in the future or if accessible at reasonable costs 

on april 6 2020 subsequent to the fiscal period end the company drew the entire 25 billion remaining availability under its revolving credit facilities in order to secure liquidity as additional cash on hand to support the company’s liquidity resources during the covid pandemic crisis and to mitigate the uncertainties caused by volatile capital markets changing governmental policies and evolving impact on world economies 

subsequent to the end of the fiscal period the company issued 10 billion in principal amount of senior notes in the form of 500 million principal amount of 40 senior notes due 2023 and 500 million principal amount of 4125 senior notes due 2025  all the net proceeds from the notes offerings were applied towards the early prepayment of the company’s term loan facilities including prepayment of €500 million of euro term loan due fiscal 2022  £150 million of gbp term loan due fiscal 2022  a300 million of aud term loan due fiscal 2022  and 100 million of usd term loan due fiscal 2025  

on may 15 2020  the company agreed with its lenders and modified the definition of leverage ratio to be measured on a “net of cash” basis across all of the company’s bank credit and term loan facilities and for such newly defined leverage ratio limitation of total consolidated net indebtedness to adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization as defined in such credit and term loan facilities currently at 30x to be reduced to 225x thereafter beginning the fiscal year ending march 31 2022 with the first quarterly measurement date as of june 30 2021  the net effect of such adjustment to the leverage ratio definition in the company’s credit and term loan facilities is to allow the company the flexibility to maintain elevated cash balances going forward both during current circumstances and thereafter without constraining the company’s strategy of maintaining strong access to liquidity during the covid pandemic crisis the company’s credit and term loan facilities that were modified include 40 billion revolving credit facilities due fiscal year 2025 including a 70 million subtranche due fiscal 2024  €250 million euro term loan due fiscal year 2022 a substantial portion was extended to mature in fiscal year 2023 pursuant to the euro term loan extension see below €750 million euro term loan due fiscal year 2023 a substantial portion was extended to mature in fiscal year 2024 pursuant to the euro term loan extension see below £300 million in gbp term loan due fiscal year 2022  a500 million in aud term loan due fiscal year 2022  and approximately 382 million in outstanding usd term loan due fiscal year 2025  

on may 15 2020  the company initiated elective extension amendments in accordance with the terms of the aggregate €10 billion principal amount of euro term loans outstanding accordingly €2167 million out of €250 million euro term loan due fiscal year 2022 agreed to extend maturity 12months to mature fiscal year 2023  and €700 million out of total €750 million euro term loan due fiscal year 2023 agreed to extend maturity 12months to mature fiscal year 2024  margin would increase during the 12month extension terms to euribor  125bps and euribor  175bps respectively for the euro term loans originally due fiscal years 2022 and 2023  which would be an increase from the current applicable margin of euribor  65bps and euribor  80 bps respectively there is no change to current margin or terms through the original maturity term of the euro term loans 

the debt maturity chart below summarizes the future maturities of longterm debt principal taking into effect borrowings and prepayments as mentioned above for fiscal years subsequent to may 15 2020 and excludes maturities of borrowings for assets acquired under longterm financing and capitalized lease liabilities 

share repurchases 

during fiscal 2018 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 20 billion of our common stock and during fiscal 2019 we announced that our board of directors had approved an incremental 20 billion share repurchase authorization an expiration date has not been established for this repurchase plan during fiscal 2020 we repurchased 15933651 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 736 million  see note 15   stockholders equity  for more information 

dividends 

during fiscal 2020 our board of directors declared aggregate cash dividends to our stockholders of 084 per share or approximately 219 million  to enhance our financial flexibility under current uncertain market conditions we have elected to suspend payment of a quarterly dividend this decision will be reevaluated by the board of dxc technology as market conditions stabilize 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business we are a party to arrangements that include guarantees the receivables securitization facility and certain other financial instruments with offbalance sheet risk such as letters of credit and surety bonds we also use performance letters of credit to support various risk management insurance policies no liabilities related to these arrangements are reflected in balance sheets see note 5   receivables  and note 22   commitments and contingencies  for additional information regarding these offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

contractual obligations

6 see note 14   pension and other benefit plans  for the estimated liability related to estimated future benefit payments under our pension and opeb plans that have been omitted from this table 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities these estimates may change in the future if underlying assumptions or factors change accordingly actual results could differ materially from our estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions we consider the following policies to be critical because of their complexity and the high degree of judgment involved in implementing them revenue recognition income taxes business combinations defined benefit plans and valuation of assets we have discussed the selection of our critical accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 

revenue recognition 

most of our revenues are recognized based on objective criteria and do not require significant estimates that may change over time however some arrangements may require significant estimates including contracts which include multiple performance obligations  

contracts with multiple performance obligations 

many of our contracts require us to provide a range of services or performance obligations to our customers which may include a combination of services products or both as a result significant judgment may be required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the elements specified in contracts with multiple performance obligations should be treated as separate performance obligations for revenue recognition purposes and when considered appropriate how the total transaction price should be allocated among the performance obligations and the timing of revenue recognition for each for contracts with multiple performance obligations we allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract other than software sales involving multiple performance obligations the primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin approach under which we forecast our expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that distinct good or service certain of our contracts involve the sale of dxc proprietary software post contract customer support and other softwarerelated services the standalone selling price generally is determined for each performance obligation using an adjusted market assessment approach based on the price charged where each deliverable is sold separately in certain limited cases typically for software licenses when the historical selling price is highly variable the residual approach is used this approach allocates revenue to the performance obligation equal to the difference between the total transaction price and the observable standalone selling prices for the other performance obligations these methods involve significant judgments and estimates that we assess periodically by considering market and entityspecific factors such as type of customer features of the products or services and market conditions 

once the total revenues have been allocated to the various performance obligations revenues for each are recognized based on the relevant revenue recognition method for each estimates of total revenues at contract inception often differ materially from actual revenues due to volume differences changes in technology or other factors which may not be foreseen at inception 

costs to obtain contracts with customers 

accounting for the costs to obtain contracts with customers requires significant judgments and estimates with regards to the determination of sales commission payments that qualify for deferral of costs and the related amortization period most of our sales commission plans are quotabased and payments are made by achieving targets related to a large number of new and renewed contracts certain sales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer we defer and amortize these costs on a straightline basis over an average period of benefit of five years which is determined and regularly assessed by considering the length of our customer contracts our technology and other factors significant changes in these estimates or impairment may result if material contracts terminate earlier than the expected benefit period or if there are material changes in the average contract period 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes analyzing our income tax reserves the determination of the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets and any corresponding adjustment of valuation allowances in addition our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions 

as a global enterprise our etr is affected by many factors including our global mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates the extent to which our nonus earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the us changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets changes in tax regulations acquisitions dispositions and the tax characteristics of our income we cannot predict what our etr will be in the future because there is uncertainty regarding these factors 

the majority of unremitted earnings has been taxed in the us through the transition tax and global intangible low tax income tax in connection with 2017 us tax reform the company was not permanently reinvested in all jurisdictions with the exception of india as of march 31 2019 as a result of the issuance of new us treasury regulations in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 the company changed its permanent reinvestment assertion in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 with respect to certain foreign corporations reducing the amount that will ultimately be repatriated to the us by approximately 492 million however as of march 31 2020 the company anticipates that future earnings in india will not be indefinitely reinvested this change resulted from the companys determination that it is now efficient to repatriate earnings in india as a result of the enactment of india finance act 2020 on march 27 2020 and change in cash needs resulting from the economic consequences of the covid19 pandemic we expect a significant portion of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries will no longer be subject to us federal income tax upon repatriation to the us however a portion of this cash may still be subject to foreign and us state tax consequences when remitted 

considerations impacting the recoverability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates in determining whether the deferred tax assets are realizable we consider all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences taxable income in prior carryback years projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations we recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of approximately  22 billion as of march 31 2020 due to uncertainties related to the ability to utilize these assets however valuation allowances are subject to change in future reporting periods due to changes in various factors 

recent enactment of the cares act or changes in tax laws resulting from the organization for economic cooperation and development’s multijurisdictional plan of action to address “base erosion and profit shifting” could impact our effective tax rate the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex changing tax regulations the company is currently evaluating the impact of the cares act the cares act makes a technical correction to the 2017 us tax reform to provide a 15year recovery period for qualified improvement property qip this correction makes qip eligible for bonus depreciation and is effective as if enacted as part of the 2017 us tax reform accordingly the company has applied bonus depreciation on certain qip cares also includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits the ability to utilize and carryback certain net operating losses alternative minimum tax refunds and modifications to rules regarding the deductibility of net interest expense 

business combinations 

we account for the acquisition of a business using the acquisition method of accounting which requires us to estimate the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed this includes acquired intangible assets such as customerrelated intangibles the liabilities assumed and contingent consideration if any liabilities assumed may include litigation and other contingency reserves existing at the time of acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining the related fair values independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities such appraisals are based on significant estimates provided by us such as forecasted revenues or profits utilized in determining the fair value of contractrelated acquired intangible assets or liabilities significant changes in assumptions and estimates subsequent to completing the allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired as well as differences in actual and estimated results could result in material impacts to our financial results adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in earnings additional information related to the acquisition date fair value of acquired assets and liabilities obtained during the allocation period not to exceed one year may result in 

changes to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the business acquired 

defined benefit plans 

  

the computation of our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations is dependent on various assumptions inherent in the application of the actuarial methods are key assumptions including discount rates expected longterm rates of return on plan assets mortality rates rates of compensation increases and medical cost trend rates our management evaluates these assumptions annually and updates assumptions as necessary the fair value of assets is determined based on observable inputs for similar assets or on significant unobservable inputs if not available two of the most significant assumptions are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate 

our weighted average rates used were 



the assumption for the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is impacted by the expected asset mix of the plan judgments regarding the correlation between historical excess returns and future excess returns and expected investment expenses the discount rate assumption is based on current market rates for highquality fixed income debt instruments with maturities similar to the expected duration of the benefit payment period the following table provides the impact changes in the weightedaverage assumptions would have had on our net periodic pension benefits and settlement and contractual termination charges for fiscal 2020 



valuation of assets 

we review longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill for impairment in accordance with our accounting policy disclosed in note 1  summary of significant accounting policies  assessing the fair value of assets involves significant estimates and assumptions including estimation of future cash flows the timing of such cash flows and discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in projecting future cash flows the valuation of longlived and intangible assets involves management estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of assets particularly purchased intangible assets these estimates are subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and forecasts 

evaluation of goodwill for impairment requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the identification of reporting units involves consideration of components of the operating segments and whether or not there is discrete financial information available that is regularly reviewed by management additionally we consider whether or not it is reasonable to aggregate any of the identified components that have similar economic characteristics the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors changes in these estimates and assumptions include a significant change in the business climate established business plans operating performance indicators or competition which could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach using performancemetric market multiples the discount rate used in an income approach is based on our weightedaverage cost of capital and may be adjusted for the relevant risks associated with businessspecific characteristics and any uncertainty related to a reporting units ability to execute on the projected future cash flows 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as a multinational company we are exposed to certain market risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates changes in foreign currency exchange rates can impact our foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions in foreign currency whereas changes in benchmark interest rates can impact interest expense associated with our floating interest rate debt and the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks including operating and financing activities and the use of derivative instruments we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

presented below is a description of our risks together with a sensitivity analysis of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates the foreign currency model incorporates the impact of diversification from holding multiple currencies and the correlation of revenues costs and any related shortterm contract financing in the same currency in order to determine the impact of changes in interest rates on our future results of operations and cash flows we calculated the increase or decrease in the index underlying these rates we estimate the fair value of our longterm debt primarily using an expected present value technique using interest rates offered to us for instruments with similar terms and remaining maturities these analyses reflect managements view of changes that are reasonably possible to occur over a oneyear period 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to both favorable and unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates in the ordinary course of business we enter into contracts denominated in foreign currencies exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising from these contracts is analyzed during the contract bidding process we generally manage these contracts by incurring costs in the same currency in which revenues are received and any related shortterm contract financing requirements are met by borrowing in the same currency thus by generally matching revenues costs and borrowings to the same currency we are able to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency risk to earnings however due to our increased use of offshore labor centers we have become more exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we experienced significant foreign currency fluctuations during fiscal 2020 due primarily to the volatility of the australian dollar british pound and euro in relation to the us dollar significant foreign currency fluctuations during fiscal 2019 was due primarily to the volatility of british pound and euro in relation to the us dollar 

we have policies and procedures to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency by using shortterm foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities including intercompany accounts and loans for accounting purposes these foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedges and changes in their fair value are reported in current period earnings within other income expense net in the statements of operations we also use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risk related to certain indian rupee denominated intercompany obligations and forecasted transactions for accounting purposes these foreign currency forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges with critical terms that match the hedged items therefore the changes in fair value of these forward contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income net of taxes in the statements of comprehensive income and subsequently classified into net income in the period during which the hedged transactions are recognized in net income 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than us dollar see note 19   segment and geographic information  during fiscal 2020  approximately 63 of our revenues were generated outside of the united states for the year ended march 31 2020  a hypothetical 10 change in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would have changed revenues by approximately 63  or 12 billion  the majority of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency and as a result there would not be a material change to our income from continuing operations before taxes as such in the view of management the resulting impact would not be material to our results of operations or cash flows 

interest rate risk 

as of march 31 2020  we had outstanding debt with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of 99 billion  of which 52 billion was floating interest rate debt most of our floating interest rate debt is based upon varying terms of adjusted libor rates consequently changes in libor result in the most volatility to our interest expense as of march 31 2020  an assumed 10 unfavorable change in interest rates would not be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flows a change in interest rates related to our longterm debt would not have a material impact on our financial statements as we do not record our debt at fair value

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

under the direction and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended as of the end of the period covered by this report to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the sec reports i is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the secs rules and forms and ii is accumulated and communicated to our management including the principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

based on this evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that dxcs disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of march 31 2020 because of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as described below and previously disclosed in our december 31 2019 form 10q in managements report on internal control over financial reporting notwithstanding this material weakness described below management has concluded that the companys consolidated financial statements for the periods covered by and included in this annual report on form 10k are fairly stated in all material respects in accordance with gaap for each of the periods presented herein 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 

our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements and receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and the directors of dxc and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements all internal control no matter how well designed have inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

during the year dxc acquired luxoft and excluded it from managements assessment of internal control over financial reporting the consolidated financial statements of the luxoft acquisition whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management’s assessment collectively represent 4 of total assets and revenues respectively as of and for the year ended march 31 2020 

management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria and framework established in internal control  integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of march 31 2020 because of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below 

a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that a reasonable possibility exists that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statement would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

control activities 

as previously disclosed in item 4 “controls and procedures” of our form 10q for the period ended december 31 2019 management concluded there was a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting related to the design and implementation of effective control activities based on the criteria established in the coso framework these control deficiencies constituted a material weakness in the aggregate related to reassessing policies and procedures to determine their continued relevance as impacted by complex transactions and processes 

deficiencies that contributed to the aggregation included 

 

as a result we have concluded that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to our financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis and therefore we concluded that the aggregation of these deficiencies represents a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of march 31 2020 

remediation plan 

our remediation efforts are ongoing management continues to implement remediation actions to address the specific control deficiencies that in the aggregate led to a material weakness additionally management has completed a detailed root cause analysis which was designed to identify areas of focus where enhancements can be made to the internal control environment to support the continued timely reassessment of policies and procedures and reduce the occurrence of future deficiencies caused by complex transactions and processes management has remediated certain of the identified control deficiencies that lead to the material weakness 

the following activities are designed as part of this remediation plan 

 

management continues to be actively engaged to take steps to remediate the material weakness noted above including 1 appointment of an external advisor to lead the remediation activities 2 hiring a new global sox director reporting to the chief risk officer and 3 establishment of progress reporting to the audit committee  while we have made significant progress there has not been sufficient time to resolve the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting 

as we continue to improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we may supplement our remediation activities as our work progresses where appropriate our goal is to have enhanced control policies procedures processes in place as promptly as practicable however due to the nature of the work and subsequent testing required to conclude that a material weakness no longer exists we are not in a position to complete our remediation plan and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is not designed or operating effectively as of march 31 2020 

the effectiveness of dxcs internal control over financial reporting as of march 31 2020 has been audited by deloitte  touche llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report appearing on page 147 of this annual report 

changes in internal controls over financial reporting 

our management has evaluated with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f of the exchange act during the fourth quarter of 2020 as a result of the global covid19 pandemic in march certain employees of the company began working remotely as a result of these changes to the working environment the company has not identified any material changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting the company is continually monitoring and assessing the covid19 situation to determine any potential impacts on the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting  other than the remediation efforts described above which were ongoing during the last fiscal quarter ended march 31 2020 there were no other changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to rules 13a15f and 15d15f of the exchange act that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting

for a discussion of risks associated with our foreign operations see part i item 1a risk factors of this annual report 

seasonality 

general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results the markets in which we sell our products services and solutions occasionally experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales we also experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our services for example contract awards are often tied to the timing of our clients fiscal yearends and we also experience seasonality related to our own fiscal yearend selling activities 

competition 

the it and professional services markets in which we compete are highly competitive and are not dominated by a single company or a small number of companies a substantial number of companies offer services that overlap and are competitive with those we offer in addition the increased importance of offshore labor centers has brought several foreignbased firms into competition with us 

our competitors include 

 

the principal methods of competition in the markets for our solutions and services include 

 

our ability to obtain new business and retain existing business is dependent upon the following 

 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of trade secrets patents copyrights and trademarks as well as contractual protections to protect our business interests while our technical services and products are not generally dependent upon patent protection we do selectively seek patent protection for certain inventions likely to be incorporated into products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position 

as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms of the individual patents across the patent portfolio vary we believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our solutions and services and enhancing our freedom of action to sell solutions and services in markets in which we choose to participate no single patent is in itself essential to our company as a whole or to any business segment 

additionally we own or have rights to various trademarks logos service marks and trade names that are used in the operation of our business we also own or have the rights to copyrights that protect the content of our products and other proprietary materials 

in addition to developing our intellectual property portfolio we license intellectual property rights from third parties as we deem appropriate we have also granted and plan to continue to grant to others licenses under our intellectual property rights when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest these license arrangements include a number of crosslicenses with third parties 

environmental regulation 

our operations are subject to regulation under various federal state local and foreign laws concerning the environment including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites environmental costs and accruals are presently not material to our operations cash flows or financial position and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities however we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and thirdparty damage or personal injury claims if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if new environmental legislation is passed which impacts our business 

employees 

as of march 31 2018  we employed approximately 150000  employees and had offices and operations in 70  countries

risk factors 

tableend 

any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this annual report in such case the trading price for dxc common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment the risks described below are not the only risks that dxc currently faces additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently expected to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations or the price of our common stock in the future past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

risks relating to our business 

achieving our growth objectives may prove unsuccessful we may be unable to identify future attractive acquisitions and strategic partnerships which may adversely affect our growth in addition if we are unable to integrate acquisitions and implement strategic partnerships or achieve anticipated revenue improvements and cost reductions our profitability may be materially and adversely affected 

we may fail to complete strategic transactions closing strategic transactions is subject to uncertainties and risks including the risk that we will be unable to satisfy conditions to closing such as regulatory and financing conditions and the absence of material adverse changes to our business in addition our inability to successfully integrate the operations we acquire and leverage these operations to generate substantial cost savings as well as our inability to avoid revenue erosion and earnings decline could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial position in order to achieve successful acquisitions we will need to 

 

we may not be successful in meeting these challenges or any others encountered in connection with historical and future acquisitions in addition the anticipated benefits of one or more acquisitions may not be realized and future acquisitions could require dilutive issuances of equity securities andor the assumption of contingent liabilities the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have also entered into and intend to identify and enter into additional strategic partnerships with other industry participants that will allow us to expand our business however we may be unable to identify attractive strategic partnership candidates or complete these partnerships on terms favorable to us in addition if we are unable to successfully implement our partnership strategies or our strategic partners do not fulfill their obligations or otherwise prove disadvantageous to our business our investments in these partnerships and our anticipated business expansion could be adversely affected 

our ability to continue to develop and expand our service offerings to address emerging business demands and technological trends including the demand for digital technologies and services may impact our future growth if we are not successful in meeting these business challenges our results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected 

our ability to implement solutions for our customers incorporating new developments and improvements in technology that translate into productivity improvements for our customers and our ability to develop digital and other new service offerings that meet current and prospective customers needs as well as evolving industry standards are critical to our success the markets we serve are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change our competitors may develop solutions or services that make our offerings obsolete our ability to develop and implement up to date solutions utilizing new technologies that meet evolving customer needs in cloud information technology outsourcing consulting industry software and solutions and application services markets in a timely or costeffective manner will impact our ability to retain and attract customers and our future revenue growth and earnings 

our ability to compete in certain markets we serve is dependent on our ability to continue to expand our capacity in certain offshore locations however as our presence in these locations increases we are exposed to risks inherent to these locations which may adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

a significant portion of our application outsourcing and software development activities has been shifted to india and we plan to continue to expand our presence there and in other lower cost locations as a result we are exposed to the risks inherent in operating in india or other locations including 1 a highly competitive labor market for skilled workers which may result in significant increases in labor costs as well as shortages of qualified workers in the future and 2 the possibility that the us federal government or the european union may enact legislation that provides significant disincentives for customers to locate certain of their operations offshore which would reduce the demand for the services we provide in such locations and may adversely impact our cost structure and profitability in addition india has experienced and other countries may experience political instability civil unrest and hostilities with neighboring countries negative or uncertain political climates in countries or locations where we operate including but not limited to military activity or civil hostilities criminal activities and other acts of violence infrastructure disruption natural disasters or other conditions could adversely affect our operations 

we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended fcpa and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions we pursue opportunities in certain parts of the world that experience government corruption and in certain circumstances compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices our internal policies mandate compliance with all applicable antibribery laws we require our employees partners subcontractors agents and others to comply with the fcpa and other antibribery laws there is no assurance that our policies or procedures will protect us against liability under the fcpa or other laws for actions taken by our employees and intermediaries if we are found to be liable for fcpa violations either due to our own acts or our omissions or due to the acts or omissions of others we could suffer from severe criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations or cash flows in addition detecting investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of the fcpa or other antibribery violations is expensive and could consume significant time and attention of our senior management 

we could be held liable for damages our reputation could suffer or we may experience service interruptions from security breaches cyber attacks or disclosure of confidential information or personal data which could cause significant financial loss 

as a provider of it services to private and public sector customers operating in a number of regulated industries and countries we store and process increasingly large amounts of data for our clients including sensitive and personally identifiable information we also manage it infrastructure of our own and of clients we possess substantial intellectual property and we collect and store certain personal and financial information from customers and employees 

at the same time the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches and cyberattacks provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information and corporate security cybersecurity incidents can result from unintentional events or deliberate attacks by insiders or third parties including criminals competitors nationstates and hacktivists like other companies we face an evolving array of cybersecurity and data security threats that pose risks to the company and our clients we can also be harmed by attacks on third parties such as denialofservice attacks we see regular unauthorized attempts to access our systems which we evaluate for severity and frequency some of those attempts may succeed it is possible that we could suffer a severe attack or incident with serious impacts on the company 

we must expend capital and other resources to protect against attempted security breaches or cyberattacks or to alleviate problems caused by successful breaches or attacks we have a robust information security program and are undertaking cybersecurity planning and activities throughout the company this includes the acquisition of technology and services review and refinement of cybersecurity and data security policies and procedures and employee training among many other investments senior management and the board of directors are appropriately and actively engaged in cybersecurity risk management by the company 

our security measures are designed to identify and protect against security breaches and cyberattacks no threat incident identified to date has resulted in a material adverse effect on us or our customers however there is no perfect security system and our failure to detect prevent or adequately respond to a future threat incident could subject us to liability and reputational damage and have a material adverse effect on our business in addition the cost and operational consequences of responding to breaches and cyberattacks and implementing remediation measures could be significant 

  

we rely on internal and external information and technological systems to manage our operations and are exposed to risk of loss resulting from breaches in the security or other failures of these systems security breaches or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our clients or our customers could expose us to risk of loss of this information regulatory scrutiny actions and penalties extensive contractual liability and other litigation reputational harm and a loss of customer confidence which could potentially have an adverse impact on future business with current and potential customers 

advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments may result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms that we use to protect our data and that of clients including sensitive customer transaction data a party who is able to circumvent our security measures and those of our contractors partners and vendors could misappropriate proprietary information confidential data of us or our customers employees and business partners or cause interruption in our or their operations 

experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy ransomware malware and other malicious software programs through phishing and other methods that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of these products in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications produced or procured from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the security and operation of our systems or harm those of third parties with whom we may interact the costs to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems including ransomware malware bugs malicious software programs and other security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers which may impede our sales distribution or other critical functions 

increasing cybersecurity data privacy and information security obligations around the world could also impose additional regulatory pressures on our customers’ businesses and indirectly on our operations or lead to inquiries or enforcement actions in the united states we are seeing increasing obligations and expectations from federal and nonfederal customers in response some of our customers have sought and may continue to seek to contractually impose certain strict data privacy and information security obligations on us some of our customer contracts may not limit our liability for the loss of confidential information if we are unable to adequately address these concerns our business and results of operations could suffer 

compliance with new privacy and security laws requirements and regulations such as the european union general data protection regulation which became effective in may 2018 where required or undertaken by us may result in cost increases due to expanded compliance obligations potential systems changes the development of additional administrative processes and increased enforcement actions fines and penalties while we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations as well as internal privacy policies any failure or perceived failure to comply or any misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information may result in proceedings or actions against us by government or other entities private lawsuits against us including class actions or the loss of customers which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations 

portions of our infrastructure also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming disruptive and resource intensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could reduce our revenues increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

our ability to raise additional capital for future needs may impact our ability to compete 

we currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with moodys investors service fitch rating services and 

standard  poors ratings services our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time rating agencies may review the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control including potential new standards requiring the agencies to reassess rating practices and methodologies if changes in our credit ratings were to occur it could result in higher interest costs under certain of our credit facilities it would also cause our future borrowing costs to increase and limit our access to capital markets any downgrades could negatively impact the perception of our company by lenders and other third parties in addition certain of our major contracts provide customers with a right of termination in certain circumstances in the event of a rating downgrade below investment grade 

information regarding our credit ratings is included in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k under the caption liquidity and capital resources 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness totaling approximately 84 billion  as of march 31 2018  including capital lease obligations we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future for many reasons including to fund acquisitions our existing indebtedness together with the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the restrictive covenants contained in or expected to be contained in the documents evidencing such indebtedness may among other things 

 acquisitions or other general business purposes; 

 agreements governing our debt instruments which could require us to negotiate a waiver or could 

cause us to incur additional fees and expenses 

 indebtedness and could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

 and limit the future availability for debt financing and 

 

in addition we could be unable to refinance our outstanding indebtedness on reasonable terms or at all 

our primary markets are highly competitive if we are unable to compete in these highly competitive markets our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

our competitors include large technically competent and well capitalized companies some of which have emerged as a result of industry consolidation as well as “pureplay” companies that have a single product focus this competition may place downward pressure on operating margins in our industry particularly for technology outsourcing contract extensions or renewals as a result we may not be able to maintain our current operating margins or achieve favorable operating margins for technology outsourcing contracts extended or renewed in the future if we fail to effectively reduce our cost structure during periods with declining margins our results of operations may be adversely affected 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors our competitiveness is based on factors including technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation range of products and services account relationships customer training service and support and security if we are unable to compete based on such factors our results of operations and business prospects could be harmed we have a large portfolio of services and we need to allocate financial personnel and other resources across all services while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of our service lines as a result we may invest less in certain business areas than our competitors do and competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available to them compared to the resources allocated to our services industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate additionally competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with existing or potential customers or suppliers 

companies with whom we have alliances in certain areas may be or become competitors in other areas in addition companies with whom we have alliances also may acquire or form alliances with competitors which could reduce their business with us if we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with alliance partners our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we face aggressive price competition and may have to lower prices to stay competitive while simultaneously seeking to maintain or improve revenue and gross margin in addition competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lowercost markets in which we compete or who can obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer our cash flows results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressures 

the terms of the separation and distribution agreement in connection with the hpes merger included noncompetition provisions pursuant to which dxc and hpe generally agreed not to compete in certain product and service categories for two years in addition hpe is party to a separation and distribution agreement with hp that restricts hpe and the hpes business from engaging in certain activities that compete with hp until october 31 2018 the foregoing restrictions may limit our ability to engage in certain activities may potentially lead to disputes and may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to accurately estimate the cost of services and the timeline for completion of contracts the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected 

our commercial contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis our bids are based upon among other items the expected cost to provide the services we generally provide services under time and materials contracts unit price contracts fixedprice contracts and multipleelement software sales we are dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects and the marketplace and to generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services required by the contract and to complete the contracts in a timely manner we face a number of risks when pricing our contracts as many of our projects entail the coordination of operations and workforces in multiple locations and utilizing workforces with different skill sets and competencies across geographically diverse service locations in addition revenues from some of our contracts are recognized using the percentageofcompletion method which requires estimates of total costs at completion fees earned on the contract or both this estimation process particularly due to the technical nature of the services being performed and the longterm nature of certain contracts is complex and involves significant judgment adjustments to original estimates are 

often required as work progresses experience is gained and additional information becomes known even though the scope of the work required under the contract may not change if we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected 

some it outsourcing services agreements contain pricing provisions that permit a client to request a benchmark study by a mutually acceptable third party the benchmarking process typically compares the contractual price of services against the price of similar services offered by other specified providers in a peer comparison group subject to agreed­upon adjustment and normalization factors generally if the benchmarking study shows that the pricing differs from the peer group outside a specified range and the difference is not due to the unique requirements of the client then the parties will negotiate in good faith appropriate adjustments to the pricing this may result in the reduction of rates for the benchmarked services performed after the implementation of those pricing adjustments which could harm the financial performance of our services business 

some it service agreements require significant investment in the early stages that is expected to be recovered through billings over the life of the agreement these agreements often involve the construction of new it systems and communications networks and the development and deployment of new technologies substantial performance risk exists in each agreement with these characteristics and some or all elements of service delivery under these agreements are dependent upon successful completion of the development construction and deployment phases failure to perform satisfactorily under these agreements may expose us to legal liability result in the loss of customers or harm our reputation which could harm the financial performance of our it services business 

performance under contracts including those on which we have partnered with third parties may be adversely affected if we or the third parties fail to deliver on commitments or if we incur legal liability in connection with providing our services and solutions 

our contracts are complex and in some instances may require that we partner with other parties including software and hardware vendors to provide the complex solutions required by our customers our ability to deliver the solutions and provide the services required by our customers is dependent on our and our partners ability to meet our customers delivery schedules if we or our partners fail to deliver services or products on time our ability to complete the contract may be adversely affected additionally our customers may perform audits or require us to perform audits and provide audit reports with respect to the controls and procedures that we use in the performance of services for such customers our ability to acquire new customers and retain existing customers may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed if we receive a qualified opinion or if we cannot obtain an unqualified opinion in a timely manner with respect to our controls and procedures in connection with any such audit we could also incur liability if our controls and procedures or the controls and procedures we manage for a customer were to result in an internal control failure or impair our customer’s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements if we or our partners fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise breach obligations to our customers we could be subject to legal liability which may have a material and adverse impact on our revenues and profitability 

our ability to provide customers with competitive services is dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 

our ability to grow and provide our customers with competitive services is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly motivated people with the skills necessary to serve our customers the markets we serve are highly competitive and competition for skilled employees in the technology outsourcing consulting and systems integration and enterprise services markets is intense for both onshore and offshore locales the loss of personnel could impair our ability to perform under certain contracts which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we also must manage leadership development and succession planning throughout our business the loss of our key personnel coupled with an inability to adequately develop and train personnel and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could have a material adverse effect on relationships with third parties our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition due to the hpes merger uncertainty around future employment opportunities facility locations organizational and reporting structures and other related concerns may impair our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel if employee attrition is higher than expected due to difficulties encountered in the integration process it may adversely impact our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the hpes merger 

if we do not hire train motivate and effectively utilize employees with the right mix of skills and experience in the right geographic regions and for the right offerings to meet the needs of our clients our financial performance could suffer for example if our employee utilization rate is too low our profitability and the level of engagement of our employees could decrease if that utilization rate is too high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition and the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects if we are unable to hire and retain enough employees with the skills or backgrounds needed to meet current demand we may need to redeploy existing personnel increase our reliance on subcontractors or increase employee compensation levels all of which could also negatively affect our profitability in addition if we have more employees than necessary with certain skill sets or in certain geographies we may incur increased costs as we work to rebalance our supply of skills and resources with client demand in those geographies 

  

our international operations are exposed to risks including fluctuations in exchange rates which may be beyond our control 

our exposure to currencies other than the us dollar may impact our results as they are expressed in us dollars currency variations also contribute to variations in sales of products and services in affected jurisdictions for example in the event that one or more european countries were to replace the euro with another currency sales in that country or in europe generally may be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established while historically we have partially mitigated currency risk including exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates by matching costs with revenues in a given currency our exposure to fluctuations in other currencies against the us dollar increases as revenue in currencies other than the us dollar increase and as more of the services we provide are shifted to lower cost regions of the world approximately 56  of revenues earned during fiscal 2018 were derived from sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and are expected to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues also we believe that our ability to match revenues and expenses in a given currency will decrease as more work is performed at offshore locations 

we may use forward and option contracts to protect against currency exchange rate risks the effectiveness of these hedges will depend on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which may be particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand and highly volatile exchange rates we may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and currency variations in addition certain or all of our hedging activities may be ineffective may expire and not be renewed or may not offset the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations losses associated with hedging activities may also impact our revenues and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial condition 

in june 2016 the united kingdom held a referendum in which british citizens voted to exit from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” in march 2017 the uk government initiated a process to withdraw from the european union and began negotiating the terms of its separation current uncertainty over the negotiations between the united kingdom and the european union may adversely affect our operations and financial results risks we associate with brexit include for example that brexit could potentially result in restrictions on the movement of capital and the mobility of personnel between the remaining 27 european union states and the united kingdom in addition to volatility in currency exchange rates brexit also creates uncertainty in areas currently regulated by european union law such as cross border data transfers brexit is also expected to lead to short and mediumterm uncertainty in future trade arrangements between ukbased operations and the various european union markets that they serve 

our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors including 

 

our business operations are subject to various and changing federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we operate in approximately 70  countries in an increasingly complex regulatory environment among other things we provide complex industry specific insurance processing in the united kingdom which is regulated by authorities in the united kingdom and elsewhere such as the uk’s financial conduct authority and her majesty’s treasury and the us department of treasury which increases our exposure to compliance risk for example in february 2017 csc submitted an initial notification of voluntary disclosure to the us department of treasurys office of foreign assets control “ofac” regarding certain possible violations of us sanctions laws pertaining to insurance premium data and claims data processed by two partiallyowned joint ventures of xchanging which csc acquired during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 a copy of the disclosure was also provided to her majesty’s treasury office of financial sanctions implementation in the united kingdom our related internal investigation is continuing and we have undertaken to cooperate with and provide a full report of our findings to ofac when completed our retail investment account management business in germany is another example of a regulated business which must maintain a banking license is regulated by the german federal financial supervisory authority and the european central bank and must comply with german banking laws and regulations 

in addition businesses in the countries in which we operate are subject to local legal and political environments and regulations including with respect to employment tax statutory supervision and reporting and trade restriction these regulations and environments are also subject to change 

adjusting business operations to changing environments and regulations may be costly and could potentially render the particular business operations uneconomical which may adversely affect our profitability or lead to a change in the business operations notwithstanding our best efforts we may not be in compliance with all regulations in the countries in which we operate at all times and may be subject to sanctions penalties or fines as a result these sanctions penalties or fines may materially and adversely impact our profitability 

we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plans and our restructuring may adversely affect our business 

our board of directors has approved several restructuring plans to realign our cost structure due to the changing nature of our business and to achieve operating efficiencies to reduce our costs we may not be able to obtain the costs savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring plans additionally as a result of our restructuring we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge andor inefficiency during transitional periods reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees time and focus which may divert attention from operating and growing our business if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for more information about our restructuring plans see note 19    restructuring costs  

in the course of providing services to customers we may inadvertently infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and be exposed to claims for damages 

the solutions we provide to our customers may inadvertently infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties resulting in claims for damages against us or our customers our contracts generally indemnify our clients from claims for intellectual property infringement for the services and equipment we provide under the applicable contracts we also indemnify certain vendors and customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use by such vendors and customers of software products and services and certain other matters some of the applicable indemnification arrangements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses the expense and time of defending against these claims may have a material and adverse impact on our profitability if we lose our ability to continue using any such services and solutions because they are found to infringe the rights of others we will need to obtain substitute solutions or seek alternative means of obtaining the technology necessary to continue to provide such services and solutions our inability to replace such solutions or to replace such solutions in a timely or costeffective manner could materially adversely affect our results of operations additionally the publicity resulting from infringing intellectual property rights may damage our reputation and adversely impact our ability to develop new business 

we may be exposed to negative publicity and other potential risks if we are unable to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting   

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the related regulations require our management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud however a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met there can be no assurance that all control issues or fraud will be detected in connection with the hpes merger and as we continue to grow our business our internal controls continue to become more complex and require more resources 

  

any failure to maintain effective controls could prevent us from timely and reliably reporting financial results and may harm our operating results in addition if we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of each fiscal year end we may be exposed to negative publicity which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information any failure to maintain effective internal controls and any such resulting negative publicity may negatively affect our business and stock price 

additionally the existence of any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies would require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a timely manner the existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause stockholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information all of which could materially and adversely affect us and the market price of our common stock 

  

we could suffer additional losses due to asset impairment charges 

we acquired a substantial quantity of goodwill and other intangibles as a result of the hpes merger increasing our exposure to this risk we test our goodwill for impairment during the second quarter of every year and on an interim date should events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount if the fair value of a reporting unit is revised downward due to declines in business performance or other factors an impairment could result and a noncash charge could be required we test intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable this assessment of the recoverability of finitelived intangible assets could result in an impairment and a noncash charge could be required 

we also test certain equipment and deferred cost balances associated with contracts when the contract is materially underperforming or is expected to materially underperform in the future as compared to the original bid model or budget if the projected cash flows of a particular contract are not adequate to recover the unamortized cost balance of the asset group the balance is adjusted in the tested period based on the contracts fair value either of these impairments could materially affect our reported net earnings 

we may not be able to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock in accordance with our announced intent or at all 

on april 3 2017 we announced the establishment of a share repurchase plan approved by the board of directors with an initial authorization of up to 20 billion for future repurchases of outstanding shares of our common stock likewise during fiscal 2018 we paid quarterly cash dividends to our stockholders in accordance with our announced dividend policy for fiscal 2018 we intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend during fiscal 2019 but the declaration and payment of future dividends the amount of any such dividends and the establishment of record and payment dates for dividends if any are subject to final determination by our board of directors after review of our current strategy and financial performance and position among other things 

the board of directors’ determinations regarding dividends and share repurchases will depend on a variety of factors including net income cash flow generated from operations amount and location of our cash and investment balances overall liquidity position and potential alternative uses of cash such as acquisitions as well as economic conditions and expected future financial results there can be no guarantee that we will achieve our financial goals in the amounts or within the expected time frame or at all our ability to declare future dividends will depend on our future financial performance which in turn depends on the successful implementation of our strategy and on financial competitive regulatory and other factors general economic conditions demand and prices for our services and other factors specific to our industry or specific projects many of which are beyond our control therefore our ability to generate cash flow depends on the performance of our operations and could be limited by decreases in our profitability or increases in costs regulatory changes capital expenditures or debt servicing requirements 

any failure to achieve our financial goals could negatively impact our reputation harm investor confidence in us and cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

we are defendants in pending litigation that may have a material and adverse impact on our profitability and liquidity 

as noted in note 20    commitments and contingencies  we are currently party to a number of disputes that involve or may involve litigation we are not able to predict the ultimate outcome of these disputes or the actual 

impact of these matters on our profitability if we agree to settle these matters or judgments are secured against us we may incur liabilities that may have a material and adverse impact on our liquidity and earnings 

we may be adversely affected by disruptions in the credit markets including disruptions that reduce our customers access to credit and increase the costs to our customers of obtaining credit 

the credit markets have historically been volatile and therefore it is not possible to predict the ability of our clients and customers to access shortterm financing and other forms of capital if a disruption in the credit markets were to occur it could pose a risk to our business if customers or suppliers are unable to obtain financing to meet payment or delivery obligations to us in addition customers may decide to downsize defer or cancel contracts which could negatively affect our revenues 

further as of march 31 2018 we have 36 billion  of floating rate debt of which a portion has been swapped to fixed rate debt accordingly a spike in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

our hedging program is subject to counterparty default risk 

we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts and interest rate swaps with a number of counterparties as a result we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these contracts defaults on its performance under the contract during an economic downturn the counterpartys financial condition may deteriorate rapidly and with little notice and we may be unable to take action to protect our exposure in the event of a counterparty default we could incur significant losses which may harm our business and financial condition in the event that one or more of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy our ability to eventually recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterpartys default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty 

we derive significant revenues and profit from contracts awarded through competitive bidding processes which can impose substantial costs on us and we may not achieve revenue and profit objectives if we fail to bid on these projects effectively 

we derive significant revenues and profit from government contracts that are awarded through competitive bidding processes we expect that most of the nonus government business we seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through competitive bidding competitive bidding is expensive and presents a number of risks including 

 

if our customers experience financial difficulties we may not be able to collect our receivables which would materially and adversely affect our profitability 

over the course of a longterm contract a customers financial condition may decline and lower its ability to pay its obligations this would cause our cash collections to decrease and bad debt expense to increase while we may resort to alternative methods to pursue claims or collect receivables these methods are expensive and time consuming and successful collection is not guaranteed failure to collect our receivables or prevail on claims would have an adverse effect on our profitability and cash flows 

failure to comply with customer contracts or government contracting regulations or requirements could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

contracts with customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements in particular our contracts with federal state provincial and local governmental customers are generally subject to various procurement regulations contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance including the maintenance of necessary security clearances contracts with us government agencies are also subject to audits and investigations which may include a review of performance on contracts pricing practices cost structure and compliance with applicable laws and regulations 

any failure on our part to comply with the specific provisions in customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations or other requirements could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments and in the case of government contracts fines and suspension from future government contracting such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business in addition we may be subject to qui tam  litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to government contracts which could include claims for treble damages further any negative publicity with respect to customer contracts or any related proceedings regardless of accuracy may damage our business by harming our ability to compete for new contracts 

contracts with the us federal government and related agencies are also subject to issues with respect to federal budgetary and spending limits or matters any changes to the fiscal policies of the us federal government may decrease overall government funding result in delays in the procurement of products and services due to lack of funding cause the us federal government and government agencies to reduce their purchases under existing contracts or cause them to exercise their rights to terminate contracts at­ will or to abstain from exercising options to renew contracts any of which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows 

if our customer contracts are terminated if we are suspended or disbarred from government work or our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our financial performance could suffer 

recent us tax legislation may materially affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

recently enacted us tax legislation has significantly changed the us federal income taxation of us corporations including by reducing the us corporate income tax rate limiting interest deductions permitting immediate expensing of certain capital expenditures adopting elements of a territorial tax system imposing a onetime transition tax or “repatriation tax” on all undistributed earnings and profits of certain usowned foreign corporations revising the rules governing net operating losses and the rules governing foreign tax credits and introducing new antibase erosion provisions many of these changes are effective immediately without any transition periods or grandfathering for existing transactions the legislation is unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the us department of the treasury and internal revenue service irs any of which could lessen or increase certain impacts of the legislation in addition it is unclear how these us federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities 

while our analysis and interpretation of this legislation is ongoing based on our current evaluation we recorded a provisional reduction of our deferred income tax liabilities resulting in a material noncash benefit to earnings during fiscal 2018 the period in which the tax legislation was enacted which may be subject to further adjustment in subsequent periods throughout fiscal 2019 in accordance with recent interpretive guidance issued by the sec additionally the repatriation tax resulted in a material amount of additional us tax liability the amount of which is reflected as tax expense in fiscal 2018 when the tax legislation was enacted despite the fact that the resulting tax may be paid over eight years further there may be other material adverse effects resulting from the legislation that we have not yet identified 

while some of the changes made by the tax legislation may adversely affect the company in one or more reporting periods and prospectively other changes may be beneficial on a going forward basis we continue to 

work with our tax advisors to determine the full impact that the recent tax legislation as a whole will have on us we urge our investors to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to such legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in our securities 

changes in our tax rates could affect our future results 

our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

risks related to the hpes merger 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits from the hpes merger 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to realize the intended benefits of the hpes merger or that we will perform as anticipated specifically the hpes merger could cause disruptions in the combined companys business including by disrupting operations or causing customers to delay or to defer decisions to purchase products or renew contracts or to end their relationships similarly it is possible that current or prospective employees could experience uncertainty about their future roles which could harm our ability to attract and retain key personnel 

our success in realizing cost and revenues synergies growth opportunities and other financial and operating benefits as a result of the hpes merger and the timing of this realization depends on the successful integration of our business operations even if we successfully integrate we cannot predict with certainty if or when these cost and revenue synergies growth opportunities and benefits will occur or the extent to which they actually will be achieved for example the benefits from the hpes merger may be offset by costs incurred in integrating csc and hpes or in required capital expenditures related to the business combination with hpes in addition the quantification of previously announced synergies expected to result from the hpes merger is based on significant estimates and assumptions that are subjective in nature and inherently uncertain realization of any benefits and synergies could be affected by a number of factors beyond our control including without limitation general economic conditions increased operating costs regulatory developments and other risks the amount of synergies actually realized if any and the time periods in which any such synergies are realized could differ materially from the expected synergies regardless of whether the two business operations are combined successfully if the integration is unsuccessful or if we are unable to realize the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the hpes merger there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business and financial performance could suffer if we do not manage properly the risks associated with the hpes merger 

the hpes business relies on its ability to retain significant services clients and maintain or increase the level of revenues from these clients before the hpes merger hpes was in the process of addressing challenges relating to the market shift to cloudrelated it infrastructure software and services hpes was experiencing commoditization in the it infrastructure services business market that is placing pressure on traditional information technology outsourcing pricing and cost structures there is also an industrywide shift to highly automated assetlight delivery of it infrastructure and applications leading to headcount consolidation to be successful in addressing these challenges our integration of hpes must continue executing on the hpes multiyear turnaround plan which includes a cost reduction initiative to align its costs with its revenue trajectory a focus on new logo wins and strategic enterprise services and initiatives to improve execution in sales performance and accountability contracting practices and pricing if we do not succeed in these efforts or if these efforts are more costly or time consuming than expected the hpes business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

our results may be negatively affected if we are unable to adequately replace or provide resources formerly provided by hpe or replace them at the same or lower cost 

hpes has historically received benefits and services from hpe while hpe agreed to provide certain transition services to us for a period following the hpes merger it cannot be assured that we will be able to adequately replace or provide resources formerly provided by hpe or replace them at the same or lower cost if we are not able to replace the resources provided by hpe or are unable to replace them without incurring significant additional costs or are delayed in replacing the resources provided by hpe or if the potential customers or other partners of the hpes business do not view our business relationships as equivalent to hpe’s our results of operations may be harmed 

in connection with the hpes merger hpe and dxc and in some cases csc entered into several agreements that govern the relationship between the parties going forward including an employee matters agreement a tax matters agreement an intellectual property matters agreement a transition services agreement and a real estate matters agreement changes in the strategic direction of hpe or any successor of hpe could over time impact the positioning and offerings of hpe’s brands and programs including those being made available to us 

the integration following the hpes merger may present significant challenges 

there is a significant degree of difficulty inherent in the process of integrating hpes and csc these difficulties include 

 

the ongoing process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of one or more of our businesses members of senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process which would decrease the time they have to manage our business service existing businesses and develop new services or strategies in addition certain existing contractual restrictions limit the ability to engage in certain integration activities for varying periods after the hpes merger there is no assurance we will be able to continue to manage this integration to the extent or in the time horizon anticipated particularly given the larger scale of the hpes business in comparison to cscs business if senior management is not able to timely and effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business could suffer the delay or inability to achieve anticipated integration goals could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations after the hpes merger 

the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information of csc and hpes is not intended to reflect what actual results of operations would have been had csc and hpes been a combined company for the periods presented and therefore these results may not be indicative of dxcs future operating performance 

the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information presented in this document is for illustrative purposes only and is based in part on certain assumptions regarding the hpes merger that management believes are reasonable 

the business combination involving csc and hpes was a reverse merger acquisition with hpes deemed the legal acquirer in this combination and csc deemed the acquirer for accounting purposes under gaap the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not reflect the costs of any integration activities or transaction­ related costs or incremental capital spend that management believes are necessary to realize the anticipated synergies from the hpes merger accordingly the pro forma financial information included in this document does not reflect what dxc’s results of operations or operating condition would have been had csc and hpes been a consolidated entity during all periods presented or what dxc’s results of operations and financial condition will be in the future 

we could have an indemnification obligation to hpe if the stock distribution in connection with the hpes business separation the distribution were determined not to qualify for taxfree treatment which could materially adversely affect our financial condition 

if due to any of our representations being untrue or our covenants being breached the distribution was determined not to qualify for taxfree treatment under section 355 of the internal revenue code the code hpe would generally be subject to tax as if it sold the dxc common stock in a taxable transaction which could result in a material tax liability in addition each hpe stockholder who received dxc common stock in the distribution would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the dxc common stock received by the stockholder in the distribution 

in addition the distribution would be taxable to hpe but not to hpe stockholders pursuant to section 355e of the code if one or more persons acquire a 50 or greater interest measured by vote or value in the stock of hpe or us directly or indirectly including through acquisitions of our stock after the hpes merger as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution in addition section 355e of the code generally creates a presumption that any direct or indirect acquisition of stock of hpe or us within two years before or after the distribution is part of a plan that includes the distribution although the parties may be able to rebut that presumption in certain circumstances the process for determining whether an acquisition is part of a plan under these rules is complex inherently factual in nature and subject to a comprehensive analysis of the facts and circumstances of the particular case if the irs were to determine that direct or indirect acquisitions of stock of hpe or us either before or after the distribution were part of a plan that includes the distribution such determination could cause section 355e of the code to apply to the distribution which could result in a material tax liability 

under the tax matters agreement we were required to indemnify hpe against taxes resulting from the distribution or certain aspects of the hpes merger arising as a result of an everett tainting act as defined in the tax matters agreement if we were required to indemnify hpe for taxes resulting from an everett tainting act that indemnification obligation would likely be substantial and could materially adversely affect our financial condition 

to address compliance with section 355e of the code in the tax matters agreement we agreed to certain restrictions that may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or engage in other transactions including stock issuances certain asset dispositions mergers consolidations and other strategic transactions for a period of time following the hpes merger as a result we may determine to forgo certain transactions that otherwise could be advantageous 

if the hpes merger does not qualify as a reorganization under section 368a of the code cscs former stockholders may incur significant tax liabilities 

the completion of the hpes merger was conditioned upon the receipt by hpe and csc of opinions of counsel to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the hpes merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368a of the code the hpes merger tax opinions the parties did not seek a ruling from the irs regarding such qualification the hpes merger tax opinions were based on current law and relied upon various factual representations and assumptions as well as certain undertakings made by hpe hpes and csc if any of those representations or assumptions is untrue or incomplete in any material respect or any of those undertakings is not complied with or if the facts upon which the hpes merger tax opinions are based are materially different from the actual facts that existed at the time of the hpes merger the conclusions reached in the hpes merger tax opinions could be adversely affected and the hpes merger may not qualify for taxfree treatment opinions of counsel are not binding on the irs or the courts no assurance can be given that the irs will not challenge the conclusions set forth in the hpes merger tax opinions or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the hpes merger were determined to be taxable previous holders of csc common stock would be considered to have made a taxable disposition of their shares to hpes and such stockholders would generally recognize taxable gain or loss on their receipt of hpes common stock in the hpes merger 

we assumed certain material pension benefit obligations in connection with the hpes merger these liabilities and the related future funding obligations could restrict our cash available for operations capital expenditures and other requirements and may materially adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity 

pursuant to the employee matters agreement entered into in connection with the hpes merger while hpe retained all us defined benefit pension plan liabilities dxc retained all liabilities relating to the international retirement guarantee “irg” programs for all hpes employees the irg is a nonqualified retirement plan for employees who transfer internationally at the request of the hpe group the irg determines the country of guarantee which is generally the country in which an employee has spent the longest portion of his or her career with the hpe group and the present value of a full career benefit for the employee under the hpe defined benefit pension plan and social security or social insurance system in the country of guarantee the irg then offsets the present value of the retirement benefits from plans and social insurance systems in the countries in which the employee earned retirement benefits for his or her total period of hpe group employment the net benefit value is payable as a single sum as soon as practicable after termination or retirement this liability could restrict cash available for our operations capital expenditures and other requirements and may materially affect our financial condition and liquidity 

in addition pursuant to the employee matters agreement dxc assumed certain other defined benefit pension liabilities in a number of nonus countries including the united kingdom germany and switzerland unless otherwise agreed or required by local law where a defined benefit pension plan was maintained solely by a member of the hpes business dxc assumed all assets and liabilities arising out of those nonus defined benefit pension plans and where a defined benefit pension plan was not maintained solely by a member of the hpes business dxc assumed all assets and liabilities for those eligible hpes employees in connection with the hpes merger these liabilities and the related future payment obligations could restrict cash available for our operations capital expenditures and other requirements and may materially affect our financial condition and liquidity 

risks related to the proposed usps separation and mergers 

the proposed usps separation and mergers are contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions and the usps separation and mergers may not be consummated on the terms or timeline currently contemplated 

on october 11 2017 our board of directors unanimously approved a plan to spin off our usps business and combine it with vencore and keypoint to form a separate independent publicly traded company named perspecta inc perspecta to serve us public sector clients 

as previously announced aspects of the proposed usps separation and mergers are expected to include 1 the transfer by dxc of certain subsidiary entities holding our usps business to perspecta the “usps reorganization” 2 the receipt by dxc of cash andor perspecta debt securities in an aggregate amount of 984 million which reflects the transaction consideration of 105 billion less 66 million in principal amount of debt that will remain outstanding at a subsidiary of perspecta as part of the usps reorganization the “distribution consideration” 3 the distribution by dxc to its stockholders of all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock par value 001 per share of perspecta by way of a pro rata dividend the “distribution” and together with the usps reorganization the “usps separation” and 4 the acquisition of vencore and keypoint by perspecta in exchange for perspecta common shares and approximately 400 million of cash merger consideration the “mergers” upon consummation of the usps separation and mergers dxc shareholders are expected to own approximately 86 of perspecta’s common shares and funds managed by veritas capital and its affiliates are expected to own approximately 14 of the perspecta’s common shares in addition a subsidiary of perspecta will retain contractual capitalized lease obligations with an aggregate outstanding balance up to 300 million net of cash payments from dxc 

the terms and conditions of the usps separation and mergers are as set forth in the perspecta merger agreement and further to the perspecta merger agreement other separation agreements to be entered into by and between dxc and perspecta prior to completion of the usps separation and mergers the “separation agreements” 

the consummation of the mergers is subject to certain conditions including i the completion of the usps reorganization the payment of the distribution consideration and the completion of the distribution ii the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended which was satisfied on december 22 2017 iii the effectiveness of the registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission which was satisfied on may 2 2018 and the approval for listing on the new york stock exchange or the nasdaq global market of the shares of perspecta common stock to be issued in the distribution which was satisfied on april 30 2018 iv the accuracy of the parties’ representations and warranties and the performance of their respective covenants contained in the perspecta merger agreement and v our receipt of an opinion of tax counsel to the effect that the usps separation should qualify as a taxfree transaction for us federal income tax purposes 

additionally the perspecta merger agreement contains certain termination rights for dxc vencore and keypoint the perspecta merger agreement further provides that if the distribution is not completed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the separation agreements on or before october 1 2018 a termination fee of 50 million may be payable by dxc to vencore and keypoint upon termination of the perspecta merger agreement under specified circumstances 

for these and other reasons the usps separation and mergers may not be completed on the terms or timeline contemplated if at all and we may incur significant costs 

the proposed usps separation and mergers may result in disruptions to relationships with customers and other business partners or may not achieve the intended results 

if we complete the proposed usps separation and mergers there can be no assurance that we will be able to realize the intended benefits of the transactions or that the combined company will perform as anticipated specifically the proposed transactions could cause disruptions in our remaining businesses the usps business and the vencore and keypoint businesses including by disrupting operations or causing customers to delay or to defer decisions or to end their relationships or otherwise limiting the ability to compete for or perform certain contracts or services or other potential effects relating to organizational conflict of interest “oci” issues including action to mitigate or avoid ocis or lost business opportunity if the usps business and the vencore and keypoint businesses face difficulties in integrating their businesses or the vencore and keypoint businesses face difficulties in their businesses generally the usps separation and mergers if completed may not achieve the intended results 

further it is possible that current or prospective employees of the usps business or the vencore and keypoint businesses could experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company which could harm the ability of the usps business or the vencore and keypoint businesses to attract and retain key personnel any of the foregoing could adversely affect our remaining businesses the usps business or the vencore and keypoint businesses the financial condition of such businesses and their results of operations and prospects 

the proposed usps separation and mergers could result in substantial tax liability to dxc and our stockholders 

among the conditions to completing the usps separation and mergers will be our receipt of a legal opinion of tax counsel substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes i the usps separation should qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of section 368a1d of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” ii each of dxc and perspecta should be a “party to a reorganization” within the meaning of section 368b of the code with respect to the usps separation iii the distribution should qualify as 1 a taxfree spinoff resulting in nonrecognition under sections 355a 361 and 368a of the code and 2 a transaction in which the stock distributed thereby should constitute “qualified property” for purposes of sections 355d 355e and 361c of the code and iv none of the mergers should cause section 355e of the code to apply to the distribution 

the opinion of counsel we receive will be based on among other things various factual representations and assumptions as well as certain undertakings made by dxc and perspecta if any of those representations or assumptions is untrue or incomplete in any material respect or any of those undertakings is not complied with the 

conclusions reached in the opinion could be adversely affected and the usps separation may not qualify for taxfree treatment furthermore an opinion of counsel is not binding on the irs or the courts accordingly no assurance can be given that the irs will not challenge the conclusions set forth in the opinion or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if notwithstanding our receipt of the opinion the usps separation is determined to be taxable we would recognize taxable gain as if we had sold the shares of perspecta in a taxable sale for its fair market value which could result in a substantial tax liability in addition if the usps separation is determined to be taxable each holder of our common stock who receives shares of perspecta would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received which could materially increase such holder’s tax liability 

even if the usps separation otherwise qualifies as a taxfree transaction the distribution could be taxable to us but not to our shareholders in certain circumstances if future significant acquisitions of our stock or the stock of perspecta are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution in this event the resulting tax liability could be substantial in connection with the usps separation we expect to enter into a tax matters agreement with perspecta under which it will agree not to undertake any transaction without our consent that could reasonably be expected to cause the usps separation to be taxable to us and to indemnify us for any tax liabilities resulting from such transactions these obligations and potential tax liabilities could be substantial 

risk relating to the nps separation defined below 

the nps separation could result in significant tax liabilities to dxc and former csc stockholders that received csra inc stock in the separation 

prior to the hpes merger csc separated its us public sector business national public sector nps on november 27 2015 the nps separation in connection with the nps separation csc received an opinion of counsel substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the nps separation qualified as a taxfree transaction to csc and holders of csc common stock under section 355 and related provisions of the code if notwithstanding the conclusions expressed in that opinion the nps separation were determined to be taxable csc and csc stockholders that received csra stock in the nps separation could incur significant tax liabilities 

under section 355e of the code the nps separation would generally be taxable to us but not to former csc stockholders if one or more persons acquire a 50 or greater interest measured by vote or value in the stock of csc directly or indirectly including through acquisition of our stock after the completion of the hpes merger as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the nps separation in general an acquisition will be presumed to be part of a plan with the nps separation if the acquisition occurs within two years before or after the nps separation this presumption may however be rebutted based upon an analysis of the facts and circumstances related to the nps separation and the particular acquisition in question 

the completion of the hpes merger was conditioned upon the receipt of csc of an opinion of counsel to the effect that the hpes merger should not cause section 355e of the code to apply to the nps separation or otherwise affect the qualification of the nps separation as a taxfree distribution under section 355 of the code the “separation tax opinion” the separation tax opinion was based on current law and relied upon various factual representations and assumptions as well as certain undertakings made by csc if any of those representations or assumptions is untrue or incomplete in any material respect or any of those undertakings is not complied with or if the facts upon which the separation tax opinion is based are materially different from the actual facts that existed at the time of the hpes merger the conclusions reached in the separation tax opinion could be adversely affected and the separation may not qualify for taxfree treatment no assurance can be given that the irs will not challenge the conclusions set forth in the separation tax opinion or that a court would not sustain such a challenge further in light of the requirements of section 355e of the code we might determine to forgo certain transactions including share repurchases stock issuances certain asset dispositions mergers consolidations and other strategic transactions for some period of time following the hpes merger

results of operations 

in connection with the hpes merger csc was deemed the accounting acquirer of hpes for accounting purposes under gaap therefore csc is considered dxcs predecessor and the historical financial statements of csc prior to april 1 2017 are reflected herein as dxcs historical financial statements accordingly the financial results of dxc as of and for any periods ending prior to april 1 2017 do not include the financial results of hpes and therefore are not directly comparable additionally csc used to report its results based on a fiscal year convention that comprises four thirteenweek quarters however effective april 1 2017 dxcs fiscal year was modified to end on march 31 of each year with each quarter ending on the last calendar day 

in an effort to provide investors with additional information the following discussion includes certain comparisons of our results of operations for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018 to our pro forma results of operations for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017  our pro forma results of operations for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017 are based upon the historical statements of operations of each of csc and hpes giving effect to the hpes merger as if it had been consummated on april 2 2016 csc reported its results based on a fiscal year convention that comprised four thirteenweek quarters hpes reported its results on a fiscal year basis ended october 31 as a consequence of csc and hpes having different fiscal yearend dates all references to the unaudited pro forma statement of operations include the results of operations of csc for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017 and of hpes for the fiscal year ended january 31 2017 see unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations below for additional information

fiscal 2018 highlights 

during fiscal 2018 we surpassed our first year hpes merger integration milestones delivering over 1 billion  of year one cost takeout the additional savings were primarily driven by workforce optimization actions including the acceleration of management reductions and the global deployment of our automation program bionix these ongoing cost actions address both internal labor as well as third party contractors we further enhanced our workforce management processes to costeffectively deliver existing business while staffing the required labor for new business we also executed on several initiatives to optimize nonlabor spend including ongoing rate negotiations vendor consolidation demand management reductions in maintenance expense and rationalization of facilities 

fiscal 2018 financial highlights include the following

fiscal 2018  compared with fiscal 2017 



  

nm  calculation is not meaningful 

the increase in revenues for fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 was driven by the hpes merger 

as a global company over 56  of our fiscal 2018 revenues were earned internationally as a result the comparison of revenues denominated in currencies other than the us dollar from period to period is impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates constant currency revenues are a nongaap measure calculated by translating current period activity into us dollars using the comparable prior period’s currency conversion rates this information is consistent with how management views our revenues and evaluates our operating performance and trends the table below summarizes our constant currency revenues for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018 compared to pro forma revenues for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017 



  

1  fiscal 2018 revenues are presented at constant currency and include purchase price accounting adjustments of 24 million 98 

    million and 8 million for gbs gis and usps respectively see note 2    acquisitions  

2  our pro forma results of operations are further discussed below in the section “unaudited pro forma combined statement of 

    operations 

our digital revenue cuts across all three of our reporting segments of gbs gis and usps and includes enterprise cloud applications and consulting cloud analytics and security digital revenue grew yearoveryear reflecting our clients’ accelerating shift to digital during fiscal 2018 we also formed a new digital business team to jointly develop digital transformations with our clients leveraging assets from across the company and our partnerships 

global business services 

our gbs segment revenues were 93 billion  for fiscal 2018 representing an increase of 51 billion  over fiscal 2017 the revenue growth is attributed to the hpes merger 

constant currency revenues were 91 billion  for fiscal 2018 compared to 95 billion  for fiscal 2017 on a pro forma basis the 04 billion  decrease was primarily driven by 09 billion of contracts that concluded or were renewed at a lower rate these decreases were partially offset by a 07 billion increase in revenues from new business as well as the contributions from our recent acquisition of tribridge digital revenues in enterprise cloud applications and consulting and analytics grew yearoveryear offset by declines in traditional application services revenues enterprise cloud applications and consulting offerings continue to drive growth through an expanded portfolio of quick start offerings which allow us to rapidly understand the client environment and develop more impactful large scale transformations 

global infrastructure services 

our gis segment revenues were 125 billion  for fiscal 2018 representing an increase of 90 billion  over fiscal 2017 the revenue growth is attributed to the hpes merger 

constant currency revenues were 122 billion  for fiscal 2018 compared to 130 billion  for fiscal 2017 on a pro forma basis the 08 billion  decrease was primarily driven by 13 billion of contracts that concluded or were renewed at a lower rate these decreases were partially offset by a 06 billion increase in revenues from new business cloud revenue grew yearoveryear as clients continue to migrate workloads from legacy infrastructure environments to hybrid cloud environments 

united states public sector 

we began to report the usps segment formerly the hpes us public sector business in fiscal 2018 the usps segment provides infrastructure and other services similar to our gis and gbs segments to all levels of government in the us 

constant currency revenues were 28 billion  for fiscal 2018 compared to 28 billion  for fiscal 2017 on a pro forma basis the yearoveryear comparison of revenues was impacted by an increase in revenues from new business during fiscal 2018 that was offset by the nonrecurrence of a contract reset that resulted in a onetime revenue increase in fiscal 2017 

during fiscal 2018 gbs gis and usps had contract awards of 102 billion  116 billion  and 19 billion  respectively 

fiscal 2017  compared with fiscal 2016   



our fiscal 2017 revenues increased 501 million as compared with fiscal 2016 the increase was due to growth in our gbs segment and revenues from our recent acquisitions the increase in fiscal 2017 revenues was partially offset by a decrease in revenues of 317 million caused by contracts that concluded or were renewed at lower rates and a 221 million adverse impact of foreign currency movement due to the strengthening of the us dollar against the british pound 

the table below summarizes our constant currency revenues for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017 compared to the fiscal year ended april 1 2016 



  

1  fiscal 2017 revenues are presented at constant currency constant currency revenues is a nongaap measure and is 

    further described above in the section “fiscal 2018  compared with fiscal 2017 ” 

global business services 

the 654 million or 180 constant currency increase for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was driven by growth in next generation business processing services offerings as well as contributions from our recent acquisitions primarily within our digital applications business and our iss business where we continue to prioritize the development of our digital capabilities digital applications our enterprise cloud applications and consulting business increased over 38 in constant currency and iss increased over 26 in constant currency when compared to prior fiscal year the increase was largely due to revenues from our recent acquisitions which we continue to integrate into our existing business and new business revenues increased 249 million these increases were partially offset by a 274 million decrease in revenues from contracts that concluded and a 131 million decline from contracts renewed at lower rates 

global infrastructure services 

gis segment constant currency revenues for fiscal 2017 increased 68 million or 20 as compared to fiscal 2016 the increase was primarily due to an increase of 243 million in revenues from new business and an increase in revenues contributed from our recent acquisitions in addition we recognized incremental revenues of 43 million under our gis segments portion of the ip matters agreement see note 3  divestitures these increases were partially offset by decreases in revenues of 335 million from contracts that concluded 89 million from contracts renewed with scope changes and 23 million due to pricedowns we continued to take actions to mitigate the secular headwinds facing our traditional it outsourcing business and focus gis on the next generation digital needs of our clients 

during fiscal 2017 gbs and gis had contract awards of 49 billion  and 37 billion  respectively as compared to fiscal 2016 contract awards of 43 billion  and 43 billion  

costs and expenses 

our total costs and expenses were as follows 



  

1 fiscal 2017 and 2016 costs and expenses are for csc only and therefore are not directly comparable to fiscal 2018 costs and 

   expenses 

during fiscal 2018 we took actions to optimize our workforce extract greater supply chain efficiencies and rationalize our real estate footprint we reduced our labor base by approximately 13  through a combination of automation best shoring and pyramid correction we also rebalanced our skill mix including the addition of more than 18000  new employees and the ongoing retraining of the existing workforce in real estate we restructured over four million square feet of space during fiscal 2018 

costs of services 

fiscal 2018  compared with fiscal 2017 

cost of services excluding depreciation and amortization and restructuring costs cos was 179 billion  for fiscal 2018 as compared to 55 billion  for fiscal 2017 the increase in cos was driven by the hpes merger and was partially offset by reduction in costs associated with our labor base and real estate cos for fiscal 2018 included 192 million  of pension and opeb actuarial and settlement gains associated with our defined benefit pension plans 

fiscal 2017  compared with fiscal 2016   

cos as a percentage of revenues remained consistent year over year the 360 million increase in cos was largely related to our acquisitions and a 31 million gain on the sale of certain intangible assets in our gis segment during fiscal 2016 not present in the current fiscal year this increase was offset by managements ongoing cost reduction initiatives and a yearoveryear favorable change of 28 million to pension and opeb actuarial and settlement losses associated with our defined benefit pension plans the amount of restructuring charges net of reversals excluded from cos was 219 million and 7 million for fiscal 2017 and 2016 respectively 

selling general and administrative 

fiscal 2018  compared with fiscal 2017 

selling general and administrative expense excluding depreciation and amortization and restructuring costs sga was 20 billion  for fiscal 2018 as compared to 13 billion  for fiscal 2017 the increase in sga was driven by the hpes merger integration separation and transactionrelated costs were 408 million  during fiscal 2018 as compared to 305 million during fiscal 2017 

fiscal 2017  compared with fiscal 2016   

  

sga as a percentage of revenues increased 22 to 168 for fiscal 2017 from 146 for fiscal 2016 the increase was due to transaction and integration costs of 305 million associated with our recent acquisitions and the hpes merger an increase of 16 million in the recognition of pension and opeb actuarial and pension settlement losses and a nonrecurring settlement recovery of 16 million recorded as a reduction of sga during fiscal 2016 not present in the current fiscal year these increases were partially offset by higher revenues during fiscal 2017 and 2016 we recognized 15 million and 1 million respectively of actuarial and pension settlement losses gains in sga the amount of restructuring charges net of adjustments excluded from sga was 19 million and 16 million for fiscal 2017 and 2016 respectively 

depreciation and amortization 

fiscal 2018  compared with fiscal 2017 

depreciation and amortization expense da was 20 billion  for fiscal 2018 as compared to 06 billion  for fiscal 2017 the increase in da was attributed to acquired property and equipment and intangible assets associated with the hpes merger 

fiscal 2017  compared with fiscal 2016   

da as a percentage of revenues decreased less than 1 to 85 for fiscal 2017 from 93 for fiscal 2016 due to an increase in revenues for the gbs segment and lower da within the gis segment as a result of reduced capital expenditures from contract terminations as well as a continued focus on capital efficiency the decrease in the da ratio was partially offset by an increase in amortization related to acquisitions primarily within the gbs segment 

restructuring costs 

restructuring costs represent severance related to workforce optimization programs and expense associated with facilities and data center rationalization 

during fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 we initiated certain restructuring actions across our segments the fiscal 2018 restructuring initiatives are intended to reduce our core structure and related operating costs improve our competitiveness and facilitate the achievement of acceptable and sustainable profitability following our recent acquisitions and the hpes merger 

total restructuring costs recorded net of reversals during fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  were 803 million  238 million  and 23 million  respectively the net amounts recorded included 13 million  6 million  and 7 million  of pension benefit augmentations for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively owed to certain employees under legal or contractual obligations these augmentations will be paid as part of normal pension distributions over several years 

see note 19    restructuring costs  for additional information about our restructuring actions 

interest expense and interest income   

fiscal 2018  compared with fiscal 2017 

interest expense for fiscal 2018  was 335 million  as compared to 117 million  in fiscal 2017  the yearoveryear increase in interest expense includes interest expense associated with 56 billion of debt acquired in connection with the hpes merger 

interest income for fiscal 2018  was 89 million  as compared to 35 million  in fiscal 2017  the yearoveryear increase in interest income was due to higher cash balances during fiscal 2018 as compared to the prior fiscal year 

fiscal 2017  compared with fiscal 2016   

interest expense for fiscal 2017 was 117 million as compared to 123 million in fiscal 2016 the yearoveryear decrease in interest expense was due to the fourth quarter fiscal 2016 redemption of our 650 term notes and lower interest rates on our existing debt 

interest income for fiscal 2017 was 35 million as compared to 38 million in fiscal 2016 the decrease in interest income was due to lower average deposit balances in our money market funds and money market deposit accounts during fiscal 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year 

debt extinguishment costs 

during fiscal 2016 csc redeemed all outstanding 650 term notes due march 2018 at par plus redemption premiums related to a makewhole provision and accrued interest debt extinguishment costs of 95 million for fiscal 2016 consists primarily of redemption premiums there were no debt extinguishment costs recorded in fiscal 2018 or fiscal 2017 

other income net 

fiscal 2018  compared with fiscal 2017 

other income net consists of movement in foreign currency exchange rates on our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and the related economic hedges equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and other miscellaneous gains and losses the 72 million  increase in other income for fiscal 2018 was primarily due to foreign currency gain related to a change in the functional currency of a european holding company 

fiscal 2017  compared with fiscal 2016   

the 1 million yearoveryear increase in other income was due to a 7 million yearoveryear benefit of favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates used to fair value our foreign currency forward contracts and the related foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities partially offset by a 6 million gain on sale of certain assets during fiscal 2016 not present in fiscal 2017 

taxes 

our effective tax rate etr on income loss from continuing operations before taxes for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  was 66 425  and 6200  respectively a reconciliation of the differences between the us federal statutory rate and the etr as well as other information about our income tax provision is provided in note 11    income taxes  

in fiscal 2018  the etr was primarily impacted by the effects of the act 

 

in fiscal 2017  the etr was primarily impacted by 



 

in fiscal 2016  the etr was primarily impacted by 

 the irs is examining cscs federal income tax returns for fiscal 2008 through 2016 with respect to cscs fiscal 2008 through 2010 federal tax returns we previously entered into negotiations for a resolution through settlement with the irs office of appeals the irs examined several issues for this audit that resulted in various audit adjustments we have an agreement in principle with the irs office of appeals as to some but not all of these adjustments we have agreed to extend the statute of limitations associated with this audit through april 30 2019 in addition during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 we received a revenue agent’s report with proposed adjustments to cscs fiscal 2011 through 2013 federal returns we have filed a protest of certain of these adjustments to the irs office of appeals the irs is also examining cscs fiscal 2014 through 2016 federal income tax returns we have not received any adjustments for this cycle for hpes entities the irs is examining federal income tax returns for fiscal 2008 through 2012 in addition hpe entities have received a revenue agents report with respect to calendar years 2005 through 2008 and these adjustments were protested to the irs office of appeals we continue to believe that our tax positions are morelikelythannot sustainable and that we will ultimately prevail 

in addition we may settle certain other tax examinations have lapses in statutes of limitations or voluntarily settle income tax positions in negotiated settlements for different amounts than we have accrued as uncertain tax positions we may need to accrue and ultimately pay additional amounts for tax positions that previously met a morelikelythannot standard if such positions are not upheld conversely we could settle positions by payment with the tax authorities for amounts lower than those that have been accrued or extinguish a position through payment we believe the outcomes that are reasonably possible within the next twelve months may result in a reduction in liability for uncertain tax positions of 36 million to 70 million  excluding interest penalties and tax carryforwards 

income from discontinued operations 

income from discontinued operations net of taxes primarily reflects the results of operations of cscs former nps segment which was divested on november 27 2015 there were no discontinued operations in fiscal 2018 or fiscal 2017 

earnings loss per share 

fiscal 2018  compared with fiscal 2017 

diluted eps for fiscal 2018  was 604  an increase of 692  per share compared with the prior fiscal year the increase was due to an increase of 1874 million  in net income attributable to dxc common stockholders partially offset by an increase in weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted eps attributable to capital restructuring associated with the hpes merger 

diluted eps for fiscal 2018  includes 206  per share of restructuring costs 100  per share of transaction separation and integrationrelated costs 137  per share of amortization of acquired intangible assets 060  per share of pension and opeb actuarial and settlement gains and 194  per share reflecting the estimated nonrecurring benefit of the act 

fiscal 2017  compared with fiscal 2016   

diluted eps from continuing operations in fiscal 2017 decreased 138 per share to 088 per share primarily due to 403 million of transaction and integration related costs during fiscal 2017 for the hpes merger and other acquisitions in addition restructuring costs increased 215 million as compared to the same period in the prior year these decreases were partially offset by the nonrecurrence of fiscal 2016 debt extinguishment costs of 95 million 

total diluted eps for fiscal 2017 decreased 266 per share due to the reasons mentioned above for eps from continuing operations and the lack of discontinued operations associated with the separation of nps during the current fiscal year 

unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations 

in an effort to provide investors with additional information we are disclosing certain unaudited pro forma financial information of dxc for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017  as supplemental information herein the following unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations of dxc the “unaudited pro forma statement of operations” is for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017  after giving effect to the hpes merger see note 1    summary of significant accounting policies  and note 2    acquisitions  for additional information about the hpes merger 

csc reported its results based on a fiscal year convention that comprised four thirteenweek quarters every fifth year included an additional week in the first quarter to prevent the fiscal year moving from an approximate end of march date hpes reported its results on a fiscal year basis ended october 31 as a consequence of csc and hpes having different fiscal yearend dates all references to the unaudited pro forma statement of operations include the results of operations of csc for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017 and of hpes for the fiscal year ended january 31 2017 

the historical combined statement of operations of hpes was “carvedout” from the combined statement of operations of hpe and reflects assumptions and allocations made by hpe the combined statement of operations of hpes included all revenues and costs directly attributable to hpes and an allocation of expenses related to certain hpe corporate functions the results of operations in the hpes historical combined statement of operations does not necessarily include all expenses that would have been incurred by hpes had it been a separate standalone entity actual costs that may have been incurred if hpes had been a standalone company would depend on a number of factors including the chosen organizational structure functions outsourced or performed by employees and strategic decisions made in areas such as information technology and infrastructure consequently hpes’ historical combined statement of operations does not necessarily reflect what hpes’ results of operations would have been had hpes operated as a standalone company during the period presented 

the unaudited pro forma statement of operations has been prepared using the acquisition method of accounting with csc considered the accounting acquirer of hpes the unaudited pro forma statement of operations combines the historical results of csc and hpes reflects preliminary purchase accounting adjustments and aligns accounting policies of csc and hpes the historical statements of operations have been adjusted in the unaudited pro forma statement of operations to give effect to pro forma events that were i directly attributable to the hpes merger ii factually supportable and iii which are expected to have a continuing impact on the consolidated results of operations of dxc the pro forma results do not reflect the costs of integration activities or benefits that may result from realization of firstyear synergies 

the adjustments included in the unaudited pro forma statement of operations were based upon currently available information and assumptions that management of dxc believes to be reasonable the unaudited pro forma statement of operations is for informational purposes only and is not intended to represent or to be indicative of the actual results of operations that the combined company would have reported had the hpes merger been completed on april 2 2016 and should not be taken as being indicative of dxc’s future consolidated financial results

liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents and cash flows 

as of march 31 2018 our cash and cash equivalents cash were 26 billion  of which 10 billion  was held outside of the united states a substantial portion of funds can be returned to the us from funds advanced previously to finance our foreign acquisition initiatives as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 and after the mandatory onetime income inclusion deemed repatriation of the historically untaxed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries we expect a significant portion of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries will no longer be subject to us income tax consequences upon a subsequent repatriation to the united states however a portion of this cash may still be subject to foreign and state income tax consequences upon future remittance therefore if additional funds held outside the us are needed for our operations in the united states we plan to repatriate these funds based on a preliminary analysis we have recorded a provisional estimate for foreign withholding taxes state taxes and india dividend distribution tax of 99 million as described in note 11    income taxes  we have changed our permanent reinvestment assertion on our foreign subsidiaries and will no longer consider current and accumulated earnings for all nonus subsidiaries permanently reinvested except for current year and future indian earnings 

cash and cash equivalents increased 14 billion  during fiscal 2018 to 26 billion  primarily due to growth in our business the following table summarizes our cash flow activity 



operating cash flow 

net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2018 was 3243 million  as compared to 978 million  during fiscal 2017 the increase of 2265 million  was predominately due to an increase in net income of 1882 million  the increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2018 was partially offset by additional deferred tax adjustments to operating activities of 842 million  and an increase in the gain on pension and other postemployment benefits of 307 million  

net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2017 increased 176 million as compared to fiscal 2016 the increase was due to an increase in trade payables of 411 million a decrease in net account receivables of 457 million 32 million less restructuring charges compared to fiscal 2016 and a cash outflow of 190 million for sec settlement paid in fiscal 2016 with no comparative outflow for the current year in addition payments received from csra under the amended ip matters agreement increased 35 million the increase in operating cash flows was partially offset by a 189 million increase in payments for transaction and integrationrelated costs an increase in the deferred purchase price receivable of 252 million and a 545 million decrease in net income adjusted for noncash transactions from fiscal 2016 

investing cash flow 

net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2018 decreased   893 million  to 33 million  the decrease was predominantly due to net cash provided by acquisitions of 735 million  during fiscal 2018 compared with cash paid for acquisitions of 434 million  during fiscal 2017 the decrease in net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by an increase in cash payments for outsourcing contract costs of 227 million  software purchases of 71 million  and a restricted cash outflow of 67 million  primarily related to our federal receivables sales facility 

net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2017 decreased 254 million to 926 million this decrease was driven by a decline of 120 million spent on acquisitions and a decline in capital expenditures of 150 million 

financing cash flow 

net cash used by financing activities during fiscal 2018 was 1890 million  as compared to 93 million  during fiscal 2017 the 1983 million  increase in net cash used by financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in credit facility draws net of repayments of 868 million  additional payments on capitalized lease obligations of 915 million  additional payments on longterm debt obligations of 1379 million  and 132 million  in payments for repurchases of common stock these cash outflows were partially offset by draws on longterm debt of 462 million  and cash proceeds from bond issuance of 989 million  

net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2017 was 93 million as compared to cash used of 485 million during fiscal 2016 the decline was due primarily to certain fiscal 2016 cash outflows that did not reoccur during fiscal 2017 including a 350 million repayment of our 25 term notes a 313 million special cash dividend paid as part of the nps separation a 95 million payment for the early extinguishment of debt and payments of 73 million for treasury stock that occurred during fiscal 2016 these declines of cash used in financing activities were partially offset by a 254 million payment of acquired debt from the acquisition of xchanging and 85 million in net proceeds from the structured sale of our uk campus 

capital resources 

see note 20    commitments and contingencies  for a discussion of the general purpose of guarantees and commitments the anticipated sources of funds to fulfill such commitments are listed below and under the subheading liquidity 

the following table summarizes out total debt 



the 54 billion  increase in total debt during fiscal 2018 was attributed primarily to debt assumed in connection with the hpes merger 

the maturity chart below summarizes the future maturities of longterm debt principal for fiscal years subsequent to march 31 2018 and excludes maturities of borrowings for assets acquired under longterm financing and capitalized lease liabilities 

during fiscal 2018 we increased commitments under our revolving credit facility to 38 billion from 30 billion prehpes merger and completed a senior bond offering in an aggregate principal amount of 650 million due 2021 the proceeds of which were used to retire the outstanding usd term loan due 2021 additionally we entered into an unsecured €400 million term loan agreement maturing during may 2018 which was subsequently replaced by longterm debt maturing in fiscal 2020 and we entered into amendments to our existing aud term loan to increase total borrowings to aud 275 million we also issued £250 million of senior notes maturing in 2025 the proceeds from these borrowings were used to make prepayments to term loans maturing in 2022 and fully repay the borrowings under revolving credit facilities 

  

during fiscal 2018 we completed a debt exchange offer whereby 234 million principal amount of the 300 million senior notes the “eds notes” were tendered to dxc in exchange for a like principal amount of dxc notes with identical maturity and interest rate as of march 31 2018 dxc held approximately 234 million principal amount of the eds notes that were tendered and which are eliminated upon financial statement consolidation while the remaining 66 million principal amount of the eds notes outstanding were held by public noteholders subsequent to the period end dxc extinguished on may 25 2018 the 234 million principal amount of eds notes that it held in preparation for the usps separation and mergers the 66 million principal amount of eds notes that remain outstanding will remain with the legal entity that is spinning off with the usps separation 

we were in compliance with all financial covenants associated with our borrowings as of march 31 2018 and march 31 2017 for more information on our debt see note 12    debt  

the following table summarizes our capitalization ratios 



  

1 net debt and net debttototal capitalization are nongaap measures used by management to assess our ability to service our debts using only our cash and cash equivalents we present these nongaap measures to assist investors in analyzing our capital structure in a more comprehensive way compared to gross debt based ratios alone 

the decrease in net debttototal capitalization was primarily due to a 40 billion  increase in net debt and a 117 billion  increase in equity which were primarily a result of the hpes merger 

as of march 31 2018 our credit ratings were as follows 



liquidity 

we expect our existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our normal operating requirements for the next 12 months we expect to continue to use cash generated by operations as a primary source of liquidity however should we require funds greater than that generated from our operations to fund discretionary investment activities such as business acquisitions we have the ability to draw on our multicurrency revolving credit facility or raise capital through the issuance of capital market debt instruments such as commercial paper term loans and bonds however there can be no guarantee that we will be able to obtain debt financing if required on terms and conditions acceptable to us if at all in the future 

our exposure to operational liquidity risk is primarily from longterm contracts which require significant investment of cash during the initial phases of the contracts the recovery of these investments is over the life of the contract and is dependent upon our performance as well as customer acceptance 

the following table summarizes our total liquidity 



share repurchases 

during fiscal 2018 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 20 billion  of our common stock this program became effective on april 3 2017 and no end date was established during fiscal 2018 we repurchased 1537782  shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 137 million  

dividends 

during fiscal 2018 the board of directors of dxc declared aggregate cash dividends to our stockholders of 072  per share or approximately 209 million  future dividends are subject to customary board review and approval prior to declaration 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business we are a party to arrangements that include guarantees the receivables securitization facility receivables sales arrangements and financial instruments with offbalance sheet risk such as letters of credit and surety bonds we also use performance letters of credit to support various risk management insurance policies no liabilities related to these arrangements are reflected in balance sheets see note 5    receivables  and note 20    commitments and contingencies  for additional information regarding these offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

contractual obligations 

  

our contractual obligations as of march 31 2018  were as follows 



  

1 amounts represent scheduled principal payments of longterm debt and mandatory redemption of preferred stock of a consolidated subsidiary 

2 includes longterm purchase agreements with certain software hardware telecommunication and other service providers and exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty if we do not meet the specified service minimums we may have an obligation to pay the service provider a portion of or the entire shortfall 

3 the calculated amount for transition tax is payable over eight years 8 of net tax liability in each of years 15 15 in year 6 20 in year 7 and 25 in year 8 this amount has been calculated provisionally under sab 118 and is subject to change in future periods see note 11    income taxes  for additional information about the transition tax and for the estimated liability related to unrecognized tax benefits which has been omitted from this table 

4 amounts represent scheduled interest payments on longterm debt and scheduled dividend payments associated with the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of a consolidated subsidiary excluding contingent dividends associated with the participation and variable appreciation premium features 

5 see note 13    pension and other benefit plans  for the estimated liability related to estimated future benefit payments under our pension and opeb plans that have been omitted from this table 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities these estimates may change in the future if underlying assumptions or factors change accordingly actual results could differ materially from our estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions we consider the following policies to be critical because of their complexity and the high degree of judgment involved in implementing them revenue recognition income taxes business combinations defined benefit plans and valuation of assets we have discussed the selection of our critical accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 

revenue recognition 

most of our revenues are recognized based on objective criteria and do not require significant estimates that may change over time however some arrangements are subject to specific accounting guidance that may require significant estimates including contracts which include multipleelement deliverables 

multipleelement arrangements 

many of our contracts require us to provide a range of services or elements to our customers which may include a combination of services products or both as a result significant judgment may be required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the elements specified in a multipleelement arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and when considered appropriate how the total revenues should be allocated among the elements and the timing of revenue recognition for each element if vendor specific objective evidence is not available allocation of total contract consideration to each element requires estimating the fair value or selling price of each element based on third party evidence or managements best estimate of selling price for the 

deliverables when third party evidence tpe is not available tpe is established by considering our competitors prices for comparable product and service offerings in the market in which we operate when we conclude that comparable products or services are sold by competitors to similarly situated customers we consult available information sources such as published list prices quoted market prices and industry reports to estimate tpe we establish a best estimate of selling price consistent with our existing pricing practices involving a costplusreasonablemargin methodology as well as comparison of the margins to those realized on recent contracts for similar products or services in that market once the total revenues have been allocated to the various contract elements revenues for each element are recognized based on the relevant revenue recognition method for the services performed or elements delivered if the revenue recognition criteria have been met estimates of total revenues at contract inception often differ materially from actual revenues due to volume differences changes in technology or other factors which may not be foreseen at inception 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes analyzing our income tax reserves the determination of the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets and adjustment of valuation allowances accordingly in addition our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions for example we are currently undergoing irs audits for cscs fiscal 2008 through 2016 us federal tax returns 

as a global enterprise our etr is affected by many factors including our global mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates the extent to which our nonus earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the us changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets changes in tax regulations acquisitions dispositions and the tax characteristics of our income we cannot predict what our etr will be in the future because there is uncertainty regarding these factors 

as a result of the hpes merger and changes in us cash requirements a deferred tax liability of 542 million  was recorded for us income taxes based on the estimated historical taxable earnings of the hpes foreign subsidiaries in addition we recorded an estimated liability of 50 million  for india ddt tax based on estimated historical taxable earnings of the hpes india subsidiary these liabilities were recorded as part of acquisition accounting 

as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act the act we have changed our asc 74030 assertion with respect to the remaining csc foreign subsidiaries and no longer consider current and accumulated earnings for all nonus subsidiaries permanently reinvested except for current year indian earnings the deferred tax liability relating to hpes foreign subsidiaries of 554 million  has been released and our estimated liability for india ddt was increased by 30 million  to 80 million  to include estimated historical taxable earnings for csc indian subsidiaries for those subsidiaries from which we were able to make a reasonable estimate of the tax effects of our change in assertion we have recorded a provisional estimate for withholding taxes state taxes and india ddt of 12 million  7 million  and 80 million  respectively for those subsidiaries which we were not able to make a reasonable estimate we have not recorded any deferred taxes we will record the tax effects of any change in our prior assertion with respect to these subsidiaries and disclose any unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to our foreign subsidiaries if practicable in the period that we are first able to make a reasonable estimate no later than december 2018 

considerations impacting the recoverability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates in determining whether the deferred tax assets are realizable we consider all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences taxable income in prior carryback years projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations we recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of approximately  14 billion  as of march 31 2018 due to uncertainties related to the ability to utilize these assets however valuation allowances are subject to change in future reporting periods due to changes in various factors 

changes in tax laws such as the act or changes in tax laws resulting from the organization for economic cooperation and development’s multijurisdictional plan of action to address “base erosion and profit shifting” could impact our effective tax rate the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex changing tax regulations as discussed in note 11  income taxes for example the act provides provisions that limit interest expense provide for immediate expensing of qualified assets further limits executive compensation deductions generally eliminates federal tax on foreign dividend distributions subjects certain payments from us corporations to foreign 

related parties to additional taxes places restrictions or eliminates certain exclusions deductions and credits and generally broadens the tax base further guidance for these provisions is forthcoming and the laws are subject to change in future periods 

the finance act of 2012 the 2012 finance act was signed into law in india on may 28 2012 the 2012 finance act provides for the taxation of indirect foreign investment in india including on a retroactive basis the 2012 finance act overrides the vodafone nl ruling by the supreme court of india which held that the indian tax authorities cannot assess capital gains taxes on the sale of shares of nonindian companies that indirectly own shares in an indian company the retroactive nature of these changes in law has been strongly criticized and challenged in the indian courts however there is no assurance that such a challenge will be successful we have engaged in the purchase of shares of foreign companies that indirectly own shares of an indian company and internal reorganizations involving indian companies the indian tax authorities may seek to apply the provisions of the 2012 finance act to these prior transactions and seek to tax us directly or as a withholding agent or representative assessee of the sellers involved in prior acquisitions we believe that the 2012 finance act does not apply to these prior acquisitions and that we have strong defenses against any claims that might be raised by the indian tax authorities 

the uk finance no 2 act 2017 was passed into law on 16 november 2017 enacting measures deferred from the finance act 201719 the legislation imposes with effect from 1 april 2017 restrictions on the utilization of prior period losses against current period profits and limitations on interest deductions we do not expect there to be a material impact on our financial statements as a result of this legislation 

business combinations 

we account for the acquisition of a business using the acquisition method of accounting which requires us to estimate the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed this includes acquired intangible assets such as customerrelated intangibles the liabilities assumed and contingent consideration if any liabilities assumed may include litigation and other contingency reserves existing at the time of acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining the related fair values independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities such appraisals are based on significant estimates provided by us such as forecasted revenues or profits utilized in determining the fair value of contractrelated acquired intangible assets or liabilities significant changes in assumptions and estimates subsequent to completing the allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired as well as differences in actual and estimated results could result in material impacts to our financial results adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in earnings additional information related to the acquisition date fair value of acquired assets and liabilities obtained during the allocation period not to exceed one year may result in changes to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the business acquired 

defined benefit plans 

  

the computation of our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations is dependent on various assumptions inherent in the application of the actuarial methods are key assumptions including discount rates expected longterm rates of return on plan assets mortality rates rates of compensation increases and medical cost trend rates our management evaluates these assumptions annually and updates assumptions as necessary the fair value of assets is determined based on observable inputs for similar assets or on significant unobservable inputs if not available two of the most significant assumptions are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate our weighted average rates used were 



the assumption for the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is impacted by the expected asset mix of the plan judgments regarding the correlation between historical excess returns and future excess returns and expected investment expenses the discount rate assumption is based on current market rates for highquality fixed income debt instruments with maturities similar to the expected duration of the benefit payment period the following table provides the 

impact changes in the weightedaverage assumptions would have had on our net periodic pension benefits and settlement and contractual termination charges for fiscal 2018 



valuation of assets 

we review longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill for impairment in accordance with our accounting policy disclosed in note 1   summary of significant accounting policies  assessing the fair value of assets involves significant estimates and assumptions including estimation of future cash flows the timing of such cash flows and discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in projecting future cash flows the valuation of longlived and intangible assets involves management estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of assets particularly purchased intangible assets these estimates are subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and forecasts 

evaluation of goodwill for impairment requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors changes in these estimates and assumptions include a significant change in the business climate established business plans operating performance indicators or competition which could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach using market multiples the discount rate used in an income approach is based on our weightedaverage cost of capital and may be adjusted for the relevant risks associated with businessspecific characteristics and any uncertainty related to a reporting units ability to execute on the projected future cash flows 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as a multinational company we are exposed to certain market risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates changes in foreign currency exchange rates can impact our foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions in foreign currency whereas changes in benchmark interest rates can impact interest expense associated with our floating interest rate debt and the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks including operating and financing activities and the use of derivative instruments we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

presented below is a description of our risks together with a sensitivity analysis of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates the foreign currency model incorporates the impact of diversification from holding multiple currencies and the correlation of revenues costs and any related shortterm contract financing in the same currency in order to determine the impact of changes in interest rates on our future results of operations and cash flows we calculated the increase or decrease in the index underlying these rates we estimate the fair value of our longterm debt primarily using an expected present value technique using interest rates offered to us for instruments with similar terms and remaining maturities these analyses reflect managements view of changes that are reasonably possible to occur over a oneyear period 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to both favorable and unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates in the ordinary course of business we enter into contracts denominated in foreign currencies exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising from these contracts is analyzed during the contract bidding process we generally manage these contracts by incurring costs in the same currency in which revenues are received and any related shortterm contract financing requirements are met by borrowing in the same currency thus by generally matching revenues costs and borrowings to the same currency we are able to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency risk to earnings however due to our increased use of offshore labor centers we have become more exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we experienced significant foreign currency fluctuations during fiscal 2018 due primarily to the volatility of the euro in relation to the us dollar and during fiscal 2017 and 2016 due primarily to the volatility of the british pound in relation to the us dollar 

we have policies and procedures to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency by using shortterm foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities including intercompany accounts and loans for accounting purposes these foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedges and changes in their fair value are reported in current period earnings within other income expense net in the statements of operations we also use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risk related to certain indian rupee denominated intercompany obligations and forecasted transactions for accounting purposes these foreign currency forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges with critical terms that match the hedged items therefore the changes in fair value of these forward contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income net of taxes in the statements of comprehensive income and subsequently classified into net income in the period during which the hedged transactions are recognized in net income 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than us dollar see note 18    segment and geographic information  during fiscal 2018  approximately 56  of our revenues were generated outside of the united states for the year ended march 31 2018  a hypothetical 10  change in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would have changed revenues by approximately 6  or 14 billion  the majority of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency and as a result there would not be a material change to our income from continuing operations before taxes as such in the view of management the resulting impact would not be material to our results of operations or cash flows 

interest rate risk 

as of march 31 2018 we had outstanding debt with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of 84 billion  of which 36 billion  was floating interest rate debt most of our floating interest rate debt is based upon varying terms of adjusted libor rates consequently changes in libor result in the most volatility to our interest expense pursuant to our interest rate and risk management strategy we had a series of interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of 635 million  these instruments hedged the variability of cash outflows for interest payments on certain floating interest rate debt which effectively converted 635 million  of our floating interest rate debt into fixed interest rate debt as of march 31 2018 an assumed 10  unfavorable change in interest rates would not be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flows a change in interest rates related to our longterm debt would not have a material impact on our financial statements as we do not record our debt at fair value
